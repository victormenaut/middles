TRAFFIC GLOSSARY
DRIVE
Driver means basically the person having control of the direction and movement of the vehicle and drive and driving are construed accordingly.
In most of the authoritative cases the direction is taken to be the steering and the movement is taken to be the acceleration and braking.
Problems arise where a person is not fully in control of direction and movement.
In Ames v MacLeod , 1969 S.C.
1 and R v McDonagh [1974]RTR 372 a test was suggested, namely ‘whether the person was in a substantial sense controlling the movement and direction of the car’.
Where this test is satisfied it is not conclusive proof that the person is ‘driving’ and it must be asked whether the person can be said to be ‘driving’under the ordinary meaning of that word.
Examples which have been held to be ‘driving’ which do not readily fall within the above definition include:
(a)
Where a girl was in the front passenger seat and leaned across controlling the steering wheel with both hands, being within reach of the ignition and the hand brake.
Her companion in the driver's seat who controlled the gears and the foot controls was also held to be driving.
(b)
A person sitting behind the steering wheel being pushed by people outside the vehicle, if he is acting in conjunction with those people.
The people pushing will aid and abet the driver.
(c)
A learner driver sitting behind the steering wheel is a  driver even though the qualified driver has control of the vehicle as well and could also be said to be driving.
A ‘steersman’ in a towed vehicle will be held to be ‘driving’if the extent and degree of control could be said to correctly describe ‘driving’(R v MacDonagh ,[1974]RTR 372 and McQuaid v Anderton ,[1980]3 All ER 540).
Pedalling an auto-assisted bicycle without starting the engine has been held to be driving away.
It is felt that a person propelling a motor cycle with his legs astride the cycle and his feet on the ground by ‘paddling’ it, would be driving.
MOTOR VEHICLE
A motor vehicle means a mechanically propelled vehicle intended or adapted for use on roads.
A good illustration of ‘intended’ is found in the case of Childs v Coghlan (1968) 112 Sol Jo 175 where a 30 ton earth mover which was made for use on construction sites and not roads was held to be a motor vehicle.
As it was too large to be put on a lorry to be moved from site to site it had to travel on roads under its own power and was held to be intended to be used on roads.
Dumper trucks will normally not be classified as motor vehicles as they are not intended or adapted for use on roads.
A Go-Kart is in a similar position, but both a dumper truck and a Go-Kart can become ‘motor vehicles’ if it can be proved that they have been adapted or intended for use on roads.
Its use at any particular time does not prove ‘intended’.
Proof of regular use on the road is usually called for.
‘Adapted’ means fit and apt for the purpose.
A test was laid down in 1987 as to whether a vehicle was intended or adapted for use on roads .
It is whether a reasonable person, looking at the vehicle, and forming a view as to its general use, would say the vehicle might well be  used on the road.
Chief Constable of Avon and Somerset v Fleming [1987]1 All ER 318.
MECHANICALLY PROPELLED VEHICLE
As a start one should ask, ‘Is the vehicle constructed so that it can be mechanically propelled?’ i.e. is there a mechanical means of propulsion other than‘person power’alone, e.g. pedalling a pedal cycle.
Mechanical propulsion presently ranges from steam, through the various petrols and oils to gas and electric, with nuclear or magnetic etc. vehicles around the corner.
Helpful explanations can be found in the following cases:
1.
Don't ask whether the engine is in working order but ask ‘Is the vehicle constructed so that it can be mechanically propelled?’
R v Tashin [1970]RTR 88.
2.
A temporary removal of the engine does not stop a vehicle being a ‘mechanically propelled vehicle’.
Newberry v Simmonds [1961]2 All ER 318.
The opposite was held where the vehicle was a broken down wreck in Smart v Allan [1962]3 All ER 893.
3.
But see Binks v Department of the Environment (1975) 119 Sol Jo 304 where a severely damaged car which the owner intended to repair, was held to be a mechanically propelled vehicle.
ROAD
Road is defined as any highway and any other road to which the public has access and includes bridges over which a road passes.
Highway is narrower in meaning than road and there must be some evidence of permanent dedication to the public.
A court should take any map or plan, etc. into account when deliberating on the question of what is a highway.
The main factor for a road is public access, but where to  draw the line causes difficulty.
It was held in Cox v White [1976]Crim LR 263 that a mere slight degree of access by the public is not sufficient.
General cases of interest concerning this definition include:
(a)
Harrison v Hill [1932]SC (J) 13 where a road maintained by a farmer, leading from the public road to his farmhouse, was held to be a road, the farmer turned away people who were using it from time to time but it was also used by people having no business at the farm;
(b)
In Bugge v Taylor (1940) 104 JP 467 the forecourt of a hotel was held to be a road.
It was private property, but was used as a short cut from one street to another.
(NOTE that for ‘road’ there must be a line of communication which can be described as a road and it is not sufficient merely to show vehicles have access, e.g. to a car-park); and
(c)
There is a rebuttable presumption that the highway includes everything between the fence or boundary wall etc., e.g. grass verges, footpaths and central reservations.
But this is so only where the fence etc. was erected with reference to the highway and would probably not apply where the fence was erected for some other reason (A.G. v Beynon ,[1969]2 All ER 263).
PUBLIC PLACE
‘Public place’ has been added to certain offences under the road traffic legislation to enlarge the use of the offences.
Although not defined under the Road Traffic Act it is considered that having regard to the spirit of the legislation that the definition used in other Acts would apply viz: Includes any place to which the public have access whether on payment or otherwise, e.g. fields where the public can park for a race meeting or traction engine rally, footpaths or bridleways (unless the Act states otherwise: see section 22A (5) of the Road Traffic Act 1988), or anywhere where the public could be at risk from mechanically propelled vehicles.
NB Case law has held that the following were not public places — a public house car park outside licensing hours, and land open only to members of a proprietary club.
THAT YOU
‘That you’ prefaces most summons headings and merely means that the prosecution must be in a position to prove that the defendant in court is the person who they alleged committed the offence.
It is very unlikely, although not unknown, that the defendant will deny being present etc, at the time of the offence.
He may still plead not guilty while admitting that he is the person concerned in the alleged offence.
TRAILER
Trailer means vehicle drawn by a motor vehicle.
‘Vehicle’ was discussed in Boxer v Snelling [1972]RTR 472 where it was said that in borderline cases not only the construction or nature of the contrivance but also the circumstances of its use should be taken into account.
A stall with wheels was held to be a vehicle in this case.
A motor vehicle which is being towed by another motor vehicle both remains a motor vehicle and also becomes a trailer.
Therefore, such a towed motor vehicle can be subject to offences of using without tax, insurance or in contravention of the Construction and Use Regulations.
USE, CAUSE OR PERMIT
(a)
USE — means ‘to have the use of the motor vehicle on a road’.
The following cases will help to illustrate the variety of uses recognised by the courts —
(i)
a vehicle placed on a road with the battery removed and incapable of being driven at all 
(ii)
when stationary on a road for loading or unloading;
(iii)
a vehicle being towed is apparently being ‘used’.
Note that where the offence in question gave alternatives of using, causing or permitting the use thereof, ‘uses’ is interpreted rather more strictly and restricted than when an offence commences ‘Did use’, with no other alternatives.
In such a restricted case, where there is a master-servant relationship it can usually be said that the master or employer ‘uses’ as well as the driver, being the servant or employee.
In Green v Burnett [1954]3 All ER 273 it was held that an employer was guilty of ‘using’, as a vehicle with defective brakes was being used on his business.
The Motor Vehicle (Construction and Use) Regulations generally impose an absolute liability even though an employer, as in this case, had no knowledge of the defect.
In effect there is no necessity for mens rea or guilty knowledge in using offences.
(b)
CAUSE — means some express or positive mandate from the person ‘causing’ to the driver etc.
Mens rea or guilty knowledge must be proved by the prosecution where a person is reported for an offence of ‘causing’.
(c)
PERMITTING — means an express or implied permission and does not involve any order to take a vehicle on the roads.
As with ‘cause’mens rea must be proved.
In practice, ‘uses’ is probably the easiest to prove and the hardest to disprove.
VEHICLE
This is wider in meaning than ‘motor vehicle’ as ‘vehicles’do not need to be mechanically propelled.
Therefore, trailers  and bicycles, as well as all kinds of mechanically propelled vehicles, are ‘vehicles’.
A court will most likely look at the circumstances in which the article was used as well as the construction, nature or function of it, in cases of difficulty.
CARELESS AND INCONSIDERATE DRIVING
Section 3 Road Traffic Act 1988 as amended by the Road Traffic Act 1991
(A) POINTS TO PROVE
l.
That you
2.
did drive
3.
a certain mechanically propelled vehicle, namely a…
4.
on a road or other public place called…
.
5.
(a)
without due care and attention or
(b)
without reasonable consideration for other persons using the road or place.
(B) MEANING OF TERMS
1.
‘That you ’ Means the person driving the mechanically propelled vehicle (i.e. identity).
2.
‘did drive ’
3.
‘a certain mechanically propelled vehicle , namely a…
‘This phrase replaces ‘motor vehicle’ as defined on page two.
In the case of certain motor vehicles such as dumper trucks, the prosecution had to prove that they were intended or adapted for use on roads.
All this offence now requires is that the vehicle in question is mechanically propelled.
See glossary ante .
4.
‘on a road or other public place called…
’ The phrase ‘other public place’.
has been added.
Although not defined it is considered that the definition used in other Acts will apply ie. ‘Includes any place to which the public have access, whether on payment or otherwise’.
Suffice it  to say that the offence can now be committed in many more places than before.
See glossary.
5(a)
‘without due care and attention’ Means that the driver did not exercise that degree of care and attention which a reasonable and prudent driver would exercise in the circumstances.
Each case will be decided on its own facts.
Tidy v Battman [1934]1 KB 319, CA.
5(b)
‘without reasonable consideration for other persons using the road’ Means that reasonable consideration was not shown, e.g. where a pedestrian is splashed by a car going through an obviously large puddle which could have been avoided, where headlights are left on full beam, so as to become a potential or an actual hazard, or when a driver changes lanes without reasonable consideration for other road users.
In this case a driver may well have exercised due care and attention but the offence of driving without reasonable consideration may still be committed.
Dangerous driving is usually reserved for intentional dangerous driving or where it can be proved the defendant was driving in such a way as to fall within the new definition of ‘driving dangerously’ in section 2A (1) to (4) of the Road Traffic Act 1988.
(C) USUAL METHODS OF PROVING THESE POINTS
1.
‘That you ’ Cases are sometimes lost when the prosecution fails to identify the driver.
This can be done simply by a witness being asked in court, ‘Is the defendant the man you saw driving at the time of the offence?’
Problem areas include where two people share the controlling of the movement and direction of the vehicle.
It was held in Tyler v Whatmore [1976]RTR 83 that two people can actually drive the same vehicle, at the same time.
Here  the front seat passenger leaned across the person sitting in the driver's seat and with both hands on the steering wheel, steered the car.
The other person still controlled the propulsion.
Another problem arises where two people admit to being the driver of a vehicle and the police are unable to prove or disprove either statement.
Offences such as wasting police time and perverting the course of justice could be considered, with the possibility of both being taken to court as drivers and letting the court decide.
2.
‘did drive ’ Driving is usually proved by witness statements to the effect that they saw the defendant drive.
In the absence of witnesses, only a confession on the part of the defendant or sufficient circumstantial evidence will substantiate the offence.
Circumstantial evidence may include that the defendant was the only person with the car keys; he was seen getting out of the vehicle; he was seen going towards or getting in the vehicle and/or he said he was going to drive the vehicle.
3.
‘a certain mechanically propelled vehicle , namely a…
’ Mechanically propelled vehicles can be proved by a phrase in a witness statement to the effect ‘I saw him driving a Jaguar saloon motor car, registered number…‘
In borderline cases, such as broken down vehicles or power assisted pedal cycles, recourse must be had to the case law.
See glossary.
No doubt more case law will be forthcoming on the meaning of ‘mechanically propelled’.
Expert evidence from a suitably qualified mechanical engineer may be necessary on a few occasions.
4.
‘on a road or other public place called…
’ Road is defined as ‘any highway or any other road to which  the public has access and includes bridges over which a road passes’.
In problematical cases the following test might help —
Has the general public access?
If Yes, then it is a road.
If No, then is a majority class or a minority class restricted from using it?
If only a minority class, then it will probably still be a road but if otherwise, generally not, unless it is a ‘public place’.
See glossary.
Where a road is shown on a ‘definitive’ map prepared under the Countryside Act 1968, Schedule 3, as a ‘byway open to all traffic’this can be taken as conclusive evidence that the public have access.
However, where a right of way was only shown as a footpath on a definitive map, the court can still hold that it was a ‘road’.
Attorney General v Honeywill and Others [1972]3 All ER 641.
5(a)
‘without due care and attention’ Due care and attention is normally used when the defendant has been careless or has been momentarily inattentive.
It can be proved by witnesses stating that they saw the defendant ‘drive round the roundabout and wander into the side of another car’ or ‘brake rather late and run into the car in front’or by the defendant stating that ‘I misjudged the gap or distance’or ‘I didn't see the other car, motorbike, cycle or pedestrian, etc.’
5(b)
‘without reasonable consideration for other persons using the road’.
In practice ‘reasonable consideration for other road users’ can be proved by a statement from a witness who saw the actions which amount to lack of consideration.
The defendant may wish to make a statement under caution which may prove or help to prove these elements.
(D) SUPPORTING EVIDENCE
Generally the following excuses etc. are pertinent to this offence:
(a)
Automatism: Any involuntary movement of body or limb, e.g. epileptic fit, or under attack from a swarm of bees.
This is usually a good defence and should be borne in mind when preparing the case.
(b)
The offender's non-observance of other vehicles or traffic signs etc. is generally no defence, e.g. ‘I didn't see the other car’ or ‘I didn't see the ‘stop’sign’.
(c)
Excuses based on weather conditions, visibility and the condition of the road surface etc. are generally poor defences, unless the driver takes immediate evasive action.
Where a driver says ‘I was blinded by the sun’ or ‘There was a patch of fog’or ‘The road was covered with black ice’, he should have stopped, reduced his speed or driven at a speed which was safe.
If he drove on regardless of the conditions he could well be convicted.
When compiling a case, attention must be paid to the prevailing conditions, especially where the above excuses are put forward, e.g. in a case where the effect of weather may be a possible defence.
(d)
Mechanical defect: The defence of any mechanical defect that caused or contributed towards the offence is normally good.
But where the defect or fault should have been detected during normal maintenance, this would not constitute a defence and there would probably be an offence under the appropriate Construction and Use Regulations.
In the case of R v Spurge [1961]2 All ER 688 it was held that it was at least careless driving where the driver took a vehicle on a road, knowing there was a defect such as defective steering or brakes.
(e)
Defences based on matters outside the driver's control such as a dog running into the path of the car or a tree being  blown across the road are generally good.
The presence of the dog at the time of the offence is hard to disprove in the absence of the dead or injured dog or a witness.
(f)
The Highway Code does not create offences but can be quoted by the prosecution or defence to help negate or establish liability.
(g)
Evidence of speed at the time of the offence can be established from the length of skid marks, the severity of any impact damage or from witnesses etc.
(h)
Other minor points which may be helpful would include: The position of the gear lever after an accident; what the speedometer registers if damaged in an accident; the position of other instruments, such as obligatory light switches or windscreen wiper switches; whether the driver had consumed any alcohol prior to the offence (provided the prejudicial value does not outweigh the evidential value of such evidence) and the mechanical condition of the vehicle.
N.B. A notice of intended prosecution is required for this offence if no accident occurs.
OBSTRUCTION
Regulation 103 Motor Vehicle (Construction and Use) Regulations 1986, and section 42 Road Traffic Act 1988
(A) POINTS TO PROVE
1.
That you
2.
being the person in charge
3.
of a certain motor vehicle (or trailer) namely a…
4.
did cause (or permit) that motor vehicle (or trailer)
5.
to stand on a road called…
6.
so as to cause an unnecessary obstruction thereof.
(B) MEANING OF TERMS
1.
‘That you ’ Means the identity of the person in charge.
2.
‘being the person in charge ’ Means that such a person generally has the keys for the vehicle, but in the vast majority of cases the person ‘in charge’will be the driver who parks the vehicle resulting in the obstruction.
3.
‘of a certain motor vehicle (or trailer)namely a…
’ See page 2 for motor vehicle and page 5 for trailer.
4.
did cause (or permit)that motor vehicle or trailer' -see glossary page 4.
5.
‘to stand on a road called…
‘Generally ‘to stand’ means to allow the motor vehicle (or trailer) to remain stationary and does not necessarily mean unattended (Hinde v Evans (1906) 70 JP 548) although this will normally be the case.
6.
‘so as to cause an unnecessary obstruction thereof ’.
The judges have taken the word ‘unnecessary’ to mean ‘unreasonable’, whether or not use amounting to an obstruction was or was not unreasonable use was a question of fact, depending on all the circumstances, including
(i)
the length of time the obstruction continued;
(ii)
the place where it occurred;
(iii)
the purpose for which it was done;
(iv)
whether it caused an actual as opposed to a potential obstruction as quoted in Evans v Barker [1971]RTR 453.
Commonplace obstructions include restricting the width of the road, blocking footpaths if they form part of the road and obstructing pedestrians and vehicles at ‘T’ junctions and other types of junctions etc.
Note that the Middlesex Crown Court case of Langham v Crisp [1975]Crim LR 652 where a motorist parked on one side of the road and an obstruction was caused by the subsequent parking of cars opposite.
It was held that when the  first vehicle parked it was not done so ‘as to cause’ an unnecessary obstruction.
(C) USUAL METHODS OF PROVING THESE POINTS
1.
‘That you ’ See (C) 1 of offence number 1.
2.
‘being the person in charge’ This point is usually proved by asking the person suspected of parking or causing the vehicle to be parked in the offending position ‘Are you responsible for this vehicle being left in this position?’
3.
‘of a certain motor vehicle (or trailer)namely a…
’ See (C) 3 of offence number 1.
4.
‘did cause (or permit)that motor vehicle (or trailer)’ See (C) 2 of offence number 5, although it is felt that ‘permit’in this offence means the continuing obstruction while ‘cause’deals with the positioning of the vehicle on the road.
(See (1975]Crim LR 653.)
5.
‘to stand on a road called…‘'To stand’ can be proved by the police officer who observed the vehicle stationary on a road.
For ‘road’ see (C) 4 of offence number 1.
6.
‘so as to cause an unnecessary obstruction thereof’.
This point can best be proved by a police officer who observes some actual unnecessary obstruction of the road causing other road users inconvenience, delay, or complete blockage of the road etc.
Such evidence is given by phrases including ‘I saw women with prams obstructed by the offending vehicle parking across a pavement’; ‘several motor cars had to negotiate carefully and slowly to pass the offending vehicle’ etc.
A sketch plan may assist the court where the obstruction is difficult to describe in words.
(D) SUPPORTING EVIDENCE
(a)
Note also the offence of leaving a vehicle on a road in a potentially dangerous position contrary to section 22 Road Traffic Act 1988.
Examples to show the difference from unnecessary obstruction include leaving a vehicle around a blind bend, or just over a humped-back bridge etc.
A notice of intended prosecution is required for this offence.
(b)
Note the offence of wilfully obstructing the free passage of a highway with anything, not just a vehicle, contrary to the Highways Act 1980, section 137.
This offence carries a power of arrest for a constable who witnesses the obstruction.
FAILING TO STOP AFTER AN ACCIDENT
Section 170 Road Traffic Act 1988
(A) POINTS TO PROVE
1.
That you
2.
being the driver
3.
of a certain mechanically propelled vehicle , namely…
4.
owing to the presence of which
5.
on a road called…
6.
an accident occurred whereby injury was caused to another person (or damage was caused to another vehicle or to an animal or to property)
7.
did fail to stop.
(B) MEANING OF TERMS
1.
‘That you’ Means the person driving the motor vehicle, i.e. his identity.
2.
‘being the driver ’ Driver means the person who takes the motor vehicle on the road and he continues to be the driver until the journey is finished, although he may have stopped and switched the  engine off some minutes before:Jones v Prothero [1952]1 All ER 434.
A person who has parked his car on a road and left it unattended can't be said to be the driver of this offence.
3.
‘of a certain mechanically propelled vehicle namely a…’
4.
‘owing to the presence of which’ This point means that there must be a direct connection between the motor vehicle and the occurrence of the accident:Quelch v Phipps [1955]2 A11 ER 302.
Therefore a passenger jumping off a moving bus and injuring himself would bring the motor vehicle within this section, but not generally where a driver has left his stationary motor vehicle parked on a road.
5.
‘on a road called…’
6.
‘an accident occurred whereby injury was caused to another person (or damage was caused to another vehicle or to an animal or to property)’
‘Accident’ means an unintended occurrence which has an adverse physical result (R v Morris [19721 A11 ER 384).
It can also include an accident resulting from a deliberate act (Chief Constable of West Midlands Police v Billingham [1979]Crim LR 256).
No other vehicle need be involved as where a person or animal or property is involved (R v Pico [1971]Crim LR 599).
‘Injury’ includes shock, or a hysterical and nervous condition (R v Miller [1954]2 All ER 529 and Hay (or Bourhill) v Young [1943]AC 92 (115 JP Jo 250)).
‘Another person’ means other than the driver, therefore where only the driver is injured this section is not applicable.
‘To…another vehicle’ means that damage must be caused to a vehicle other than the driver's motor vehicle.
Therefore where only the driver's motor vehicle is damaged the section  does not apply.
Note that this phrase applies to ‘another vehicle’ and not ‘another motor vehicle’.
‘Vehicle’ has been held to include a bicycle (Ellis v Nott-Bower (1896) 60 JP760).
‘Animal’ means horse, cattle, ass, mule, sheep, pig goat or dog.
Notable exceptions are cats and poultry.
‘Property’ means property growing in, constructed on, fixed to, or forming part of, the land adjacent to the road or on the road itself.
Therefore trees, crops, lamp-posts, traffic signs, walls etc. will generally be included in section 170.
7.
‘did fail to stop’, means did fail to stop immediately the accident happened and remain at the scene of the accident long enough, taking the prevailing conditions into account, to give his name and address and also the name and address of the owner and the identification marks of the vehicle (Lee v Knapp [1966]3 All ER 961 and Ward v Rawson [1979]Crim LR 58).
Two separate offences are created by section 170, namely (1) failing to stop and (2) failing to give particulars (Roper v Sullivan [1978]Crim LR 233).
If a motor vehicle is stationary when the accident occurs the driver must remain at the scene until he has satisfied the section.
But note that he need not wait indefinitely (Norling v Woolacott [1964]S ASR 377).
(C) USUAL METHODS OF PROVING THESE POINTS
1.
‘That you ’ See (C) 1 of offence number 1.
2.
‘being the driver ’ This point will be proved by a witness seeing the defendant driving away etc.
Where there are no witnesses or they cannot be traced, an admission by the defendant either verbally to the officer dealing with the case (who would record the admission in his pocket book or accident booklet) or in  writing if he chooses to make a ‘voluntary’ statement in accordance with the Codes of Practice.
Also see (C) 2 of offence number 1
3.
‘of certain mechanically propelled vehicle , namely…’
See (C) 3 of offence number 1.
4.
‘owing to the presence of which’ This point is normally covered in any witness statement that might be available, viz. ‘I saw four vehicles were involved etc.’or ‘if it had not been for that vehicle the accident would not have happened’.
Where witnesses are unavailable an admission to being involved is helpful.
5.
‘on a road called…
‘See (C) 4 of offence number 1
6.
‘an accident occurred whereby injury was caused to another person (or damage was caused to another vehicle or to an animal or to property)’.
This point is normally proved by the police officer examining the vehicles concerned or person, animal or property involved and recording the details of damage or injury in his pocket book or accident booklet.
Where a person is injured it is normal practice to take a statement to the effect that ‘the following injuries were sustained’.
In some cases of damage it might be wise to ascertain whether or not there was any similar damage prior to the accident.
In this way a defence that the property was already damaged and that the defendant is not responsible for the present damage can be countered.
7.
‘did fail to stop’.
It is rare for a police officer to witness such an event, therefore in most cases the evidence of passers-by or the driver of the other vehicle involved will have to be relied upon.
Obviously, the best kind of evidence in such cases is the evidence of ‘independent’ witnesses, i.e. a witness not  concerned with the parties involved in the accident.
Where the only evidence available is that of one party against the other, or a wife giving evidence for her husband, or an employee giving evidence for the employer etc. the court may well find the case not proved.
A good practical point to show, where possible, is that there was an interested party at the scene, had the defendant stopped
(D) SUPPORTING EVIDENCE
(a)
This offence was absolute, i.e. no mens rea was required.
But in Harding v Price [1948]1 All ER 283 it was held that if the driver did not know he had been involved in an accident the section did not apply.
Therefore in borderline cases the prosecution might have to rely on the severity of injury and damage, or the noise of the accident, to help prove to the court beyond all reasonable doubt that the driver must have realised that he had been involved in an accident.
An example would be where a large articulated motor vehicle was turning a sharp corner and in doing so had a slight collision with a parked car.
If the police could not prove that the accident was of such force and severity that the driver must have known of the accident, then the defence could put forward the saving in Harding v Price .
(b)
As section 170 creates two offences, if the defendant fails to stop but later reports the accident, or stops but refuses to give any particulars, an offence is committed per North v Cerish (1959) 123 JP 313.
DISQUALIFIED DRIVING
Section 103(1) (b) Road Traffic Act 1988
(A) POINTS TO PROVE
1.
That you
2.
being disqualified for holding or obtaining a licence to drive a motor vehicle (if of a certain class, state)
3.
drove a certain motor vehicle, namely a…(if of a certain class, state)
4.
on a road called…‘
(B) MEANING OF TERMS
1.
‘That you ’ Means the person driving the motor vehicle, i.e. identify the driver.
2.
‘being disqualified for holding or obtaining a licence to drive a motor vehicle’ Disqualification means that the person disqualified must not, in Great Britain, drive on a road any motor vehicle.
3.
‘did drive a certain motor vehicle , namely a…’
4.
‘on a road called…’
(C) USUAL METHODS OF PROVING THESE POINTS
1.
‘That you ’ See (C) 1 of offence number 1.
2.
‘being disqualified for holding or obtaining a licence to drive a motor vehicle’
Proof of disqualification may be certificate of conviction or extract from the magistrates' court register together with proof of identification of the defendant, e.g. by the police officer who was present in court when the defendant was disqualified.
This procedure varies according to local practice and enquiries regarding the best method of proof are advised.
A person disqualified by reason of age, i.e. being too young to drive the particular class of vehicle, comes under this offence and age can be proved by a birth certificate or a statement from a person present at the birth in difficult cases.
3.
did drive a certain motor vehicle , namely a…’
See (C) 2 and 3 of offence number 1.
4.
‘on a road called…’
See (C) 4 of offence number 1.
(D) SUPPORTING EVIDENCE
Where a defendant states that he did not know that he was disqualified this will not amount to a defence Taylor v Kenyon [1952]2 All ER 726.
Problems related to the identity of the driver occur quite frequently with this offence.
A police officer may see a person driving a motor vehicle, who he knows to be disqualified but is not in a position to stop the driver.
When eventually interviewed regarding the suspected offence there could well be a denial and whilst not essential, the prosecution case would be much stronger if corroboration is available regarding the driver's identity.
USING ETC.
WITHOUT INSURANCE
Section 143 Road Traffic Act 1988

5.
there not being in force in relation to the use of that vehicle
6.

(B) MEANING OF TERMS
1.
‘That you ’ Means the person using, causing or permitting the use of the motor vehicle i.e. identify the offender.
2.
‘did use (or cause, or permit …to use)’
3.
‘a motor vehicle , namely a…‘
4.
‘on a road called…‘
5.
’ there not being in force in relation to the use of that vehicle ‘This phrase means that there is no insurance cover in force relating to the use of the vehicle as opposed to insurance covering the contents for example.
6.
‘such a policy of insurance or security’ A policy is of no effect until the certificate is delivered to the assured (section 147 (1) Road Traffic Act 1988).
The policy is the contractual document setting out the terms and conditions of the insurance agreement which appear in various paragraphs which are usually called clauses.
7.
‘in respect of third party risks as complies with the requirements of Part VI Road Traffic Act 1988’.
Section 145 Road Traffic Act 1988 sets out the requirements for third part risks as follows:
(2)
The policy must be issued by an authorised insurer.
(3)
Subject to subsection (4) below, the policy
(a)
must insure such person, persons or classes of persons as may be specified in the policy in respect of any liability which may be incurred by him or them in respect of the death of or bodily injury to any person caused by, or arising out of, the use of the vehicle on a road in Great Britain; and
(b)
must insure him or them in respect of any liability which may be incurred by him or them m respect of the use of the vehicle and of any trailer, whether or not coupled, in the territory other than Great Britain and Gibraltar of each of the member states of the Communities according to the law on compulsory insurance against civil liability in respect of the use of vehicles of the state where the liability may be incurred; and
(c)
must also insure him or them in respect of any  liability which may be incurred by him or them under the provisions of this Part of this Act relating to payment for emergency treatment.
(4)
The policy shall not by virtue of subsection (3)(a) above, be required to cover (a) liability in respect of the death, arising out of and in the course of his employment, of a person in the employment of a person insured by the policy or of bodily injury sustained by such a person arising out of and in the course of his employment; or other such matters.
(See section for full list.)’
(C) USUAL METHODS OF PROVING THESE POINTS
1.
‘That you ’ See (C) I of offence number 1.
2.
‘did use (or cause, or permit …to use)’ 'Use' is generally proved by the observation of the police officer to the effect ‘I stopped the motor vehicle…which was being driven in Queens Street and spoke to the driver…
A few offences of this nature will involve the owner of the vehicle or employer of the driver.
For example the owner of a motor vehicle can be said to use it where he sits at the side of the driver, who is not his employee and the vehicle is being used for his purpose (Cobb v Williams [1973]RTR 1 13).
An employer uses the vehicle even when he is not present in it, when it is being used on his business, with his permission.
Therefore, where the driver is accompanied by the owner, or the motor vehicle is being used on firm's business, the driver and the owner or employer all ‘use’.
Where the owner is present in the vehicle the police officer's statement will include an admission as to the vehicle's  ownership e.g. ‘Are you the owner of this vehicle?’ and the passenger replies ‘Yes’.
In cases involving an employer he will probably have to be interviewed later.
Questions such as‘Are you the Company Secretary or owner of…firm?’;
‘Is your firm the owner of motor vehicle…?’ and ‘Was it being used on firm's business at…(time)…in…(place)…?’, need affirmative answers.
He can then be cautioned and reported for the ‘using’ offence.
Note that a person does not use a vehicle without insurance unless there is an element of controlling, managing and operating the vehicle.
‘Cause’ can be proved by questions and answers or by instructions written on a job-sheet etc.
Knowledge of the facts amounting to the unlawful use must be shown in the statement of evidence.
The driver may be forthcoming that his boss said words to the effect that he knew there was no insurance but the vehicle was the only one available and the journey had to be undertaken.
It has been held that towing a vehicle is ‘causing’ it to be used (Milstead v Sexton [1964]Crim LR 474),
‘Permit’ is not as precise a term as ‘cause’and denotes an express or inferred permission of a general or particular type.
Again the prosecution must rely on what the driver tells them or on written instructions and, in rare cases, on admissions by the employer.
‘Use’ is to be preferred as a charge on the grounds that it is easier to prove, being a clearly defined term, and attracts less defences than ‘cause’and ‘permits’.
3.
‘a motor vehicle , namely a…
‘See (C) 3 of offence number 1.
4.
‘on a road called…
‘See (C) 4 of offence number 1.
5.
’ there not being in force in relation to the use of that vehicle ‘The proof of insurance falls to the defence once it has been established by the prosecution that the motor vehicle has been used on a road (Philcox v Carberry [1960]Crim LR 563).
While the onus is on the defence, most police officers’ statements contain the question ‘Are you insured to drive this motor vehicle?’
In the cases where an expired insurance certificate is produced a question such as‘have you any other insurance for this motor vehicle?’ is advisable.
6.
‘such a policy of insurance or security’ The prosecution must show that the insurance, if any is produced, does not conform to the requirements of section 143, Road Traffic Act 1988, as section 147 (1) of that Act requires that for a policy to be effective, the insurers must deliver a certificate in the prescribed form to the assured.
The courts recognise the insurance certificate as evidence of being insured.
Therefore the police generally require to see the certificate to satisfy themselves that the motor vehicle is correctly insured but in some cases of doubt the policy may have to be examined or enquiries made of the issuing firm.
Evidence of insufficient cover might include someone other than the insured person driving the vehicle; the vehicle being used for the purpose other than agreed, e.g. for business purposes; or the present vehicle not being entered on the firm's records (this being difficult to detect in these days of not generally showing a registered number on a certificate).
7.
‘in respect of third party risks as complies with the requirements of Part VI, Road Traffic Act 1988’.
The police officer will normally accept the information on the insurance certificate at face value and if the certificate shows ‘comprehensive’ cover, this automatically includes ‘third party risks’.
In a large number of cases the cover will be restricted to ‘third party’ only which is still within the  requirements of section 145 above, at (B) 7.
(D) SUPPORTING EVIDENCE
(a)
When a certificate of insurance has expired or when a new insurance contract is being negotiated, insurance companies issue ‘cover notes’ which usually vary in length of validity from 15 days to 60 days.
(b)
For a cover note to be valid the defendant must accept the cover note and rely upon it for his insurance cover.
If he disregards it because he intends to insure with another firm, for example, and never pays the original firm, the cover note will not be valid (Taylor v Allon [1965]1 All ER 557).
(c)
As with numerous other offences dealing with road traffic the use of a motor vehicle without insurance is an absolute offence, i.e. no guilty knowledge is required.
(d)
Occasionally when an employee is found to be driving whilst uninsured on his employer's business he can put forward a defence where he shows —
(i)
the vehicle did not belong to him; and
(ii)
was not in his possession under a contract of hiring or loan; and
(iii)
that he neither knew nor had reason to believe he was driving without insurance.
The employer could still commit the offence of using, causing or permitting no insurance.
USING ETC.
WITHOUT A TEST CERTIFICATE
Section 47 (1) Road Traffic Act 1988
5 (A) POINTS TO PROVE
1.
That you
2.
did use (or cause, or permit to be used)
3.
on a road called…
4.
a motor vehicle, namely a…(specify type of motor vehicle) to which section 47 of the Road Traffic Act 1988, applied and
5,
in respect of which  no test certificate had been issued within 12 months prior to…day of…19
(B) MEANING OF TERMS
1.
‘That you ’ Means the person using or permitting the use of the motor vehicle i.e. identify the driver etc.
2.
‘did use (or cause, or permit to be used)’
3.
‘on a road called…’
4.
‘a motor vehicle , namely a…to which section 47 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 applied and’ Section 47 applies to all motor vehicles first used more than three years before the time at which it is proved to have been actually used on the road for the purpose of the present offence.
The Motor Vehicles (Tests) regulations 1981 exempt among other motor vehicles most public service vehicles; goods vehicles of an unladen weight exceeding 1525 kg (about 30 cwts)(other than dual purpose vehicles); articulated vehicles; when submitting a vehicle for a test after prior arrangement or bringing it away; where a test certificate is refused — taking it for repair by prior arrangement or bringing it away and also taking it, by towing to be broken up, and motor traders when repairing motor vehicles etc.
5.
‘in respect of which no test certificate had been issued within 12 months prior to…day of…19…
This phrase means that there was no current test certificate in force for the motor vehicle.
A test certificate is valid for 12 months.
(C) USUAL METHODS OF PROVING THESE POINTS
1.
‘That you ’ See (C) 1 of offence number 1.
2.
‘did use (or cause, or permit to be used)’
3.
‘on a road called…
4.
‘a motor vehicle , namely a…to which section 47 of the Road Traffic Act 1988, applied and’ See (C) 3 of offence number 1 for ‘motor vehicle’.
Proof that the motor vehicle required a test certificate is often overlooked.
The vast majority of this kind of offence will be concerned with motor cars, but whenever the vehicle is of an unusual type the exemptions to the requirements must be carefully checked.
Once it has been established that the vehicle or its use is not exempt the type of motor vehicle should be described in the police officer's statement.
The second requirement is that the date of first registration is more than three years from the date of the suspected offence.
Normally this point is proved by the officer in the case examining the registration document and including in his statement a passage such as‘On examining the vehicle's registration document I saw the date of first registration was…’
If the registration document is lost, or at the DVLC, Swansea, then proof can be requested from the DVLC.
5.
‘in respect of which no test certificate had been issued within 12 months prior to…day of…19…’
As with other documents which can be obtained at a large number of different places, the onus to show that the vehicle had a current test certificate rests on the defendant.
An expired certificate might be produced.
The particulars should be entered in the police officer's pocket book and followed by a question such as‘Have you any other test certificate for this motor vehicle?’
The driver might admit he hasn't a current certificate and the relevant conversation can be reproduced in the officer's statement of evidence.
(D) SUPPORTING EVIDENCE
If a police officer has to request a driver to produce a  current test certificate, the officer must bear in mind the problem of proving the date of first registration.
If a form HO/RT/1 is issues and the driver elects to produce the document at a distant police station it is good practice to also request the suspected driver to produce his registration document at the same time.
In this way the officer accepting the production can also prove the date of first registration if need be by personal appearance.
NO CRASH HELMET
Regulation 4 (1) Motor Cycles (Protective Helmets) Regulations 1980 and Section 16 Road Traffic Act 1988
(A) POINTS TO PROVE
1.
That you
2.
did drive (or ride on)
3.
a certain motor bicycle, namely a…
4.
on a road called…
5.
without protective headgear.
(B) MEANING OF TERMS
1.
‘That you ’ Means the person driving or riding on the motor bicycle, i.e. the identity.
2.
‘did drive (or ride on)‘Or ride on’ includes any pillion passenger, but not passengers in any sidecar per regulation 3 (1) of the above regulations.
3.
‘a certain motor bicycle, namely a…
‘Means a two wheeled motor cycle, whether having a sidecar attached thereto or not, and for the purposes of this definition any wheels of a motor cycle shall, if the distance between the centres of the areas of contact between such wheels and the road surface is less than 460 millimetres, be counted as one wheel; per regulation 4 (3) Motor Cycles (Protective Helmets) Regulations 1980.
A mowing machine  coming within the definition of a motor bicycle is exempt.
The offence does not include propelling the motor bicycle by a person on foot.
4.
‘on a road called…’
5.
‘without protective headgear’.
‘Without’ could mean either no headgear at all or a headgear which is not ‘protective headgear’as defined: ‘protective headgear’means headgear which
(a)
is either —
(i)
a helmet bearing a marking applied by the manufacturer indicating compliance with the specification contained in one of the British Standards mentioned in Schedule 2 (whether or not as modified by any amendment); or
(ii)
a helmet of a type manufactured for use by persons on motor cycles which by virtue of its shape, material and construction could reasonably be expected to afford to persons on motor bicycles a degree of protection from injury in the event of an accident similar to or greater than that provided by the helmet of a type complying with one of the specifications referred to in the preceding subparagraph; and
(b)
if worn with a chin cup attached to or held in position by a strap or other fastening provided on the helmet, is provided with an additional strap or other fastening (to be fastened under the wearer's jaw) for securing the helmet firmly to the head of the wearer; and
(c)
is securely fastened to the head of the wearer by means of the straps or other fastening provided on the headgear for that purpose.
(C) USUAL METHODS OF PROVING THESE POINTS
1.
‘That you’ can be proved as (C) I of offence 1.
2.
‘did drive (or ride on)’ See (C) 2 of offence number 1 for ‘drive’.
‘Ride on’ can be proved by the police officer or witness who saw the offence.
3.
‘a certain motor bicycle, namely a…’
In the vast majority of cases the offender(s) will be on a solo motor bicycle, and occasionally one having a sidecar attached.
This fact can be mentioned in the police officer's statement of evidence if he witnessed the offence.
4.
‘on a road called…’
See (C) 4 of offence number 1.
5.
‘without protective headgear’.
This point can be proved by the police officer's observations that the person on the motor bicycle had no headgear or the headgear he was wearing did not come within the legal requirements.
Where it is suspected that headgear is below the British Standard the assistance of a Forensic Science Laboratory could be sought.
If the securing straps are not within the legal requirements a full description will be necessary.
(D) SUPPORTING EVIDENCE
The 1980 Regulations provides the following exemption.
A requirement imposed by regulations shall not apply to any follower of the Sikh religion while he is wearing a turban.
NO VEHICLE EXCISE LICENCE
Section 8 Vehicles (Excise) Act 1971
(A) POINTS TO PROVE
1.
That you
2.
did use (or keep)
3.
a mechanically propelled vehicle, namely a…
4.
on a public road called…
5.
for which a licence was not in force.
(B) MEANING OF TERMS
1.
‘That you ’ Means the person using or keeping the motor vehicle i.e. their identity.
2.
‘did use (or keep)’ A person ‘keeps’a vehicle if he causes it to be stationary on a road when not in use.
The shortness of the period of time it is left on the road is immaterial (Holliday v Henry [1974]RTR 101).
3.
‘a mechanically propelled vehicle, namely a…’
Means propelled by petrol, oil, steam or electric etc.
A vehicle ceases to be mechanically propelled when there is no reasonable prospect of it ever being mobile again (Binks v Department of the Environment [1975]RTR 318).
Certain vehicles are exempt from duty under various legislation.
Exemptions likely to be encountered include vehicles not exceeding 10 cwt unladen specially adapted for invalids; vehicles brought from abroad for a temporary stay are exempt not exceeding one year from date of importation; vehicles going to or returning from a vehicle test or being repaired etc. as a result of the test, provided in all cases prior arrangements have been made.
Lists of exemptions can be found in sections 4, 5, 6 & 7 of the Vehicles (Excise) Act 1971.
4.
‘on a public road called…’ 'Public road' means ‘a road which is repairable at the public expense’per section 38 (1) Vehicles (Excise) Act 1971.
5.
‘for which a licence was not in force’.
This phrase means that there was no current vehicle excise licence in force and this point can be verified by making enquiries at the DVLC, Swansea.
A licence is void from the time it was granted where the payment was by a cheque which was eventually dishonoured (Customs and Excise Management Act).
(C) USUAL METHODS OF PROVING THESE POINTS
1.
‘That you ’ See (C) 1 of offence number 1.
2.
‘did use (or keep)’ 'Use' is usually proved by the police officer in the case giving evidence that he saw the defendant driving the motor vehicle in question.
Traffic wardens can also become involved with this offence by detecting a vehicle not displaying a current excise licence.
Where subsequent enquiries show the vehicle to be unlicensed the traffic warden would be able to prove use.
Similarly, where a vehicle is seen stationary and unattended, the offence of ‘keeping’ can be considered.
The officer who saw the vehicle being kept should be in a position to state the length of time he observed the vehicle being kept on a public road, but see (B) 2 of this offence regarding the length of time kept being immaterial.
Proof of ownership is not required to establish who ‘used’ or ‘kept’the vehicle, but it is advisable that the prosecution should know the owner of the vehicle.
An employer is liable for the offence of ‘using’ an unlicensed vehicle if the vehicle is driven on his business and it is no defence for the employer to show that he had not authorised the journey if, in fact, the journey was on his business (Richardson v Baker [1976]RTR 56).
The burden of proof regarding the purpose the vehicle was used lies on the defence — section 33 Vehicles (Excise) Act 1971.
3.
‘a mechanically propelled vehicle, namely a…’
This point is proved by describing the vehicle concerned and making sure it does not come with the many exemptions.
‘Mechanically propelled vehicle’ does not mean the same as ‘Motor vehicle’as defined in the glossary at page 2.
For the purposes of the Vehicle (Excise) Act the vehicle need not be intended or adapted for use on a road.
In cases  of difficulty the test as mentioned at (B) 3 of the offence, i.e. will the vehicle ever be mobile again, might help in cases where parts have been taken off a vehicle.
4.
‘on a public road called…’
No offence against section 8 of the Vehicles (Excise) Act 1971 is committed where the vehicle is used or kept on a private road, i.e. a road which is not repairable at public expense.
The highways department of the local authority will be able to prove which roads are repairable at public expense where necessary.
5.
‘for which a licence was not in force’.
This point can be proved by an admission on the part of the defendant-on enquiries at the DVLC, Swansea whose records can be produced in evidence; and by an admission on the part of the owner where he isn't the defendant etc.
(D) SUPPORTING EVIDENCE
It has been said in the case of Carpenter v Campbell [1953]1 All ER.
280 that it may be an oppressive course to prosecute the driver of an unlicensed vehicle in a master-servant relationship, where the driver is the employee and not responsible for licensing the vehicle.
MISUSE OF A TRADE LICENCE (OR TRADE PLATES)
Regulations 35 Road Vehicles (Registration and Licensing) Regulations 1971 and sections 12 and 16 Vehicles (Excise) Act 1971
(A) POINTS TO PROVE
1.
That you being the holder of a trade licence (or licences) issued under section 16, Vehicles (Excise) Act 1971
2.
used by virtue of that (or those) licence (or licences)
3.
on a public road called…
4.
a vehicle, namely a…
5.
for a  purpose other than a purpose prescribed under section 16 (2), Vehicles (Excise) Act 1971 (specify purpose).
(B) MEANING OF TERMS
1.
‘That you being the holder of a trade licence issued under section 16, Vehicles (Excise) Act 1971’ This means that the defendant must be the person to whom the trade licence was issued.
In a large number of cases the licence is issued to a firm, i.e. a limited company, then the company secretary is liable for the misuse of the trade plate on behalf of the company.
The holder of the licence must be a motor trader, vehicle tester or vehicle manufacturer.
His identity must be proved.
2.
‘used by virtue of that licence’ In other words the vehicle concerned must have been used under the trade licence and not under a normal vehicle excise licence for an offence to contravene the law relating to trade licences.
3.
‘on a public road called…’
See (B) 4 of offence number 8.
4.
‘a vehicle , namely a…’
See (B) 3 of offence number 8 for vehicles concerned.
5.
‘for the purpose other than a purpose prescribed under section 16 (2), Vehicles (Registration and Licensing) Regulations 1971.’
Namely in the Road Vehicles (Registration and Licensing) Regulations 1971 Regulation 35
(1)
In this regulation, ‘business purpose’, in relation to a motor trader means —
(a)
a purpose connected with his business as a manufacturer  or repairer of or dealer in mechanically propelled vehicles; or
(b)
a purpose connected with his business as a manufacturer or repairer of or dealer in trailers carried on in conjunction with his business as a motor trader.
(2)
For the purposes of sub-paragraph (a) to (k) of paragraph (4) of this regulation, where a mechanically propelled vehicle is used on a public road by virtue of a trade licence and that vehicle is drawing a trailer, the vehicle and trailer shall be deemed to constitute a single vehicle.
(3)
Save as provided in regulation 36 of these regulations, no person, being a motor trader and the holder of a trade vehicle, shall use any mechanically propelled vehicle on a public road by virtue of that licence unless it is a vehicle which is temporarily in his possession in the course of his business as a motor trader or a recovery vehicle kept by him for the purpose of dealing with disabled vehicles in the course of that business.
(4)
Save as provided in the said regulation 36 and without derogation from the provisions of the last preceding paragraph of this regulation, no person, being a motor trader and the holder of a trade licence, shall use any mechanically propelled vehicle on a public road by virtue of that licence for a purpose other than a business purpose and other than one of the following purposes:
(a)
for its test or trial or the test or trial of its accessories or equipment in the ordinary course of construction or repair or after completion in either such case;
(b)
for proceeding to or from a public weighbridge for ascertaining its unladen weight or to or from any place for its registration or inspection by a person acting on behalf of the Secretary of State;
(c)
for its test or trial for the benefit of a prospective purchaser, for proceeding at the instance of a prospective purchaser to any place for the purpose of such test or trial, or for returning after such test or trial;
(d)
for its test or trial for the benefit of a person interested  in promoting publicity in regard to it, for proceeding at the instance of such a person to any place for the purpose of such test or trial, or for returning after such test or trial;
(e)
for delivering it to the place where the purchaser intends to keep it;
(f)
for demonstrating its operation or the operation of its accessories or equipment when being handed over to the purchaser;
(g)
for delivering it from one part of his premises to another part of his premises, or for delivering it from his premises to the premises of, or between parts of premises of, another manufacturer or repairer of or dealer in mechanically propelled vehicles or removing it from the premises of another manufacturer or repairer of or dealer in mechanically propelled vehicles direct to his own premises;
(h)
for proceeding to or returning from a workshop in which a body or a special type of equipment or accessory is to be or has been fitted to it or in which it is to be or has been painted, valeted or repaired;
(i)
for proceeding from the premises of a manufacturer or repairer of or dealer in mechanically propelled vehicles to a place from which it is to be transported by train, ship or aircraft or for proceeding to the premises of such a manufacturer, repairer or dealer from a place to which it has been so transported;
(j)
for proceeding to or returning from any garage, auction room or other place at which vehicles are usually stored or usually or periodically offered for sale and at which the vehicle is to be or has been stored or is to be or has been offered for sale as the case may be;
(k)
for proceeding to or returning from a place where it is to be or has been tested, or for proceeding to a place where it is to be broken up or otherwise dismantled.
(C) USUAL METHODS OF PROVING THESE POINTS
1.
‘that you being the holder of a trade licence issued under section 16, Vehicles (Excise) Act 1971 ‘Has a slightly different meaning than the offence where the driver is required to be identified.
In this case the prosecution must prove that the person who has been summonsed is the holder of the trade licence.
In some cases he will be the driver of the vehicle.
It can be proved that he was the holder by examining the trade licence itself for the defendant's name, by an admission from the defendant and by checking with the issuing authority.
2.
‘used by virtue of that licence’ This point can be proved by asking the trade licence holder ‘was (or is) this vehicle being used under this trade licence?’
If the vehicle is driven by an employee who is not to be summonsed for any offence, a statement should be requested as he should be dealt with as a witness.
He should be asked to mention in his statement the fact that the vehicle was being used by virtue of the trade licence.
3.
‘on a public road called…’
The comments made at offence number 8 at (C) 4 apply, i.e. the road must be repairable at public expense.
4.
‘a vehicle , namely a…’
As excise duty is the subject matter of this offence the same vehicles that are exempt vehicles excise licences are also exempt the necessity for a trade licence, therefore refer to offence 8 (C) 3 for more information.
5.
‘for a purpose other than a purpose prescribed under section 16(2) Vehicles (Excise) Act 1971’.
The purpose is proved by question and answer if the defendant is driving or if he has to be interviewed later by a police officer.
A statement from any employee who could help prove this point would be valuable for the prosecution, especially if it is suspected the defence will deny the alleged purpose.
The garage foreman who perhaps sent the employee driver on the journey could be asked to provide a statement.
Illegal uses often include shopping trips, collecting spare parts for the garage or calling at a public house along a journey.
Each use will present its own problems of proof and it is impossible to lay down any hard and fast rules.
(D) SUPPORTING EVIDENCE
Where the prosecution allege a contravention of the trade plate law there will probably be the further offence of ‘no vehicle excise licence’(Offence number 8 ante ).
WINDSCREEN WASHERS NOT FITTED OR WORKING
Regulation 34(2) Motor Vehicles (Construction and Use) Regulations 1986 and section 42 Road Traffic Act 1988
(A) POINTS TO PROVE

4.
a motor vehicle namely a…
5.
which was required to be fitted with windscreen wipers
6.
which was not fitted with windscreen washers capable of cleaning in conjunction with those wipers the area of windscreen swept by the wipers.
(B) MEANING OF TERMS
1.
‘That you ’ Means the user's etc. identity.
2.
‘did use (or cause, or permit to be used)’
3.
‘on a road called…’
4.
‘a motor vehicle namely a…’
5.
‘which was required to be fitted with windscreen wipers-This point means that regulation 34(1) of the above regulations  requires every vehicle which is fitted with a windscreen to be fitted with one or more wipers.
One exception to this requirement is when a view to the front can be obtained without first looking through the windscreen.
e.g. by opening or looking over it.
6.
‘which was not fitted with windscreen washers capable of cleaning in conjunction with those wipers the area of windscreen swept by the wipers’.
This point means that where a motor vehicle is required to be fitted with wipers it must also have washers.
The washers must be correctly aligned, filled with fluid and be otherwise correctly maintained, so as to be capable of cleaning in conjunction with the wipers.
(C) USUAL METHODS OF PROVING THESE POINTS
1.
‘That you ‘See (C) I of offence number 1.
2.
‘did use (or cause, or permit to be used)’ See (C) 2 of offence number 5 and (C) 2 of offence number 19.

See (C) 4 of offence number 1.
4.
‘a motor vehicle namely a…
See (C) 3 of offence number 1.
5.
‘which was required to be fitted with windscreen wipers’ This point is proved by showing there was no view to the front without first looking through the windscreen.
This point is usually included in the police officer's statement of evidence, e.g. ‘The driver could not get a view to the front without first looking through the windscreen’.
6.
‘which was not fitted with windscreen washers capable of cleaning in conjunction with those wipers the area of windscreen swept by the wipers’.
This point can be proved by showing in the police officer's  evidence the actual situation regarding washers, i.e. whether any washers were fitted; if fitted, whether there was any fluid in the reservoir; or whether the jets were correctly adjusted etc.
The main point to show is that the washers were not capable of cleaning as required.

‘a vehicle namely a…’
The term is wider than motor vehicle and has been held to include a bicycle
4.
‘which carries obligatory lamps’ 'Obligatory lamps', in relation to a vehicle, means such of the obligatory front lamps, obligatory headlamps and obligatory rear lamps as the vehicle is required, by virtue of the Road Vehicles Lighting Regulations, to carry when on a road during the hours of darkness (as defined by the Road Vehicles Lighting Regulations).
5.
‘on a road called’
6.
‘during daytime hours without the lamps being lit while the vehicle was in motion  ‘During daytime hours’ means the time between half-an-hour before sunrise and half-an-hour after sunset.
‘Without the lamps being lit’ is self explanatory.
It is thought that this means all must be working to comply with this regulation.
‘While the vehicle was in motion’ means that the vehicle must be moving either backwards or forwards and that these regulations do not apply when the vehicle is stationary.
7.
‘during a period of seriously reduced visibility conditions on that road’.
‘Seriously reduced visibility conditions’ in relation to a vehicle used on a road during daytime hours may include such conditions adversely affecting visibility (whether consisting of, or including, fog, smoke, heavy rain or spray, snow, dense cloud, or any similar condition) as seriously reduce the ability of the driver (after the appropriate use by him of any windscreen wiper and washer) to see other vehicles or persons on the road, or the ability of other users of the road to see the vehicle.
(C) USUAL METHODS OF PROVING THESE POINTS
1.
‘That you ’ See (C) I of offence number 1.
2.
‘did use ’ See (C) 2 of offence number 5.
3.
‘a vehicle namely a…’ 'Vehicle' is proved by describing it in a prosecution witness's statement.
4.
‘which carried obligatory lamps’ can be proved by describing which obligatory lamps it carried in a witness's statement.
5.
‘on a road called…’
See (C) 4 of offence number 1.
6.
‘during daytime hours without the lamps being lit while the vehicle was in motion’ The daytime hours can be proved by reference to an almanac or from a witness's observations if this is found necessary.
The lamps not being lit and the motion of the vehicle can be proved by the observations of a prosecution witness, i.e. usually the constable who reports the offender for summons e.g. ‘The vehicle's obligatory lights were not lit and the vehicle was in motion on the road’.
7.
‘during a period of seriously reduced visibility conditions on that road’.
Can be proved by describing the conditions according to the definition at (B) 7 of this offence.
This is a question of fact for the court to decide and therefore it is essential for the prosecution to show that the conditions seriously reduced the ability of the driver to see other vehicles etc.
The offending driver may occasionally admit this fact but failing that the poor visibility must be proved.
(D) SUPPORTING EVIDENCE
Where a headlamp is capable of emitting a dipped beam and a full or mainbeam then either beam would be sufficient.
A matched pair of front fog lamps can be substituted for headlamps in conditions of fog or falling snow.
FAIL TO COMPLY WITH CONSTABLE'S OR WARDEN'S SIGNAL
Section 35(1) Road Traffic Act 1988
(A) POINTS TO PROVE
1.
That you
2.
being the person driving (or propelling)
3,
a vehicle, namely a…
4.
where a police constable (or a traffic warden) was for the time being engaged in the regulation of traffic
5.
on a road called…
6.
did neglect (or  refuse) to stop the vehicle (or to make the vehicle proceed in a particular line of traffic or to make the vehicle keep to a particular line of traffic or to proceed to a particular point)
7.
when directed so to do by the police constable (or the traffic warden) in the execution of his duty.
(B) MEANING OF TERMS
1.
‘That you ’ Means the identity of the person driving or propelling the vehicle.
2.
‘being the person driving (or propelling)’ 'Propelling' means that vehicles other than mechanically propelled are included, such as pedal cycles.
3.
‘a vehicle , namely a…’
4.
‘where a police constable (or a traffic warden) was for the time being engaged in the regulation of traffic’ This offence cannot be committed where the constable or traffic warden are not engaged in the regulation of traffic.
This duty is derived from the constable's common law duty to act in protection of life and property.
Therefore, refusing to proceed to a census point (or a traffic survey being carried out on or in the vicinity of a road) is now an offence under this section.
5.
‘on a road called…’
6.
‘did neglect (or refuse) to stop the vehicle (or to make the vehicle proceed in a particular line of traffic or to make the vehicle keep to a particular line of traffic or to proceed to a particular point)’ This phrase means:
(a)
‘neglect to stop’ caters for cases where the driver does not see the constable's signal.
It appears from the case decisions on this point that if the court feels that the driver should have seen the signal then the offence will be committed;
(b)
‘refuse to stop’ is straightforward refusal when such conduct can be proved;
(c)
‘stop’ apparently means to stop and remain stationary until signalled to move;
(d)
‘proceed in a particular line of traffic’ means e.g. to signal the driver etc., to join a line of traffic
(e)
‘keep to a particular line’ means e.g. to continue in the line in which he is already travelling;
(f)
‘proceed to a particular point’ means e.g. to signal the driver to go from A to B or start a particular line of traffic etc.
7.
‘when directed to do so by the police constable (or the traffic warden) in the execution of his duty’.
He should be acting with a view to protecting life or property as point 4 of this offence.
The direction or signal by the officer should be given clearly and in sufficient time for the defendant to stop.
It has been held that a signal which was given with a lamp at night and which the driver failed to understand was not sufficient for failing to stop.
(C) USUAL METHOD OF PROVING THESE POINTS
1.
‘That you ’ See (C) 1 of offence number 1.
2.
‘being the person driving (or propelling)’ See (C) 2 of offence number 1.
3.
‘a vehicle , namely a…’
Vehicle is proved by describing it in a witness's statement.
4.
‘where a police constable (or a traffic warden) was for the time being engaged in the regulation of traffic’ This point is proved by stating so in the constable's or warden's statement of evidence, e.g. ‘I was engaged in the regulation of traffic to allow pedestrians to cross safely’.
5.
‘on a road called…’
See (C) 4 of offence number 1.
6.
‘did neglect (or refuse) to stop the vehicle (or to make the vehicle proceed in a particular line of traffic or to make the vehicle keep to a particular line of traffic or to proceed to a particular point)’ The proving of this phrase will depend on the circumstances of each case.
if there is an obvious refusal to stop the vehicle the officer should show this in his statement.
The fact that he did not stop can be explained or whichever part of this point is applicable.
If more than one officer or warden witnessed the incident it might save argument in court if a corroborative statement was made by the other witness.
7.
‘when directed so to do by the police constable or the traffic warden) in the execution of his duty’.
This point is proved by the officer or warden describing how visible he was to the driver, e.g. ‘I was clearly visible to a driver approaching the crossroads etc…
Visibility was good, the weather was fine and the sun was not shining etc.’
The officer/warden should then describe his signal in detail.
The execution of his duty is proved as at point 4 above.
(D) SUPPORTING EVIDENCE
Note that the vehicle need not be on a road at the time of the offence.
The section only requires that the constable or warden should be on a road and a driver entering a road from a private drive in contravention of a constable's signal under this section could commit an offence.
Also note that under this.section the constable need not be in uniform compared with section 163 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 which deals with the general power to stop vehicles.
A notice of intended prosecution is required.
DRIVING WITHOUT A LICENCE
Section 87 Road Traffic Act 1988
(A) POINTS TO PROVE
1.
That you
2.
did drive
3.
a motor vehicle, namely a…
4.
on a road called…
5.
when you were not the holder
6.
of a licence authorising you to drive a vehicle of that class.
(B) MEANING OF TERMS
1.
‘That you ’ Means the person driving the motor vehicle, ie. his identity.
2.
‘did drive ’
3.
‘a motor vehicle , namely a…’
4.
‘on a road called…‘
5.
‘when you were not the holder’ This was once difficult for the prosecution to prove as there were numerous local taxation offices which issued driving licences.
Therefore the use of the so-called ‘negative averment’ was required.
In practice it would be almost impossible to disprove a claim by the defendant that he had a licence but had lost it and had forgotten from which local taxation office it had been issued.
In such a case where the true facts can only be known by the defence the prosecution could aver that the driver was unlicensed.
Since the DVLC at Swansea became responsible for driving licences the use of the negative averment for driving licences has ended but could still be used for certificates of insurance and test certificates etc.
6.
‘of a licence authorising you to drive a vehicle of that class’.
‘Class’ of vehicle shall be construed as reference to a class defined or described by reference to any characteristics of the vehicles or to any other circumstances whatsoever (section 192(3) Road Traffic Act 1988).
(C) USUAL METHODS OF PROVING POINTS
1.
‘That you ’ See (C) 1 of offence number l.
2.
‘did drive ’ See (C) 2 of offence number l.
3.
‘a motor vehicle namely a…’
See (C) 3 of offence number l.
4.
‘on a road called…’
See (C) 4 of offence number 1.
5.
‘when you were not the holder’ In most cases the suspected driver will either say he has no licence or he will elect to produce a licence and fail to do so.
Therefore, questions put to the defendant such as‘Have you ever passed a Ministry of Transport test for this class of vehicle?’ and/or ‘Do you hold or have you ever held a driving licence for this class of vehicle?’should prove useful.
Note the use of a ‘negative averment’ as at (B) 5 of this offence.
6.
‘of a licence authorising you to drive a vehicle of that class’.
In nine times out of ten the vehicle concerned will be a motor bike or a motor car.
But it is important to be able to classify the different types of mechanically propelled vehicles in order to be able to prove to a court in which class a vehicle falls.
(D) SUPPORTING EVIDENCE
(a)
The majority of offenders against this offence say that they forgot to renew their licence, which does not diminish their liability for this absolute offence (i.e. not requiring any guilty knowledge or mens rea ).
This type of contravention of the offence will be gradually phased out by the new ‘life’ licences, although such offences could be committed by 70 year olds, provisional licence holders on expiry of such a licence and people suffering  from certain disabilities who can only hold licences for restricted periods.
It will assist the court if the reason for not having a licence can be mentioned in evidence.
This can be done by putting a suitable question to the defendant and recording his reply.
(b)
In a small number of cases the defendant will have deliberately driven without a licence because he can't pass a test; he is a visitor to Britain and because he has been granted leave to stay, he now requires a licence etc., i.e. within 12 months for a visitor.
Again such knowledge on the part of the defendant should be proved to the court as the sentence will usually be heavier.
(c)
Note that it could be unlawful to act as a steersman without a driving licence.
See glossary at page 2.
Statutory exemptions are provided in section 88 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 and,inter alia , allow a person to drive without a licence or cause or permit another to do so if the driver has held or is entitled to obtain a licence for that class of vehicle and an application for such a licence has been received including in it the date he was driving.
FAILING TO DISPLAY ‘L’ PLATES
Regulation 9 Motor Vehicles (Driving Licences) Regulations 1987 and sections 105 Road Traffic Act 1988
(A) POINTS TO PROVE
l.
That you
2.
being a person to whom a provisional licence to drive a motor vehicle had been granted
3.
failed to comply with a condition subject to which it was granted in that
4.
you drove (or rode)
5.
on a road called…
6.
a motor vehicle, namely a…
7.
without there being displayed in such a manner as to be clearly visible to other persons using the road from within a reasonable distance from the front and back of the vehicle 8.
‘L’ plates in the prescribed form.
(B) MEANING OF TERMS
1.
‘That you ’ Means the person driving the motor vehicle i.e. identify the driver.
2.
‘being a person to whom a provisional licence to drive a motor vehicle had been granted’ Means that the defendant must be issued with a current provisional licence for the class of vehicle he was driving or riding.
3.
‘failed to comply with the conditions subject to which it was granted’ Means that one of the conditions of the provisional licence has not been complied with, i.e. failing to display ‘L’plates in this case
4.
‘you drove (or rode)’
5.
‘on a road called…’
6.
‘a motor vehicle , namely a…’
7.
‘without being displayed in such a manner as to be clearly visible to other persons using the road from within a reasonable distance from the front and back of the vehicle’ This element means that the ‘L’plate must be unobscured, straight, as near to vehicle as possible and not wrapped around the forks of the motor bike or the bumper bar of a car etc.
8.
‘'L’ plates in the prescribed form'.
The prescribed form states that the plates should be a white 7 inches square with a red letter ‘L’ thereon, 4 inches high, 3½ inches wide and 1½ inches thick.
(C) USUAL METHODS OF PROVING THESE POINTS
1.
‘That you ’ See (C) 1 of offence number 1.
2.
‘being a person to whom a provisional licence to drive a motor vehicle had been granted’ Is usually proved by the police officer in the case examining the current provisional licence.
He can simply state in evidence that he examined the licence and found it to be a current provisional.
The details of the licence must be recorded in the pocket book and are usually required in a statement.
A question to the effect ‘Have you any other licence for this vehicle or have you ever passed a Ministry of Transport test for this vehicle?’ can be put to the defendant and entered in the officer's statement of evidence together with the negative reply.
Should the reply be in the affirmative then the offence would not be committed.
3.
‘failed to comply with a condition subject to which it was granted’ This element is proved by outlining the fact that ‘L’plates were not displayed as required by law.
4.
‘you drove (or rode)’ See (C) 2 of offence number 1.
5.
‘on a road called…’
See (C) 4 of offence number l.
6.
‘a motor vehicle , namely a…’
See (C) 3 of offence number 1.
7.
‘without there being displayed in such a manner as to be clearly visible to other persons using the road from within a reasonable distance from the front and back of the vehicle’ The police officer's evidence is required to the effect that both ‘L’plates were missing, one of the two was missing, that the white surround had been cut off, that the ‘L’plates were torn, dirty or otherwise illegible.
Mitigation can be provided for the defendant if evidence is given that bits of string or sticky tape showed where ‘L’ plates had been fitted.
8.
‘L’ plates in the prescribed form'.
Proof is required that the size, shape or colour are not as prescribed  or that there were no ‘L’ plates or only one displayed.
(D) SUPPORTING EVIDENCE
Generally the offence is straightforward as outlined but if an unlicensed pillion passenger on a motor bicycle persuaded the rider to take off his ‘L’ plates or the passenger took them off himself he would aid and abet the rider's offence of no ‘L’plates.
The motive behind this action is usually to reduce the chances of a police check of two on a motor bicycle.
Such checks are frequent where there are two on a motor bicycle with ‘L’ plates.
PROVISIONAL LICENCE HOLDER UNACCOMPANIED
Legislation as offence 14
(A) POINTS TO PROVE
1.
to
6.
as offence 14;
7.
being a class or description which he was authorised to drive by virtue of.the provisional licence;
8.
otherwise than under the supervision;
9.
of a qualified driver;
10.
who was present with him in or on the vehicle.
(B) MEANING OF TERMS
1.
to
6.
as offence 14
7.
‘being a class or description which he was authorised to drive by virtue of a provisional licence’ The class or description of the motor vehicle when the provisional licence holder is required to be accompanied is as shown in his provisional licence.
8.
‘otherwise than under the supervision’ It is a question of fact in each case whether or not the qualified driver was supervising.
The duty of the supervisor is to  prevent the learner from acting unskillfully or carelessly or in a manner likely to cause danger to others.
If the ‘qualified driver’ does not do what can be reasonably expected of him regarding these duties the learner could be said to be not under supervision.
9.
‘of a qualified driver’ The supervisor must be a ‘qualified driver’as defined in regulation 9(6) of the Motor Vehicles (Driving Licences) Regulations 1987, namely, a person who holds a full licence authorising him to drive as a full licence holder a motor vehicle of the same class or description as the vehicle being driven by the holder of the provisional licence.
A pass slip and a provisional licence are not a ‘full licence’ for the purposes of this regulation.
10.
‘who was present with him in or on the vehicle’.
The learner cannot argue that he was being correctly supervised by someone standing on the footpath or in radio contact with him etc.
(C) USUAL METHOD OF PROVING THESE POINTS
1.
to
6.
as offence 14.
7.
‘being a class or description which he was authorised to drive by virtue of a provisional licence’ By showing in the police officer's statement of evidence that the provisional licence he held covered the class of vehicle he was driving.
If not authorised to drive the class in question the correct offence would be driving without a licence (offence number 13).
8.
‘otherwise than under the supervision’ The most usual way of proving this point will be that the learner was alone in the vehicle.
Occasionally he will be accompanied by a ‘qualified driver’ but because such person was asleep, drunk or poorly etc., the learner would not be classed as being supervised.
The observations of a witness  or an admission by the accused would prove this point.
9.
‘of a qualified driver’ This point is proved by examining the details of the licence of anyone accompanying the learner to see if the licence complies with the definition of qualified driver at (B) 9 of this offence.
If it does there is no offence.
A police officer can demand the production of the driving licence of a ‘qualified driver’ under the Road Traffic Act.
10.
‘who was present with him or on the vehicle’.
This is proved as at (C) 8, inasmuch as the learner will be alone in the vehicle.
(D) SUPPORTING EVIDENCE
The supervisor can aid and abet the earner to drive while over the prescribed limit etc.
A conviction ensued where the supervisor had been drinking with the driver who was seen to swerve from side to side (Crampton v Fish (1969), 113 SJ 1003).
A US forces driving permit is not sufficient to allow supervision (Urey v Lummie ,[1962]2 All ER 463) as a ‘licence’ means a licence to drive a motor vehicle granted under Part III of the Road Traffic Act 1988.
CARRYING AN UNLICENSED PASSENGER ON A MOTOR BIKE
Legislation as offence 14
(A) POINTS TO PROVE
1.
to
6
as offence 14;
7.
and not having attached thereto a sidecar;
8.
while carrying on it a person who was not a qualified driver.
(B) MEANING OF TERMS
1.
to
6.
as offence 14.
7.
‘and not having attached thereto a sidecar’ A flat tubular framework attached to a motor bicycle with a wheel on an axle welded to that framework is not a sidecar for this purpose (Cox v Harrison ,[l 968]3 All ER 8 11).
Note that such an attachment may suffice to allow a learner to drive a motor cycle in excess of 250cc.
In Keen v Parker [1976]RTR 213 it was held that a sidecar designed for the carriage of goods was just as much a sidecar as one which carried passengers.
8.
‘while carrying on it a person who was not a qualified driver’.
‘Qualified driver’ is defined at (B) 9 of offence 15.
(C) USUAL METHOD OF PROVING THESE POINTS
1.
to
6.
as offence 14.
7.
‘and not having attached thereto a sidecar’ In the majority of this type of offence there will not be a sidecar fitted.
But in a few cases careful evidence must be gathered to show whether the attachment falls within Cox v Harrison at (B) 7 above.
A sketch plan may prove helpful.
8.
‘while carrying on it a person who was not a qualified driver’.
There must be evidence, usually of the police officer's observations, that there was a pillion passenger.
Together with this evidence must be the proof that the passenger was not licensed for that class of vehicle etc.
Care must be taken with the passenger's replies as they will be hearsay unless in the driver's presence.
Ways around this problem include asking the driver ‘Is the pillion passenger a qualified driver?’
Or a passage in the police officer's statement to the effect ‘As a result of what I said to him…he was unable to produce a driving licence for that class of vehicle’.
(D) SUPPORTING EVIDENCE
If it can be proved that the pillion passenger knew the  driver was only a learner the passenger would most likely commit the offence of aiding and abetting the learner to carry an unlicensed passenger.
DRIVING WITH EXCESS ALCOHOL
Section 5(1) Road Traffic Act 1988
(A) POINTS TO PROVE
1.
That you
2.
did drive (or attempt to drive or was in charge of)
3.
a certain motor vehicle, namely…
4.
on a road (or public place) called…
5.
after consuming so much alcohol that the proportion thereof in your breath (blood or urine) exceeds the prescribed limit.
(B) MEANING OF TERMS
1.
‘That you ’ Means the person driving over the prescribed limit, i.e. the identity of the driver.
2.
‘did drive (or attempt to drive or was in charge of)’ 'Attempting to drive' means that there must be an act substantially close to actually driving.
Acts such as trying to start the engine, or a person who is sitting in the driving seat trying to put the vehicle in gear or ‘revving up’ the engine (even though the clutch had burnt out)(R v Farrance [1978]Crim LR 496) are examples of ‘attempting to drive’, provided there is an immediate intention of driving.
‘In charge of’ means that once a person takes a vehicle on a road or public place he normally remains in charge of that vehicle until he has taken it off the road or public place again.
He will cease to be in charge where some intervening act occurs to remove the responsibility for being in charge from him.
An example would be where someone else takes charge of the vehicle to such a degree that he will not resume control  of the vehicle, such as where he gives his friend the ignition key and a taxi is ordered to take him home.
3.
‘a certain motor vehicle , namely…‘
4.
‘on a road (or public place) called…‘'Public place’ means any place to which the public have access, e.g. a farmer's field near a race course which is used for parking purposes on race days.
This was so notwithstanding that the field could be closed at any time and that certain people could be refused admission.
Generally a place is public if the majority of the public have access to it.
A place is private and this offence cannot be committed where only a minority group of the public are admitted.
For example where a field leading to a river could only be used according to a sign for ‘Parking — Members of the Walton Angling Club only’, it would constitute a private field.
If the sign said ‘Parking — No Caravans’, a restricted class cannot use the field, but as the majority group could use it the field would be a public place.
5.
‘after consuming so much alcohol that the proportion thereof in your breath (blood or urine) exceeds the prescribed limit’.
The prescribed limits at present are:
(a)
35 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath
(b)
80 milligrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood
(c)
107 milligrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of urine
(C) USUAL METHODS OF PROVING THESE POINTS
1.
‘That you ’ See (C) I of offence number 1.
2.
‘did drive (or attempt to drive or was in charge of)’ See (C) 2 of offence number I for ‘drive’.
‘Attempt to drive’ can be proved by the officer in the case or another witness who saw the defendant attempting to  drive.
An admission on the part of the defendant would also help the prosecution case.
Failing an admission a question to the defendant such as‘Where did you intend to go when you got into your car?’ or ‘What were you trying to do?’etc. may help to prove that he had an intention to drive as discussed at point (B) 2 ante .
The precise details of the evidence of attempting to drive that the officer or other witness saw must be shown in their statements of evidence.
‘In charge of’ can be proved by the police officer or other witness who saw him near or sat in the vehicle for example .
Questions to determine whether he had taken any steps to prevent him driving may be necessary, such as‘Where are the ignition keys?’ or ‘Is anybody else in charge of this vehicle?’
See part (D) for the statutory defence to being in charge.
3.
‘a certain motor vehicle , namely…
‘See (C) 3 of offence number 1,
4.
‘on a road (or public place) called…
‘See (C) 4 of offence number I for ‘road’.
To prove whether a place is ‘public’ could necessitate taking a statement from a person who had authorised access to a normally private place; enquiring about and keeping observations on the place to show actual usage; or describing any permanent or temporary signs that relate to who had access.
5.
‘after consuming so much alcohol the proportion thereof in your breath (blood or urine) exceeds the prescribed limit’.
Evidence of the proportion of alcohol in a specimen of breath, blood or urine may be by a document which is:
(a)
a statement automatically produced by the breath analysis machine by which the proportion of alcohol in the breath specimen was measured and certificate signed by a constable that the statement relates to a specimen provided by the accused at the date and time shown in the statement, and 
(b)
a certificate signed by an authorised analyst.
Where an analyst's findings are challenged by the defence the prosecution could call the analyst to give evidence to explain, his findings to the court.
(D) SUPPORTING EVIDENCE
(a)
It is a defence for a person charged with ‘Being in Charge’ to prove that at the time he is alleged to have committed the offence the circumstances were such that there was no likelihood of his driving the vehicle whilst the proportion of alcohol in his breath, blood or urine remained likely to exceed the prescribed limit; but in determining whether there was such a likelihood the court may disregard any injury to him and any damage to the vehicle.
The last part of this defence means that just because driving was impossible because of injury to him or damage to the vehicle, the court will not automatically find him not guilty.
The court can disregard any injury or damage and still find that he was in charge of the vehicle.
(b)
Consider the offence of driving, attempting to drive or being in charge of a motor vehicle on a road or public place whilst unfit to drive through drink and drugs, where appropriate.
Drugs include any intoxicant other than alcohol therefore even solvent abuse and driving may be covered by this offence.
The offence of obstructing the police under section 51 Of the Police Act 1964 may be appropriate where the accused deliberately obstructs the police in the execution of their duty.
(c)
Most police forces have produced a pro-forma to lead the officer in charge of the case through the procedure.
The majority of these forms have been in use since October 1967 when the drink/driving law regarding being over the prescribed limit (OPL) was introduced.
The forms have been found to work well in practice.
The necessity for long entries  in the constable's pocket book has been eliminated.
The general idea with pro-formas is that they should be filled in as the procedure progresses in order to qualify as ‘notes made at the time’.
Such notes can be used to refresh memories and it has been found that a most accurate record of the investigation of OPL offences can thus be obtained.

every three-wheeled motor cycle, the unladen weight of which exceeds 255 kilograms and which was manufactured on or after March I, 1970 and first used on or after September 1, 1970.
Regulation 46(2) provides that this Regulation does not apply to —
(a)
a goods vehicle (other than a dual-purpose vehicle), which is first used —
(i)
before April I, 1967; or
(ii)
on or after April 1 1980 and has a maximum gross weight in Great Britain (determined in accordance with the provisions of Schedule 2) exceeding 3500 kg; or
(iii)
before April I, 1980 or, if the vehicle is of a model manufactured before October 1,1979, was first used before April 1,1982 and, in either case, has an unladen weight exceeding 1525 kg;
(b)
a passenger vehicle or dual-purpose vehicle being in either case a vehicle constructed or adapted to carry more than 12 passengers exclusive of the driver;
(c)
an agricultural motor vehicle;
(d)

(i)
a vehicle which is incapable by reason of its construction of exceeding a speed of 16 miles per hour on the level under its own power
(j)
a motor cycle in certain cases.
All vehicles that are required to have seat belts fitted must have seat belts fitted to the driver's seat and the specified passenger's seat.
The specified passenger's seat is defined by regulation 47(8) as —
(i)
in the case of a vehicle which has one forward-facing front seat alongside the driver's seat, such seat, and in the  case of a vehicle which has more than one such seat, the one furthest from the driver's seat; or
(ii)
if the vehicle normally has no seat which is the specified passenger's seat under the last preceding sub-paragraph, the forward-facing front seat for a passenger which is foremost in the vehicle and furthest from the driver's seat, unless there is a fixed partition separating such seat from the space in front of it alongside the driver's seat.
Exceptions are given under regulation 5 The Motor Vehicles (Wearing-of Seat Belts) Regulations 1982:
The requirement specified in Regulation 4 does not apply to a person who is —
(a)
using a vehicle constructed or adapted for the delivery or collection of goods or mail to consumers or addressees, as the case may be, whilst engaged in making local rounds of deliveries or collections;
(b)
driving the vehicle whilst performing a manoeuvre which includes reversing;
(c)
a qualified driver (as defined in regulation 8(5) of the Driving Licences Regulations) and is supervising the holder of a provisional licence (as defined in regulation 3(1) of those regulations) while the holder is performing a manoeuvre which includes reversing

(i)
a taxi which is being used for seeking hire, or answering a call for hire; or
(ii)
a private hire vehicle which is being used to carry a passenger for hire;
(i)
a person by whom, as provided in the Driving Licences Regulations, a test of competence to drive is being conducted and his wearing a seat belt would endanger himself or any other person;
(j)

(i)
does not comply with the requirements of the Construction and Use Regulations; or
(ii)
has an inertia reel mechanism which is locked as a result of the vehicle being, or having been, on a steep incline;
or
(k)
riding in a vehicle, being used under a trade licence, for the purpose of investigating or remedying a mechanical fault in the vehicle.
4.
‘In a motor vehicle ’
5.
‘on a road ’
6.
‘whilst not wearing a prescribed type of seat belt’.
This point means a seat belt as defined in the Construction and Use Regulations.
(C) USUAL METHODS OF PROVING THESE POINTS
1.
‘That you ’ See (C) I of offence number l.
2.
‘did drive /were a passenger’ These points can be proved by the police officer's observations in his statement of evidence.
3.
‘requiring a seat belt’ This can be proved in the majority of cases by showing that the vehicle was a normal saloon car being fitted with approved seat belts.
In practice a question to the defendant  on the lines of ‘Is there any reason why you aren't wearing your seat belt? would cater for the cases where he or the vehicle is exempt.
4.
‘in a motor vehicle ’ See (C) 3 of offence number one.
5.
‘on a road ’
6.
‘whilst not wearing a prescribed type of seat belt’.
This point can be proved in the majority of cases by the observations of the reporting officer.
Where there is any doubt as to whether the seat belt is as prescribed, regulation 47 of the Construction and Use Regulations will have to be consulted.
Normally the following sentence in the reporting officer's statement will suffice: ‘The seat belt was fitted and was in good working order when I tested it.
I saw that the driver (passenger) was not wearing it.’
DANGEROUS PARTS
Regulation 100(1) Motor Vehicles (Construction and Use) Regulations 1986, and section 40A Road Traffic Act 1988
(A) POINTS TO PROVE
1.
That you
2.
did use (or cause, or permit to be used)
3.
on a road called…
4.
a certain motor vehicle namely a…(or trailer drawn by a motor vehicle)
5.
a part (or accessory) of which, namely…(specify)
6.
was in such condition, that danger was caused
7.
or was likely to be caused to persons in or on that vehicle (or trailer) or on a road in that…(specify defect).
(B) MEANING OF TERMS
1.
‘That you Means the identity of the person using, causing or permitting  the use of the motor vehicle.
2.
‘did use (or cause, or permit to be used)’
3.
‘on a road called…‘
4.
‘a certain motor vehicle namely a…’(or trailer drawn by a motor vehicle).
5.
‘a part (or accessory) of which…’
Means that such things as doors, windows and wings are parts and such things as wing mirrors, windscreen wipers and roof racks are accessories.
A tow chain has been held not to be a ‘part’(Jenkins v Deane (1933), 103 LJKB 250) but a tow bar connecting a vehicle and a trailer together has been held to come within the regulation where the joining was defective (O'Neill v Brown 119611 1 QB 420),
6.
‘was in such condition, that danger was caused’ This point means that the condition caused danger or in other words injured someone.
For example where a hole appears in the wing of a car and a pedestrian is cut by the sharp rusty edges of the hole, then danger is caused.
In Reeve v Webb (1972) 1 1 7 Sol Jo 1 27 it was held that alterations to exhaust pipes fall within another part of this regulation.
7.
‘or was likely to be caused to persons in or on that vehicle (or trailer ) or on a road ’ 'Likely to be caused' means potentially dangerous such as sharp edges jutting out from the body of a motor vehicle; a loose driver's seat which could cause loss of control of the car; projecting wheel wing nuts or mudguards that could strike a pedestrian; and a loose rear bumper that might fall off and cause an accident etc.
‘to persons in or on that vehicle (or trailer) 'means that the danger or potential danger is sufficient if it applies to passengers or even the driver of the motor vehicle concerned.
‘or on a road’ covers potential danger or actual danger to pedestrians or anyone not actually in or on the offending motor vehicle.
(C) USUAL METHODS OF PROVING THESE POINTS
1.
‘That you ’ See (C) I of offence number 1.
2.
‘did use (or cause, or permit to be used)’ See (C) 2 of offence number 5.
In the case of ‘use’ for construction and use offences there is an absolute prohibition on the part of the employer.
If an offence is committed and the employer was quite unaware of any defect he is still liable for ‘using’(Green v Burnett [1954]3 All ER 273).
Therefore, to prove the offence of using against the employer as well as against the driver, the employer must be interviewed and questioned as follows: ‘Are you (or your firm) the owner of motor vehicle…?’ 'Then ‘was the vehicle being used on your (or your firm's) business at…(time)…on…(date)…in…(road)…?’
For the offence of ‘using’ these questions must receive the answer ‘Yes’.
While it is not necessary to prove the employer knew of any defect it is good evidence for the prosecution if he admits he did.
3.
‘on a road called…’
See (C) 4 of offence number 1.
4.
‘a certain motor vehicle namely a…’(or trailer drawn by a motor vehicle)’ See (C) 3 of offence number 1.
5.
‘a part (or accessory) of which, namely…’(specify) This point can be proved by the police officer dealing with the case describing the item in question in his statement of evidence, e.g. ‘The front nearside wing was badly corroded…etc.’
Specific details of the defective parts and/or accessories must be given in the charge and therefore in the prosecution evidence (Simmons v Fowler (1950) 48 L.G.R. 623).
6.
‘was in such condition, that danger was caused’ This point is proved, firstly by the prosecution witness (most likely the police officer) examining the personal injury and describing it in his evidence.
Secondly, a statement from the injured party detailing the injury and how it was caused would be required.
7.
‘or was likely to be caused to person in or on that vehicle (or trailer) or on a road in that…
Where no injury is caused, the above element has to be proved.
This is usually done by the subjective judgment of the officer concerned.
Namely, a sentence in the police officer's statement of evidence to the effect that ‘Should anyone come into contact with the jagged metal on the front nearside wing they would be injured’, or ‘If a pedestrian collided with the piece of metal left after the front nearside wing mirror had broken off, he would be injured’.
The court will then use its judgment regarding the proof of potential danger.
(D) SUPPORTING EVIDENCE
Several other offences are included in the above regulations but are not quite so common as the offence outlined.
The other offences include the number and manner of carrying of passengers being dangerous or potentially dangerous; insecure or dangerous load; and using a motor vehicle for an unsuitable purpose.
DEFECTIVE BRAKES
Regulation 18 Motor Vehicles (Construction and Use) Regulations 1986 and section 41A Road Traffic Act 1988
(A) POINTS TO PROVE
1.
That you
2.
did use (or cause or permit to be used)
3.
on a road called…
4.
a motor vehicle, namely a…(or trailer)
5.
on which a part of (the means of operation of) the braking system fitted thereto
6.
was not maintained in good and efficient working order and properly adjusted.
(B) MEANING OF TERMS
1.
‘That you ’ Means the identity of the person using, causing or permitting the use
2.
‘did use (or cause or permit to be used)’
3.
‘on a road called’
4.
‘a motor vehicle , namely a…(or trailer )’
5.
‘on which a part of (the means of operation of) the braking system fitted thereto’ This point means that ‘a part’, e.g. the brake shoes or brake pads were not maintained and/or the ‘means of operation’such as the hand brake lever ratchet or the cable (if fitted) were not maintained.
It was held in Kennelt v British Airport Authority [1975]Crim LR 106 that every part of the braking system and of the means of operation must be maintained etc.
Note that a brake drum is part of the wheel and not the braking system.
6.
‘was not maintained in good efficient working order and properly adjusted’.
This point means an absolute requirement for a person to maintain his brakes to escape liability.
It is insufficient to show that the brakes were regularly maintained.
‘Not maintained’ usually includes worn, seized or rusted parts etc. and ‘not properly adjusted’includes stretched cables or inoperative self-adjusting ratchets on drum brakes etc.
(C) USUAL METHODS OF PROVING THESE POINTS
1.
‘That you ’ See (C) I of offence number I
2.
‘did use (or cause or permit to be used)’ See (C) 2 of offence number 5.
In the case of ‘use’ for construction and use offences see (C) 2 of offence number 19.
3.
‘on a road called…’
See (C) 4 of offence number 1.
4.
‘a motor vehicle , namely a…(or trailer )’ See (C) 3 of offence number 1.
5.
‘on which a part of (the means of operation of) the braking system, fitted thereto’ This point can be proved by showing the brakes don't work by a simple test such as pushing the vehicle along the road with the brake(s) set.
If a vehicle examiner who has been authorised by a chief constable examines the brakes his evidence will show a more detailed inspection and will probably name the ‘part’ concerned.
Note that an officer who is not authorised to test and inspect will have to ask the driver before his examination.
If refused he can hold the vehicle until an authorised examiner arrives where he feels it would be dangerous for the vehicle to proceed.
If the driver still refuses to wait he commits a further possible offence, but there is no power to detain or ‘arrest’ the vehicle.
6.
‘was not maintained in good and efficient working order and properly adjusted’.
This point is proved along with the last point.
Obviously defective parts such as broken brake cable, leaking hydraulic fluid, or a handbrake that won't catch on its ratchet etc., can be proved by the observations of almost anyone.
Where an accident is caused by alleged brake failure, or other more technical circumstances arise, the services of a trained vehicle examiner may be required.
The most common brake defects are worn shoes and pads, seized cylinders and poor adjustment.
In Stoneley v Richardson [1973]RTR 229 it was held that defective brakes do not have to be proved by an authorised examiner.
Provided the defendant consents to the  test or inspection the person examining the brakes (usually a constable) does not need to be an authorised examiner.
Inefficiency etc. is sometimes proved by the use of an instrument which measures braking efficiency, called a Tapley meter.
(D) SUPPORTING EVIDENCE
(a)
F. Austin (Leyton) Ltd v East [1961]Crim LR 119 is authority for saying that a latent defect amounting to a dangerous condition is not a defence but would be good mitigation.
The facts of this case showed that there was no negligence but nevertheless such offences are absolute.
(b)
A practical consideration when testing vehicle parts is for the defendant to be asked to apply the part such as brakes himself.
In this way an allegation to the effect that the officer did not apply the brake correctly may be quickly dealt with by saying ‘After (the officer) tested the brakes and found the handbrake to be defective I asked the defendant to apply the handbrake.
He did so but could not get it to work.’
DEFECTIVE WINDSCREEN WIPERS
Regulation 34(6) Motor Vehicles (Construction and Use) Regulations 1986 and section 42 of the Road Traffic Act 1988
(A) POINTS TO PROVE
1.
That you
2.
did use (or cause or permit to be used)
3.
on a road called…
4.
a motor vehicle, namely a…
5.
on which the windscreen wiper was not maintained in good and efficient working order, and/or properly adjusted.
(B) MEANING OF TERMS
1.
‘That you ’ Means the person's identity.
2.
‘did use (or cause or permit to be used)’
3.
‘on a road called…‘
4.
‘a motor vehicle , namely a…’
5.
‘on which the windscreen wiper was not maintained in good and efficient working order and/or properly adjusted’.
The point means that the switch, the motor or the arms or blades were defective or missing etc.
Common faults are wiper blades missing or the electric motor failing.
(C) USUAL METHODS OF PROVING THESE POINTS
1.
‘That you ’ See (C) I of offence number 1.
2.
‘did use (or cause or permit to be used)’ See (C) 2 of offence number 5, and (C) 2 of offence number 19.
3.
‘on a road called…’
See (C) 4 of offence number 1.
4.
‘a motor vehicle , namely a…’
See (C) 3 of offence number 1.
5.
‘on which the windscreen wiper was not maintained in good and efficient working order and/or properly adjusted’.
This point can simply be proved by testing the wipers and getting no response.
Where the motor is working the offence can still be committed where the arm or blade is missing.
The defendant should also be asked to operate the wipers to avoid allegations to the effect that the wipers were not switched on correctly.
(D) SUPPORTING EVIDENCE
(a)
Depending on the make of motor vehicle, normally there are two wipers fitted and both must work as regulation 34(1) of the above regulation insists that…an adequate view  of the road in front of the near and offsides of the vehicle…is required.
But this is the general position and in vehicles like Minis it could be argued that such a view can be obtained when only the wiper in front of the driver works, therefore each vehicle must be dealt with separately.
(b)
Regulation 34(1) states that if a view to the front can be obtained without looking through the windscreen, wipers are not required.
Only old vehicles pre about 1940 and the occasional newer vehicle such as the Land Rover have the front opening windscreens.
DEFECTIVE SILENCER
Regulation 54(1) Motor Vehicles (Construction and Use) Regulations 1986 and section 42 of the Road Traffic Act 1988
(A) POINTS TO PROVE
1.
That you
2.
did use (or cause or permit to be used)
3.
on a road called…
4.
a vehicle propelled by an internal combustion engine, namely a…
5.
so that the exhaust gases from the engine escaped into the atmosphere without first passing through the silencer, expansion chamber or other contrivance required to be fitted by the Motor Vehicles (Construction and Use) Regulations.
(B) MEANING OF TERMS
1.
‘That you , Means the identity of the person using the motor vehicle etc.
2.
‘did use (or cause or permit to be used)’
3.
‘on a road called…’
4.
a vehicle propelled by an internal combustion engine, namely a…’
As the majority of vehicles are propelled in this manner, this point speaks for itself.
5.
‘so that the exhaust gases from the engine escaped into the atmosphere without first passing through the silencer, expansion chamber or other contrivance required to be fitted by the Motor Vehicles (Construction and Use) Regulations’.
This point means for example that the gases from the engine escape from the faulty manifold (which is at the exit point adjacent to the engine) or a broken front pipe, a broken expansion chamber or from the silencer provided this occurs before they pass through it.
These regulation require that either a silencer, expansion chamber or other contrivance is fined as may be reasonable to reduce the noise.
If an exhaust system has two such articles this offence is not committed if the gases pass through any such article before escaping into the atmosphere.
(C) USUAL METHODS OF PROVING THESE POINTS
1.
‘That you ’ See (C) I of offence number 1.
2.
‘did use (or cause or permit to be used)’ See (C) 2 of offence number 5 and (C) 2 of offence number 19.
3.
‘on a road called…’
See (C) 4 of offence number 1.
4.
‘a vehicle propelled by an internal combustion engine, namely a…’
This point can be proved by describing the vehicle in the police officer's statement who is dealing with the case, e.g. ‘I caused the defendant, John Smith to stop the Ford saloon motor car registered number…etc.’
5.
‘so that the exhaust gases from the engine escaped into the atmosphere without first passing through the silencer, expansion chamber or other contrivance required to be  fitted by the Motor Vehicles (Construction and Use) Regulations’, This point can be proved by inspecting the silencer system with the engine running and watching where the gases are escaping.
In the vast majority of cases the exhaust pipe corrodes around the bend which goes over the rear axle on motor cars or that particular pipe breaks away from the end of the silencer.
However, there is no offence against this regulation if only the tail pipe (i.e. the piece leading the gases into the atmosphere from the end of the silencer which is the furthest from the engine) is defective, as the gases will have passed through the silencer.
(D) SUPPORTING EVIDENCE
Note the further offence of failing to maintain such a system contrary to Regulation 54(2) of these regulations.
This offence can be considered where a hole appears in the side of the silencer etc., as some doubt exists whether the gases have passed ‘through’ the silencer etc., if they have passed through half of the silencer, Until there is judicial assistance to say that such gases must pass all the way through a silencer to escape liability under regulation 54(1), a regulation 54(2) offence may be the safest offence.
DEFECTIVE TYRES
Regulation 27(1) Motor Vehicles (Construction and Use) Regulations 1986 and Section 41A of the Road Traffic Act 1988
(A) POINTS TO PROVE
1.
That you
2.
used (or caused or permitted to be used)
3.
on a road called…
4.
a motor vehicle (or trailer), namely a…
5.
fitted with a pneumatic tyre
6.
whose grooves of the tread pattern of the tyre did not have a depth of at least 1.6 mm throughout a continuous band situated in the central three-quarters of the breadth of the tread and round the entire outer circumference of the tyre.
(B) MEANING OF TERMS
1.
‘That you ’ Means the identity of the person using the motor vehicle etc.
2.
‘used (or caused or permitted to be used)’
3.
‘on a road called…’
4.
‘a motor vehicle (or trailer ) namely a…’
With effect from I January 1992 the ‘old’ offences at paragraphs (f) and (g) of regulation 27(1) of the 1986 Regulations no longer apply to passenger motor cars other than motor cars constructed or adapted to carry more than eight seated passengers in addition to the driver, or to goods vehicles with a maximum gross weight which does not exceed 3,500 kg.
The new offence applies to motor cars and goods vehicles other than those shown above and also applies to light trailers first used on or after 3 January 1933 ie, a trailer with a maximum gross weight not exceeding 3,500 kg.
In other words the old offences under (f) and (g) above now apply to eight or more seated motor cars or goods vehicles 3,500 kg or under and to the other categories of vehicle not mentioned here.
The new offence applies to the vast majority of motor cars and trailers and goods vehicles 3,500 kg or under.
5.
‘fitted with a pneumatic tyre’ Pneumatic tyre means inflatable as opposed to the early tyre or solid tyres.
6.
‘whose grooves on the tread pattern did not have a depth of at least 1.6mm throughout a continuous band situated in the central three-quarters of the breadth of the tread and round the entire outer circumference of the tyre.’
‘Tread pattern’ means the raised and lowered pattern which, in modern tyres, is provided around the walls of the tyre to a small degree as well as where the tyre makes contact with the road surface.
‘Tread’ is the part of the tyre which comes into contact with the road surface in normal driving, i.e. not when cornering at speed.
Therefore, this point means that the tyre did not have a 1.6 mm depth of tread pattern grooves around the tyre in a continuous band situated in the central three-quarters of the width of the tread.
It follows that if there is a small bald patch (or a patch with grooves less than 1.6 mm deep) 4 cm in diameter on a tread width of 12 cm an offence is committed for 4 cm is more than a quarter of the 12 cm width of tread.
It is important to note that the bald patch or the patch without the 1.6 mm depth of tread grooves is not required to go right around the tyre.
It is sufficient to contravene this regulation where the patch is more than a quarter of the breadth of the tread, because there cannot be at least three-quarters of good tread around the whole circumference of the tyre in such a case.
It should be noted that the required three-quarters width of 1.6 mm tread pattern grooves should be in a continuous band.
Therefore, where the tread is below 1.6 mm depth in the middle of the tread and around the circumference of the tyre it is no good the defendant adding up the ‘bits’ on either side of the worn part to try to make a good three-quarters.
(C) USUAL METHODS OF PROVING THESE POINTS
1.
‘That you ’ See (C) I of offence number 1.
2.
‘used (or caused or permitted to be used)’ See (C) 2 of offence number 5 and (C) 2 of offence number 19.
3.
‘on a road called…
‘See (C) 4 of offence number 1.
4.
‘a motor vehicle (or trailer), namely a…’
Proof of the number of seats in a passenger motor car or the maximum gross weight of a goods vehicle may be necessary to show this new offence applies to the vehicle in question, eg. ‘The motor car had been adapted to carry 8 seated passengers in addition to the driver’(but not more than 8 ).
5.
‘fitted with a pneumatic tyre’ This point is proved by describing the tyre in question, e.g. ‘The front nearside tyre was a radial, such and such a make, size 165 × 14 and was designed as a tubeless tyre’.
It is important for the prosecution case to try to identify the tyre by taking the tyre or batch number which will usually be something like 824927 E, on the tyre wall in letters and figures about I cm high — in about a quarter of all checks the number is nonexistent or illegible and the police officer should try to remember other forms of identification such as marks or scratches etc. on the tyre.
This precaution may well deter a dishonest defendant bringing a totally different tyre to court and alleging that the officer was mistaken as the tyre was within the law.
6.
‘whose grooves of the tread pattern of the tyre did not have a depth of at least 1.6 mm throughout a continuous band situated in the central three-quarters of the breadth of the tread and round the entire outer circumference of the tyre’.
This point is proved beyond any doubt when a completely bald patch exceeding a quarter of the breadth of the tread is present.
In the other case where the depth of the tread pattern grooves is in issue an approved measuring device can be used.
(D) SUPPORTING EVIDENCE
(a)
In the case of Stoneley v Richardson [1973]Crim LR 310 it was held that it does not matter whether or not the  constable who inspected the tyre was an authorised examiner under section 67 Road Traffic Act 1988.
Where the constable is not authorised the defendant could have allowed the constable to carry out the inspection.
Each tyre must be treated as a separate entity and separate informations must be laid where offences concern more than one tyre (Saines v Woodhouse [1970]2 All ER 388).
This includes double tyres on lorries and close coupled wheels.
(b)
The further offences under regulation 27 should be considered.
These are Regulation 27(1) (a) to (h) with the exception of (f) and (g).
QUITTING WITHOUT STOPPING ENGINE AND SETTING BRAKE
Regulation 107(1) Motor Vehicles (Construction and Use) Regulations 1986, and section 42 Road Traffic Act 1988
(A) POINTS TO PROVE
1.
That you
2.
did cause (or permit)
3.
to be on a road called…
4.
a motor vehicle, namely a…
5.
which was not attended
6.
by a person duly licensed to drive it
7.
without the engine being stopped and/or
8.
without the parking brake being effectively set.
(B) MEANING OF TERMS
1.
‘That you ’ Means the person quitting the vehicle
2.
‘did cause (or permit)’
3.
‘to be on a road called…‘
4.
‘a motor vehicle , namely a…’
Notable exceptions include police, fire brigade and ambulance purposes, and vehicles which require the engine to run  to operate special machinery or apparatus such as a gulley emptying vehicle.
5.
‘which was not attended’ Means there is no person able to keep it under observation and reach it in time to prevent anything untoward (Starfire Diamond Rings Ltd v Angel (1962) 106 SJ 854 and Ingleton of Ilford Ltd v General Accident & Co [1967]2 Lloyd's Rep 179).
6.
‘by a person duly licensed to drive it’ Means that if anyone is in attendance at the vehicle then to escape this regulation he must be the holder of a current driving licence for that class of vehicle.
7.
‘without the engine being stopped’ Means that apart from the exceptions at regulation 107(2) (a) and (b)(the main ones are shown at 4 ante ), the engines of all motor vehicles must be stopped when the vehicles are unattended.
8.
‘without the parking brake being effectively set’.
Means that the handbrake (in the case of a saloon motor car) was not set.
The driver could have applied the brake but because of a defective ratchet, for instance, the brake could have slipped and as a result would not be effectively set.
(C) USUAL METHODS OF PROVING THESE POINTS
1.
‘That you ’ See (C) I of offence number 1.
2.
‘did cause (or permit)’ See (C) 2 of offence number 5.
3.
‘to be on a road called…’
See (C) 4 of offence number 1.
4.
‘a motor vehicle , namely a…’
See (C) 3 of offence number 1.
5.
‘which was not attended’ Generally this point is proved by the officer finding an unattended vehicle with the engine running.
After making unsuccessful enquiries to find the driver in the immediate area, these facts can be used to prove the unattended element.
6.
‘by a person duly licensed to drive it’ The problem of hearsay evidence can occur where a passenger in a motor vehicle has to be asked whether or not he holds a current licence for the class of vehicle.
His answer will be something that another person, not the defendant, said.
A way round this hearsay evidence is for the officer to say ‘The passenger Mr. Jones says he is not licensed to drive this car so I am reporting you (the defendant) for quitting a vehicle’ etc.
If the passenger is not in possession of a licence, but states he is the holder of the necessary licence, further enquiries will be made by the police officer to ascertain whether or not he is a duly licensed driver.
If not, the defendant driver can be seen later and told he will be reported.
7.
‘without the engine being stopped’ This point can be proved by the observations of the officer dealing, namely, ‘The engine was running, ignition key switched on, exhaust fumes coming from exhaust pipe’etc.
8.
‘without the parking brake being effectively set’.
This point can be proved by pushing the vehicle along the road to show there was no braking effect; by things speaking for themselves where the unattended vehicle runs away, down hill; and by observing the handbrake lever in the off position etc.
Failing to set the handbrake is sometimes detected when it is too late i.e. when a vehicle has been parked unattended and has then begun to move and run away downhill, perhaps resulting in an accident.
In such a case a careful examination of the handbrake should be made bearing this offence in mind.
If necessary the prosecution might call a vehicle examiner to give evidence where there is some technical failure of the handbrake such as a worn ratchet  causing the brake lever to slip or a frayed cable which snapped under pressure.
(D) SUPPORTING EVIDENCE
A person failing to set the handbrake can also be reported for leaving a vehicle in a dangerous position contrary to section 22 Road Traffic Act 1988.
HORNS NOT FITTED
Regulation 37 Motor Vehicles (Construction and Use) Regulations 1986 and section 42 Road Traffic Act 1988
(A) POINTS TO PROVE
1.
That you
2.
did use (or cause or permit to be used)
3.
on a road called…
4.
a motor vehicle namely a…
5.
which was not fitted
6.
with an instrument capable of giving audible and sufficient warning of its approach or position.
(B) MEANING OF TERMS
1.
‘That you ’ This point means the identity of the person using, causing or permitting to be used
2.
‘did use (or cause or permit to be used)’
3.
‘on a road called..’
4.
‘a motor vehicle namely a..’
The vehicle must have a maximum speed of more than 20 mph.
5.
‘which was not fitted’ This point means that either the motor vehicle in question had no horn fitted at all or that the one that was fitted did not conform to the requirements of the next point.
6.
‘with an instrument capable of giving audible and sufficient warning of its approach or position’.
This point means that the horn if not fitted would hardly be able to warn people.
If fitted it has got to work sufficiently well to warn other road users of its approach etc.
Therefore horns with loose wires where the sound emitted is not continuous and reliable or where the sound is too soft, etc. would not comply with this regulation.
(C) USUAL METHODS OF PROVING THESE POINTS
1.
‘That you ’ See (C) I of offence number 1.
2.
‘did use (or cause or permit to be used)’ See (C) 2 of offence number 5, and in the case of ‘use’for construction and use offences see (C) 2 of offence number 19.
3.
‘on a road called…’
See (C) 4 of offence number 1.
4.
‘a motor vehicle namely a…’
See (C) 3 of offence number 1.
5.
‘which was not fitted’ This point is proved by an examination of the motor vehicle which in these days of mass produced cars will generally reveal that a horn is fitted.
In a few cases where a horn has been removed this can be proved by stating so or by an admission on the part of the defendant.
In most cases the horn will be fitted and although it is not necessary to prove why the horn didn't work when operated it may be of assistance to the court.
In practice it is better to show in evidence for the prosecution that the defendant was also asked to try to get the horn to work as explained at (D)(b) of offence number 20.
6.
‘with an instrument capable of giving audible and sufficient warning of its approach or position’.
This point is proved simply by no sound or insufficient  sound being emitted when the horn, if any, is tested.
Common sense will have to prevail as to whether the noise emitted is sufficient or not.
(D) SUPPORTING EVIDENCE
Several points of interest relating to horns are dealt with at other parts of regulation 37 as below.
(1)
Except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3) below no motor vehicle shall be fitted with a gong, bell, siren or two tone horn.
(2)
The following vehicles may be fitted with a gong, bell, siren or two-tone horn:
(a)
motor vehicles used for fire brigade, ambulance or police purposes
(b)
motor vehicles owned by a body formed primarily for the purpose of fire salvage and used for those or similar purposes
(c)
motor vehicles owned by the Forestry Commission or by local authorities and used from time to time for the purpose of fighting fires;
(d)
motor vehicles owned by the Secretary of State for Defence and used for the purposes of the disposal of bombs or explosives
(e)
motor vehicles used for the purposes of the Blood Transfusion Service provided under the National Health Service Act 1977 or under the National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1947;
(f)
motor vehicles used by Her Majesty's Coastguard or the Coastguard Auxiliary Service to aid persons in danger or vessels in distress on or near the coast
(g)
motor vehicles owned by the National Coal Board and used for the purposes of rescue operations at mines;
(h)
motor vehicles owned by the Secretary of State for Defence and used by the Royal Air Force Mountain Rescue  Service for the purposes of rescue operations in connection with crashed aircraft or any other emergencies; and
(i)
motor vehicles owned by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution and used for the purposes of launching lifeboats.
(3)
The provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) above shall not apply so as to make it unlawful for a motor vehicle to be fitted with an instrument or apparatus other than a two-tone horn designed to emit a sound for the purpose of informing members of the public that goods are on the vehicle for sale.
Note that Colonel Bogey type horns and other such ditties are now unlawful on vehicles first used before August I 1973.
Further paragraphs deal with bells, gongs or sirens being used for theft prevention purposes or to summons help for the conductors, drivers and inspectors of large passenger carrying vehicles.
PEDESTRIAN FAILING TO COMPLY WITH CONSTABLE'S DIRECTION
Section 37 Road Traffic Act 1988
(A) POINTS TO PROVE
1.
That you
2.
being a person on foot
3.
where a police constable (or a traffic warden) in uniform
4.
were engaged in the regulation of vehicular traffic in a road
5.
did proceed across (or along) the carriageway
6.
in contravention of a direction to stop given by the constable (or the traffic warden) in the execution of his duty.
(B) MEANING OF TERMS
1.
‘That you ’ Means the identity of the pedestrian
2.
‘being a person on foot’ Means walking or running etc. as opposed to being carried  in or on a vehicle or riding a horse etc.
It has been held that a person on foot pushing a bicycle when using a zebra pedestrian crossing was a ‘foot passenger’.
3.
‘where a police constable (or a traffic warden) in uniform’ This point means a police constable (as opposed to a cadet) or a traffic warden, both of whom must be in uniform.
It has been held under the drink/driving law that the object of requiring the officer to be ‘in uniform’ was to ensure that the constable would be easily recognised as such by the public.
4.
‘was engaged in the regulation of vehicular traffic in a road’ See (B) 4 of offence number 12.
See glossary at page 3 for ‘road’.
5.
‘did proceed across (or along) the carriageway’ This point means that the pedestrian tried or succeeded in walking across the carriageway i.e. from footpath to footpath or along the carriageway in the same direction as the traffic flow.
6.
‘in contravention of a direction to stop given by the constable (or the traffic warden) in the execution of his duty’.
The signal must be given clearly.
See (B) 7 of offence number 12.
‘Execution of his duty’ means that he should be acting in the protection of life and property.
(C) USUAL METHODS OF PROVING THESE POINTS
1.
‘That you ’ See (C) I of offence number 1.
2.
‘being a person on foot’ This point is proved by the officer or traffic warden stating in evidence ‘A man, I now know to be John Smith, stepped from the kerb on the south side of the road and walked towards me in contravention of my signal to him to stop etc.’
3.
‘where a police constable (or a traffic warden) in uniform’ This point can be proved by starting the officer's or the warden's evidence by ‘I am a police constable (or traffic warden) in such and such a police force and I was in uniform’.
Usually nothing further need be proved in relation to uniform but here problems can be envisaged because an officer had no helmet or tunic on, then the general appearance of the officer could be put in evidence if required in the case of a ‘not guilty’ plea.
4.
‘was engaged in the regulation of vehicular traffic’ This point is proved by the officer or warden stating in evidence that ‘I was engaged in the regulation of traffic to allow pedestrians to cross safely etc.’
5.
‘did proceed across (or along) the carriageway’ This point is proved by the officer or warden describing what the defendant did to contravene the signal as at point 2 above.
6.
‘in contravention of a direction to stop given by the constable (or the traffic warden) in the execution of his duty’.
The officer or warden should describe how he gave the necessary signal, e.g. ‘I raised my right arm with the palm of my hand facing the defendant.
The signal was clearly visible etc…’
The execution of duty is proved as at 4 above.
PARKING ON WRONG SIDE AT NIGHT
Regulation 101 Motor Vehicles (Construction and Use) Regulations 1986 and section 42 Road Traffic Act 1988
(A) POINTS TO PROVE
1.
That you
2.
did cause (or permit)
3.
a motor vehicle, namely a…
4.
to stand on a road called…
5.
during the hours of darkness
6.
otherwise than with the left or nearside  of the vehicle as close as may be to the edge of the carriageway.
(B) MEANING OF TERMS
1.
‘That you ’ Means the identity of the person causing or permitting the offence.
2.
‘did cause (or permit)’ Note that ‘using’is not included.
3.
‘a motor vehicle , namely a…
4.
‘to stand on a road called…
‘Stand’ means in general parlance, parked.
5.
‘during the hours of darkness’ This point means the time between half an hour after sunset to half an hour before sunrise.
Sunset and sunrise are to be taken at the place where the alleged offences were committed.
6.
‘otherwise than with the left or nearside of the vehicle as close as may be to the edge of the carriageway’.
This phrase means what it says.
Obviously a line has to be drawn somewhere.
Should a driver be prosecuted for being 10 cm or a metre away from the kerb?
The circumstances of each case must be the deciding factor as the narrower the road the more important this offence becomes.
(C) USUAL METHODS OF PROVING THESE POINTS
1.
‘That you ’ See (C) 1 of offence number 1.
2.
‘did cause (or permit)’ See (C) 2 of offence number 5.
3.
‘a motor vehicle , namely a…
See (C) 3 of offence number 1.
4.
‘to stand on a road called…
See (C) 4 of offence number I for road.
‘Stand’ is proved by the observations of the officer concerned and although it is not necessary to prove the vehicle had been in the offending position for a particular period of time the court may find it helpful if the officer could give evidence, ‘The vehicle was parked on Bradford Road from 20.00 hours to 21.00 hours etc.’
5.
‘during the hours of darkness’ This point is proved in accordance with local custom if it is found necessary.
Some courts accept the officer's word and some refer to almanacs etc.
6.
‘otherwise than with the left or nearside of the vehicle as close as may be to the edge of the carriageway’.
This point was proved by showing in evidence that the vehicle was the wrong way round, i.e. the offside or right of the vehicle was next to the kerb or that the nearside was not as close as may be to the kerb.
(D) SUPPORTING EVIDENCE
The exceptions to this offence are:
(a)
any motor vehicle when it is being used for fire brigade, ambulance or police purposes or for defence purposes (including civil defence purposes) if compliance with this Regulation would hinder or be likely to hinder the use of the vehicle for the purpose for which it is being used on that occasion
(b)
any motor vehicle standing on a part of a road specially set aside for the parking of vehicles, or as a stand for hackney carriages, or as a stand for public service vehicles, or as a place at which such vehicles may stop for a longer time than is necessary for the taking up and setting down of passengers where compliance with this regulation would conflict with the provisions of any order, regulations or byelaws governing the use of such part of a road for that purpose;
(c)
any motor vehicle waiting to set down or pick up passengers in accordance with regulations made or directions given by the chief officer or police in regard to such setting down or picking up;
(d)
any motor vehicle on any road in which vehicles are allowed to proceed in one direction only; or
(e)
any motor vehicle whilst it is being used in connection with 
(i)
any building operation or demolition;
(ii)
the repair of any other vehicle;
(iii)
the removal of any obstruction to traffic;
(iv)
the maintenance, repair or reconstruction of any road; or
(v)
the laying, erection, alteration or repair in or near to any road of any sewer, or any main, pipe or apparatus for the supply of gas, water or electricity, of any telegraph or telephone wires, cables, posts or supports or of the apparatus of any electric transport undertaking if, in any such case, compliance with this Regulation would hinder or be likely to hinder the use of the vehicle for the purpose for which it is being used on that occasion.
FAIL TO CONFORM TO PELICAN LIGHTS
Regulation 16, Pelican Pedestrian Crossing Regulations and General Directions 1987 and section 25 Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984
(A) POINTS TO PROVE
1.
That you
2.
being the driver of a certain motor vehicle namely a…
3.
did cause the vehicle (or part of the vehicle)
4.
to proceed beyond the stop line of a ‘Pelican’ crossing when the vehicular traffic signal was showing a red light OR
5.
to proceed beyond the red vehicular traffic light signal of a ‘Pelican’ crossing facing the driver on the side of  the carriageway on which the vehicle approached the crossing
6.
there being no stop line visible (or there being no stop line).
(B) MEANING OF TERMS
1.
‘That you ’ Means the identity of the person driving.
2.
‘being the driver of a certain motor vehicle, namely a…’
3.
‘did cause the vehicle (or part of the vehicle)’ Means the vehicle or any part of the vehicle being driven by the offending driver.
4.
‘to proceed beyond the stop line of a ‘Pelican’ crossing when the vehicular traffic signal was showing a red light' 'Proceed beyond' means to pass the prohibited place either with the whole vehicle or a part of the vehicle.
‘Stop line’ is defined as the white line indicating the approach to the crossing which is parallel to the limits of the crossing and on the same side of the crossing as the driver.
‘Pelican crossing’ means a crossing
(a)
at which there are traffic signs of the size, colour and type as prescribed; and
(b)
the presence and limits of which are indicated as prescribed.
‘Vehicular traffic light signal’ is defined as follows: ‘Three lights shall be used, one red, one amber and one green…the lamp showing the amber light shall be capable of showing a steady light or a flashing light such that it flashes at a rate of not less than 70 nor more than 90 flashes per minute etc.
5.
‘to proceed beyond the red vehicular traffic light signal of a ‘Pelican’ crossing facing the driver on the side of the carriageway on which the vehicle was approaching the crossing'  ‘Proceed beyond’, ‘vehicular traffic light signal’and ‘Pelican crossing’are as defined at (B) 4 of this offence.
Generally the rest of this phrase means that the offence is committed if the vehicle or part of it proceeds past the traffic lights on the left or nearside of the approaching vehicle.
6.
‘there being no stop line visible (or there being no stop line)’.
This point means that the stop line has been obliterated by mud, snow or rain etc. or has worn away.
In some cases a stop line may not have been provided.
(C) USUAL METHODS OF PROVING THESE POINTS
1.
‘That you ’ See (C) I of offence number 1.
2.
‘being the driver of a certain motor vehicle , namely a…
See (C) 2 and (C) 3 of offence number 1.
3.
‘did cause the vehicle (or part of the vehicle)’ This point can be proved by the observations of prosecution witness.
4.
‘to proceed beyond the stop line of a ‘Pelican’ crossing when the vehicular traffic signal was showing a red light' As the most common defence to this type of offence is that the lights were still at green it is desirable to prove this point convincingly.
The witness concerned should explain that he had a good unobstructed view of the traffic lights and that they were at red when the vehicle or part of it passed them.
In less than straightforward cases the prosecution should be in a position to prove the delay and times of change of the three coloured lights.
This can be done by timing the sequence with a stop watch (which can itself be proved to have been checked for accuracy if required).
Note that the amber light shall convey the prohibition that  vehicular traffic shall not proceed beyond the stop line etc., except in the case of any vehicle which, when the amber light is first shown, is so close to the said line and signal that it cannot safely be stopped before passing the line or signal.
Consider careless driving in such circumstances.
5
&
6.
This phrase can be proved in a manner similar to (C) 4 of this offence.
(D) SUPPORTING EVIDENCE
Note that this offence does not require a notice of intended prosecution serving on the driver.
According to Regulation 8(2) of these regulations a driver has the overall responsibility to proceed with due regard to the safety of other users of the road subject to the direction of any police constable etc.
DEFECTIVE SIDE LIGHTS
(committed any time) Regulation 23(1) Road Vehicles Lighting Regulations 1989 and section 42(1) Road Traffic Act 1988
(A) POINTS TO PROVE
1.
That you
2.
did use (or cause, or permit to be used)
3.
on a road called..
4.
a certain motor vehicle namely a…
5.
the lighting equipment of which required by these Regulations to be fitted, namely…(here specify)
6.
was not clean and in good working order
7.
during the hours of darkness without contravention of a statutory provision relating to obligatory lamps (or reflectors) and applicable to that vehicle, namely…
(B) MEANING OF TERMS
1.
‘That you ’ Means the identity of the person using the motor vehicle etc.
2.
‘did use (or cause or permit to be used)’ This offence can also be committed when the vehicle is stationary.
3.
‘on a road called…’
4.
‘a certain motor vehicle , namely a…’
5.
‘the lighting equipment of which required by these Regulations to be fitted, namely…(here specify)
This point means that all the statutory provisions regarding obligatory lamps and reflectors, before the vehicle can lawfully be driven, must be complied with.
The most common statutory provisions require two white lights to the front and two red lights and two reflectors to the rear.
6.
‘was not clean and in good working order’ This point means among other things that the lamps in question must be kept clean as mud or snow could hide the light.
The bulb must be in good working order and the wiring must be good, i.e. free from any short circuits or bad earths which could adversely affect the lamp,
7.
‘during the hours of darkness without contravention of a statutory provision relating to obligatory lamps (or reflectors) and applicable to that vehicle, namely…’
‘Hours of darkness’ means the time between half-an-hour after sunset and half-an-hour before sunrise.
Note that justices should ask for evidence of the time of sunset and sunrise where the exact time is in question and that this offence can be committed at any time.
Examples of common contraventions of statutory provisions are shown at point 6 ante .
(C) USUAL METHODS OF PROVING THESE POINTS
1.
‘That you ’ See (C) I of offence number 1.
2.
‘did use (or cause or permit to be used)’ See (C) 2 of offence number 5.
For further information  regarding proving ‘use’ in relation to construction and use offences, see (C) 2 of offence number 19.
3.
‘on a road called…’
4.
‘a certain motor vehicle , namely a…’
See (C) 3 of offence number 1.
5.
‘the lighting equipment of which required by these Regulations to be fitted, namely…(here specify) This point is proved by showing whatever is specified is the lamp or reflector in question, e.g, the obligatory front nearside lamp or the rear offside reflector etc.
6.
‘was not clean and in good working order’ The defect must be described in detail to prove this point, e.g. ‘Both bulbs were blown in the front obligatory lights and two white lights were not being shown to the front’or ‘The rear nearside reflector was broken and part of it was missing, leaving only about a square centimetre of reflective material’etc.
7.
‘during the hours of darkness without contravention of a statutory provision relating to obligatory lamps (or reflectors) and applicable to that vehicle, namely…
‘As this offence can be committed at any time the fact that it was dark at the time could be shown to assist the court in deciding on punishment.
To prove the latter part of this point the offence could be pointed out to the defendant, e.g.’ it is an offence not to be able to show two white lights to the front of your motor car during the hours of darkness'.
(D) SUPPORTING EVIDENCE
Note that this offence does not apply to
(a)
a rear fog lamp on a vehicle which is part of a combination of vehicles any part of which is not required by the Regulations to be fitted with a rear fog lamp;
(b)
a rear fog lamp on a motor vehicle drawing a trailer or
(c)
a lamp, reflector or rear marking which, during daytime  hours is fitted to a combat vehicle.
A ‘combat vehicle’ is a military vehicle used for the carriage of tanks, guns etc.
An offence will not be committed when a defective lamp or reflector is found on a vehicle in use on a road during daytime hours if such a lamp or reflector became defective during the journey which is in progress or if arrangements have been made to remedy the defect with all reasonable expedition.
'Hours of darkness' means the time between half-an-hour after sunset and half-an-hour before sunrise.
The times of sunset and sunrise can be proved by reference to an almanac.
Where the time is crucial to the offence the prosecution should be in a position to be able to prove the actual times in that locality from observations, should they be so required.
OVERTAKING AT A ZEBRA CROSSING
Regulation 10 ‘Zebra’ Pedestrian Crossings Regulation 1971 and section 25 Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984
(A) POINTS TO PROVE
1.
That you
2.
being the driver
3.
of a certain vehicle, namely a…
4.
in a zebra controlled area proceeding towards the limits of an uncontrolled zebra crossing
5.
caused that vehicle (or part of that vehicle)
6.
to pass ahead of the foremost part of another moving motor vehicle, being a vehicle proceeding in the same direction wholly or partly within that area, or
7.
to pass ahead of the foremost part of a stationary vehicle on the same side of the crossing as the approaching vehicle, the stationary vehicle having stopped to accord precedence to a foot passenger
8.
on a road called…
(B) MEANING OF TERMS
1.
‘That you ’ Means the identity of the driver.
2.
‘being the driver ’
3.
‘of a certain vehicle , namely a…’
It is obviously a wider term than motor vehicle as it not only embraces the term motor vehicle but includes a bicycle and other such contraptions which are not propelled by engines.
4.
‘in a zebra controlled area proceeding towards the limits of an uncontrolled zebra crossing’ 'Zebra controlled area' means in relation to a zebra crossing, the area of the carriageway in the vicinity of the crossing and lying on both sides of the crossing or only one side of the crossing, being an area the presence and limits of which are indicated in accordance with schedule 3 (i.e. the general layout of the zig-zag lines, terminal lines where the zig-zag lines begin and give-way lines where the zig-zag lines end next to the crossing).
These markings will still be lawful notwithstanding their imperfection discoloration or partial displacement, provided the general indication of any such line is not materially impaired.
At least one globe at the crossing should show a flashing light for the crossing to be deemed lawful.
The ‘limits’ of the crossing are the alternate black and white stripes of the crossing itself.
‘Uncontrolled zebra crossing’ means a zebra crossing at which traffic is not for the time being controlled by a police constable in uniform or by a traffic warden.
5.
‘caused that vehicle (or part of that vehicle)’ Means the vehicle or any part of the vehicle being driven by the offending driver.
6.
‘to pass ahead of the foremost part of another moving motor vehicle, being a vehicle proceeding in the same direction wholly or partly within that area’ This phrase means that the offending vehicle or part of it must pass ahead of a slower moving motor vehicle travelling  in the same direction.
The vehicle must be going towards the ‘limits’ and also be within or partly within the zig-zag lines, i.e. the ‘zebra controlled area’.
7.
‘to pass ahead of the foremost part of a stationary vehicle on the same side of the crossing as the approaching vehicle, the stationary vehicle having stopped to accord precedence to a foot passenger’ This phrase is the alternative offence to point number 6 and means that the offending vehicle or part of it must pass a stationary vehicle as opposed to a moving motor vehicle in point 6.
But an additional limitation on the offence at point 7 is that the stationary vehicle must have stopped to accord precedence to pedestrians.
Where this is done it matters not that the pedestrians haven't put a foot on the crossing or that they have actually crossed and the offence can still be committed (Gullen v Ford [1975]2 All ER 24 and Connor v Paterson (1977) 121 Sol Jo 392).
8.
‘on a road called…‘
(C) USUAL METHOD OF PROVING THESE POINTS
1.
‘That you ’ See (C) I of offence number 1.
2.
‘being the driver ’ See (C) 2 of offence number 1.
3.
‘of a certain vehicle , namely a…’ 'Vehicle' is proved by describing it in a prosecution witness's statement.
4.
‘in a zebra controlled area proceeding towards the limits of an uncontrolled zebra crossing’ This point is proved by briefly describing the lawful markings etc. of the crossing and pointing out that they were clearly visible and unobscured, by the observation of a prosecution witness regarding the direction of travel of the  offending vehicle and by showing the absence of control at the crossing.
5.
‘caused that vehicle (or part of that vehicle)’ This point can be proved by the observation of a prosecution witness.
6.
This phrase is proved as at point 5, but as the case depends on this point, such evidence is best given by a reliable witness who had a good view of the vehicles concerned.
7.
This alternative offence can also be proved as at point 5 with the additional observations to the effect ‘The stationary vehicle had stopped to accord precedence to foot passengers’.
It might be possible to take a statement from the driver of such a vehicle in cases of difficulty.
8.
‘On a road called…’
This applies to both offences and see offence I (C) 4 for ways to prove this point.
(D) SUPPORTING EVIDENCE
Offences such as reckless driving and driving without due care and attention etc. contrary to Road Traffic Act 1988 sections 2 and 3 respectively can also be considered.
(See offence number 1.)

1.
‘That you ’ Means the identity of the driver.
2.
‘being the driver ’
3.
‘of a vehicle , namely a…’
See (B) 3 of offence number 30.
4.
‘failed to accord precedence to a foot passenger on the carriageway’ This point means that the offending driver did not stop at or before the ‘give-way’line, where provided, which is one metre from the limits of the crossing or at the limits to accord precedence.
The ‘limits’ of a crossing are the alternate black and white stripes of the crossing itself.
Where the foot passenger steps onto the limits before the vehicle reaches them, the driver must accord precedence.
In McKerrel v Robertson [1956]SLT 290 a woman pushing a pram was held to have been one entity and precedence should have been accorded where the pram was on the crossing but the pusher was still on the pavement.
A ‘foot passenger’ has been held to include a person on foot pushing a bicycle when using a zebra pedestrian crossing.
The driver's  duty to accord precedence is absolute except for the circumstances mentioned in Burns v Bidder [1966]3 All ER 29.
Examples include a driver being stung by bees, having an epileptic fit or loss of control because of a latent defect provided the driver did not and could not reasonably be expected to know of the defect.
In the case of a crossing split into two crossings by a central reservation each crossing should be classed as separate crossings.
Therefore, a driver need only accord precedence to pedestrians on the crossing on his side of the road.
5.
‘within the limits of an uncontrolled zebra crossing’ See the last point for the meaning of ‘limits’.
‘Uncontrolled’ means not controlled by a police officer or a traffic warden.
But where the crossing is controlled the offences such as failing to accord precedence and overtaking at a crossing cannot be committed.
6.
‘on a road called…
(C) USUAL METHODS OF PROVING THESE POINTS
1.
‘That you ’ See (C) I of offence number 1.
2.
‘being the driver ’ See (C) 2 of offence number 1.
3.
‘of a vehicle , namely a…’ 'Vehicle' is proved by describing it in a prosecution witness statement.
4.
‘failed to accord precedence to a foot passenger on the carriageway’.
This point is proved by a prosecution witness who is usually a police officer, but sometimes can be a pedestrian who was not accorded precedence.
The officer's evidence will probably be in the following terms: ‘I had a good view of the zebra crossing when I saw a pedestrian step on to the  crossing limits from the footpath outside the Town Hall and walk about one third of the way across the crossing when the defendant drove in front of the pedestrian etc.’
5.
‘within the limits of an uncontrolled zebra crossing’ This point is proved with the last point and mention can be made that the crossing was not controlled.
6.
‘on a road called…’
See (C) 4 of offence number 1.
Crime
WASTING POLICE TIME
Section 5 (2) Criminal Law Act 1967
(A) POINTS TO PROVE
1.
That you
2.
did cause wasteful employment of the police
3.
by knowingly making a false report to…(specify person, not necessarily a constable)
4.
(a)
tending to show that an offence had been committed; or
(b)
to give rise to apprehension for the safety of any person (or property);
(c)
to show that you had information material to a police inquiry.
(B) MEANING OF TERMS
1.
‘That you ’ Means the identity of the person committing the offence,
2.
‘did cause wasteful employment of the police’ This point means that the offender actually caused police time to be wasted in one of the three ways listed at point 4, i.e. falsely reporting a possible offence, danger to a person(s) or property or that the reporter had material information.
3.
‘by knowingly making a false report to…’
This point shows that guilty knowledge must be present.
The offence is not ‘making a false report’, but ‘knowingly making a false report.’
The person to whom the report was made should also be shown to help to establish guilt.
4. (a)
‘tending to show that an offence had been committed, or’ This point includes a conduct such as a straightforward report of a false crime to anyone, but it will usually be  made to a constable, e.g. that a person's car has been stolen or taken without authority or that a house has been burgled.
4. (b)
‘to give rise to apprehension for the safety of any person (or property) or’ False reports that a person is missing from home or that a bomb is in a building (which is more likely to be encountered in practice) come under this point.
Note the offence of making a bomb hoax call etc. under section 51 Criminal Law Act 1977.
There is no requirement for the Director of Public Prosecutions' consent for section 51.
4. (c)
‘to show that you had information material to a police inquiry’.
This point includes a person who falsely reports that he knows who is responsible for a particular crime or where stolen property etc. is hidden.
It is difficult to pinpoint any one category of persons likely to commit this offence as a variety of motives will be involved.
(C) USUAL METHODS OF PROVING THESE POINTS
1.
‘That you’ The identity of the offender can be proved by the person who took the false report stating who he took it from.
Problems might arise when the false report is made via a telephone.
In such cases the witness can try to identify the voice, but the best evidence is an admission by the offender that he was the caller.
2.
‘did cause wasteful employment of the police’.
The police should be in a position to prove how many hours are actually wasted.
The hours can be calculated by totalling all the man hours expended as a result of the false report, e.g. a false report is made by a driver, involved in a hit and run accident, that his car had been stolen and at  the time of the accident it must have been driven by the thief and not himself.
If two constables spent ten hours each investigating the false report before discovering the truth then the total hours wasted would be twenty.
3.
‘by knowingly making a false report to…’(specify person, not necessarily a constable) This point has to be proved and in common with other offences where ‘what a person knows’ has to be proved difficulties can arise.
A judge has said that the state of a man's mind is as much a fact as the state of his digestion.
But unless the defendant admits he knew the report to be false the prosecution will have to rely on circumstantial evidence.
The easiest way to prove this point is to ask a question like ‘Did you know the report you made to…(person's name) was false?’ and if the answer is ‘Yes’then this would be good evidence.
Circumstantial evidence could take the form of showing the defendant wished to cover up an offence committed by himself, such as driving over the prescribed limit, being involved in an accident and then, as mentioned (C) 2 ante alleging that someone else was driving at the time of the accident.
The report need not be made to a constable.
A false report of theft could be made to a next-door neighbour, perhaps to cover up for dealing with property wrongfully, and then the neighbour could make a genuine report to the police about the false theft, thereby causing police time to be wasted.
The neighbour would not be liable for this offence, but the person who made the false report could probably be prosecuted.
4. (a)
‘tending to show that an offence had been committed, or’ This point can be proved by what was said in the report.
The person, who took the report should include the exact words or writing of the report in his evidence and show  that the report tended towards an offence having been committed.
4. (b)
and
(c)
These points can be proved as in 4 (a)ante , with the end result being suitably altered.
(D) SUPPORTING EVIDENCE
This offence cannot be proceeded with except by or with the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions.
Such consent helps to provide uniformity among the police forces when considering prosecuting for an offence which can be committed in so many different ways and for so many different reasons.
2a.
FEAR OR PROVOCATION OF VIOLENCE Section 4(1) Public Order Act 1986
(A) POINTS TO PROVE
1.
That you
2.
did at…
3.
use towards another person
4.
threatening or abusive or insulting words or behaviour or distribute or display to another person any writing, sign or other visible representation, namely…which is threatening abusive or insulting,
5.
with intent to cause that person to believe that immediate unlawful violence would be used against him or another by a person or
6.
to provoke the immediate use of unlawful violence by that person or another or
7.
whereby that person is likely to believe that such violence would be used or it is likely that such violence would be provoked.
(B) MEANING OF TERMS
1.
‘That you ’ Means the identity of the offender.
2.
‘did at…’
The place where the offence was committed should be  inserted here.
Section 4(2) of the Public Order Act 1986 extends the old Section 5 breach of the peace offence by providing: An offence under this section may be committed in a public or a private place, except that no offence is committed where the words or behaviour are used, or the writing, sign or other visible representation is distributed or displayed, by a person inside a dwelling and the other person is also inside that or another dwelling.
‘Dwelling’ means any structure or part of a structure occupied as a person's home or as other living accommodation (whether the occupation is separate or shared with others) but does not include any part not so occupied, and for this purpose ‘structure’includes a tent, caravan, vehicle, vessel or other temporary or movable structure (Section 8).
3.
‘use towards another person’ This phrase means that the threats etc. must be towards another person.
In other words, no offence would be committed if another(s) was (or were) not present who could be abused, insulted or threatened etc.
4.
‘threatening or abusive or insulting words or behaviour or distribute or display to another person any writing, sign or other visible representation, namely…which is threatening, abusive or insulting’ The phrases mean the same as under the old Section 5 Public Order Act 1936.
Threatening, abusive or insulting should be given their ordinary meanings.
Words or behaviour show that the offence can be committed by using words or merely by actions or behaviour.
Distributes or displays to another person any writing, sign or other visible representation, should all be given their ordinary meanings.
This means the giving out or showing any written matter or a sign, e.g. sandwich board, or other visible representation which would threaten, abuse or insult another person.
In practice  it is more common to find the words or behaviour part of the offence being breached rather than the distributing or displaying part.
The whole phrase under this point only creates one offence and Section 7(2) of the 1986 Act provides that for the purposes of the rules against charging more than one offence in the same count or information, each of sections 1 to 5 create one offence.
Therefore, it would be correct to charge ‘using threatening and insulting words and behaviour…’
The mental element or mens rea by the offender for this point is as follows: Section 6(3) provides that a person is guilty of an offence under Section 4 only if he intends his words or behaviour, or the writing, sign or other visible representation, to be threatening, abusive or insulting, or is aware that it may be threatening, abusive or insulting.
This means that the offender's words, behaviour, writing, sign or visible representation must be deliberately threatening, abusive or insulting as opposed to reckless, accidental or blamelessly inadvertent.
If such intent cannot be shown, the awareness part of this mental element definition could be used.
This is easier to prove and would require the subjective examination of the offender by asking questions such as‘Would an offender of the level of his intelligence have been aware?’
5.
‘with intent to cause that person to believe that immediate unlawful violence would be used against him or another by any person’ This means a deliberate frame of mind on the part of the offender to cause a certain belief on the part of the victim.
This is a hard part to prove and where the evidence of intent falls short the point at 7 following, i.e. ‘whereby that person is likely to believe…’ could be charged or reported.
Whether the victim did believe that immediate violence would be used is immaterial so long as the offender intended to cause the victim to have that belief.
Immediate unlawful violence means that circumstances involving delayed violence or lawful violence, such as lawful rugby tackle during a game, would not amount to this offence.
‘Violence’ means any violent conduct, so that 
(a)
except in the context of affray, it includes violent conduct towards property as well as violent conduct towards persons, and
(b)
it is not restricted to conduct causing or intended to cause injury or damage but includes any other violent conduct (for example, throwing at or towards a person a missile of a kind capable of causing injury which does not hit or falls short)(Section 8).
‘Would be used against him or another by any person’ means against the victim or the victim's baby, friend or spouse etc.
The offender need not be the person to offer the violence as a friend of the offender would come within the phrase, ‘by any person’.
6.
‘to provoke the immediate use of unlawful violence by that person or another’ The intent to provoke the immediate use of unlawful violence means an intention by the offender to cause the other party or another to use unlawful violence.
7.
‘whereby that person is likely to believe that such violence would be used or it is likely that such violence would be provoked’.
This is the easier part of the offence to prove.
In the first instance where the police officer dealing with the offender cannot prove an intent, as point 5 above, he should consider this point.
‘Likely to believe’ or ‘likely to be provoked’means, that in the opinion of the police officer and the court, these likelihoods might occur.
Note that for this  part of the offence to be proved neither likelihood need occur.
(C) USUAL METHODS OF PROVING THESE POINTS
1.
‘That you ’.
This point is proved by the officer who arrests the suspect stating that the defendant in court is the person involved.
Any witness could prove this point.
2.
‘did at…
‘The location of the offence can be described in evidence by any witness of the incident to show that it occurred in a public or a private place.
Note the offence cannot be committed inside a dwelling when the other person is inside that or another dwelling.
3.
‘use towards another person’ This can be proved by a civilian witness or a police officer witnessing the incident and describing in his evidence that the threats etc. were towards the other person.
There is no requirement to identify the other person but this may be advantageous in certain circumstances, e.g. when suspected that a defence may be used that there was no other person.
4.
‘threatening or abusive or insulting words or behaviour or distribute or display to another person any writing, sign or other visible representation, namely…which is threatening, abusive or insulting’ The type of actions used by the offender should be explained in the witness statement(s).
The actual words (if any) should be recorded, e.g. You bastard, I'll cripple you here and now'.
The mental element or mens rea under section 6(3) should be considered at this point.
Good questioning is essential to clearly prove an intent or awareness on the part of the offender, e.g. ‘Did you intend to threaten, abuse and insult that person when you said, ‘You bastard, I'll cripple you here and now’?
He replied, ‘No’.
I said, ‘Were you aware that you might threaten, abuse or insult him?’
He said, ‘Yes’.’
5.
‘with intent to cause that person to believe that immediate unlawful violence would be used against him or another by any person’ This point, if used, can be proved by the officer in the case questioning the offender, e.g. ‘Did you want that Notown Football Club supporter to believe that you and your friends were going to hit him?’
He said, ‘Yes, but I wasn't going to hit him’.’
6.
‘to provoke the immediate use of unlawful violence by that person or another’ If this point is charged or reported it may be proved by the officer in the case questioning the offender on the lines of: ‘Did you intend to provoke the Notown football supporters into violence?
He said, ‘Yes, I wanted you lads to catch them at it and arrest them’.’
7.
‘whereby that person is likely to believe that such violence would be used or it is likely that such violence would be provoked’ The officer dealing and/or civilian witnesses could help prove this point by including in their evidence observations such as, ‘The crowd of visiting football supporters were likely to believe they were going to be attacked’, or ‘It was likely that the visiting supporters would lose their tempers and attack the home crowd’.
(D) SUPPORTING EVIDENCE
It was held under the previous law that a police officer could be the ‘other’ person.
In Simcock v Rhodes (1978) 66 Cr App R 192 the court held that an offence was committed where a group of 15 youths told a police sergeant to ‘fuck off’.
2b.
HARASSMENT, ALARM OR DISTRESS Section 5 Public Order Act 1986
(A) POINTS TO PROVE
1.
That you
2.
did at…
3.
use threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour,
4.
or disorderly behaviour, or
5.
display any writing, sign or other visible representation which was threatening, abusive or insulting,
6.
within the hearing or sight of a person
7.
likely to be caused harassment, alarm or distress.
(B) MEANING OF TERMS
1.
‘That you,’ Means the identity of the disorderly person.
2.
‘did at…’
This point means that under Section 5(2) and (3) an offence under this section may be committed in a public or private place, except that no offence is committed where the words or behaviour are used, or the writing, sign or other visible representation is displayed by a person inside a dwelling and the other person is also inside that or another dwelling.
It is a defence for the accused to prove —
(a)
that he had no reason to believe that there was any person within hearing or sight who was likely to be caused harassment, alarm or distress, or
(b)
that he was inside a dwelling and had no reason to believe that the words or behaviour used, or the writing, sign or other visible representation displayed, would be heard or seen by a person outside that or any other dwelling, or
(c)
that his conduct was reasonable.
Note that ‘dwelling’ means any structure or part of a structure  occupied as a person's home or as other living accommodation (whether the occupation is separate or shared with others) but does not include any part not so occupied, and for this purpose ‘structure’includes a tent, caravan, vehicle, vessel or other temporary or movable structure.
3.
‘use threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour’ Threatening, abusive or insulting should be given their ordinary meanings.
Words or behaviour show that the offence can be committed by using words or merely by actions or behaviour.
The whole phrase does not create more than one offence.
Under section 7(2) for the purposes of the rules against charging more than one offence in the same count or information, each of sections 1 to 5 creates one offence.
The mental element or mens rea for this offence is explained in Section 6(4) of the 1986 Act, viz: A person is guilty of an offence under section 5 only if he intends his words or behaviour, or the writing, sign or other visible representation, to be threatening, abusive or insulting, or is aware that it may be threatening, abusive or insulting or (as the case may be) he intends his behaviour to be or is aware that it may be disorderly.
4.
‘or disorderly behaviour’ This point is not defined but it is felt that any conduct which is not orderly and is not covered by ‘threatening, abusive, or insulting words or behaviour’would suffice.
Note the defence where the accused can prove that his conduct was reasonable.
5.
‘displays any writing, sign or other visible representation which was threatening, abusive or insulting’ This point means showing any written matter or other visual matter such as a swastika which would threaten, abuse or insult.
6.
‘Within the hearing or sight of a person’ This point means that the offence must be near enough to another person(s) for it to be heard or seen.
Note the defence shown at point 2 above, when the offender has no reason to believe anyone was within hearing or seeing distances who was likely to be caused harassment, alarm or distress, e.g. if some people could see him, but they were a long way off.
There is a further defence where the accused proves he was inside a dwelling and has no reason to believe his conduct would be heard or seen outside that dwelling or any other dwelling (Section 5(3)).
7.
‘likely to be caused harassment, alarm or distress’ These terms are not defined and the ordinary meaning should be used.
The point means only a likelihood of harassment etc. not an actual harassment.
(C) USUAL METHODS OF PROVING THESE POINTS
1.
‘That you ’ This point is proved by the officer who arrests the suspect stating that the defendant in court is the person involved.
Any witness who saw the offence could prove this point.
2.
‘did at…’
The location of the offence can be proved by the officer in the case to show that the offender could not avail himself of the dwelling defence under section 5(2) and (3).
3.
‘use threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour’ This point is best proved by taking a statement from a witness to say that he felt the words or behaviour were threatening, abusive or insulting.
A judge has said that the ordinary man knows an insult when he sees or hears one.
The mens rea or mental state of the offender must be proved  to show an intent or an awareness that his words or behaviour were threatening, abusive or insulting.
This could be done by questions and answers such as, ‘Did you intend?’ or ‘Were you aware etc.?’
4.
‘or disorderly behaviour’ This point can be proved by a description in the police officer's statement of evidence such as, ‘I saw the accused push into a queue of football supporters’or ‘I saw the accused jumping over flower containers in the Market Place’.
If this point is charged or reported then the accused's mental state or mens rea should be proved, i.e. an intent to be or an awareness that his conduct may be disorderly.
Again such points can best be proved by questioning the offender.
5.
‘displays any writing, sign or other visible representation which was threatening, abusive or insulting’ As pointed out, this part of the offence will be rather rare.
The point can be proved by describing the displaying which may entail seizing the articles concerned.
6.
‘within the hearing or sight of a person’ This can be proved by observing the reactions of passers-by or persons to whom the insults etc. were directed, e.g. ‘I saw two old ladies hurry past looking disgusted and saying, ‘You ought to be locked up’'.
Better proof would be obtained by taking statements from the ‘other’ person(s) to say what they saw or heard.
7.
‘likely to be caused harassment, alarm or distress’.
These new words can be proved by taking statements from an aggrieved person(s) to say how harassed, alarmed or distressed he was.
Where this is not possible the officer dealing could show in his evidence that it was likely that the other party would be harassed, distressed or alarmed.
(D) SUPPORTING EVIDENCE
Note that under (D) of the previous offence, a police officer may be threatened, abused or insulted.
For the purposes of mens rea or the mental state of the accused, where his awareness is impaired by intoxicants he shall be taken to be aware of that which he would have been aware if not intoxicated, unless he shows either that his intoxication was not self-induced or that it was caused solely by the taking or administration of a substance in the course of medical treatment (Section 6(5)).
In subsection (5)‘intoxication’ means any intoxication, whether caused by drink, drugs or other means, or by a combination of means (section 6(6) Public Order Act 1986).

(B) MEANING OF TERMS
1.
‘That you ’ Means the identity of the person exposing himself or herself.
2.
‘did unlawfully, wilfully and’ This point means intentionally as opposed to accidentally and unlawfully as opposed to lawfully such as an artists' model.
3.
‘publicly expose’ Publicly means an exposure which can be seen by more than one person.
Men and women can commit this offence and it need not be in a public place.
4.
‘your naked person’.
Means, in most of the reported cases, the naked penis although it may well be that exposure of the vagina would be within the mischief the offence is trying to prevent.
(C) USUAL METHODS OF PROVING THESE POINTS
1.
‘That you’ Proof of the identity of an accused exposing his/her person may be difficult and apart from an admission a witness is required to say that the man/woman in the court dock is the person who exposed their person.
2.
‘did unlawfully, wilfully and’ This point will depend on the circumstances of each case, but if the accused has done the same act on a number of occasions, if he admits he did it intentionally or if he draws attention to himself etc. then unlawful and wilful conduct may be proved.
3.
‘publicly exposes’ Proof of ‘publicly’is done by showing that the exposure was to more than one person.
4.
‘your naked person’.
Is proved by witness statement(s) showing that the person was not covered.
(D) SUPPORTING EVIDENCE
This offence is rarely used as it can only be tried on indictment.
if the circumstances of the offence constitute a common law public nuisance the Criminal Law Act 1977 allows for trial either way.

with intent to insult a certain female named…
(B) MEANING OF TERMS
1.
‘That you ’ Means the identity of the person exposing himself.
2.
‘did wilfully, openly, lewdly and obscenely’ This point means, without concealment and usually involves an erect penis as opposed to a man merely urinating.
3.
‘expose your person’ Means the penis and no other part of the body will suffice for this offence.
4
‘with intent to insult a certain female named..’
This point means that the accused must have intended to insult a female.
It rules out any accidental exposure and exposing to males.
(C) USUAL METHODS OF PROVING THESE POINTS
1.
‘That you’ See (C) I of offence 3a.
2.
‘did wilfully, openly, lewdly and obscenely’ These terms are proved by a witness stating the penis was exposed openly and not accidently and that it was erect, stiff or swollen etc.
The accused may admit the exposure was wilful etc. verbally and/or by making a statement under caution.
3.
‘expose your person’ This point is proved by describing the penis fully and stating what condition it was in as outlined at point 2 ante .
A married woman usually has no difficulty, but children or young women should be definite in what they have seen.
Such things as fingers, hernias and extended navels have caused problems in practice when the defence has submitted that it was not the penis which was exposed but some other similar looking object.
Note that justices may convict where it can be inferred that at the material time, the penis was exposed.
This is so even when there is no direct evidence that the male organ was seen by a witness.
Hunt v DPP [1990]Crim LR 812.
4.
‘with intent to insult a certain female named…
The intent can best be proved by an admission from the accused or what he said to the female to whom he exposed himself.
Circumstantial evidence can be used and any evidence of similar conduct.
In Perkins v Jeffrey [1915], 5 KB 702 it was said that evidence could be called to prove a similar course of conduct towards other females where a defence of accident or mistake is put forward.

4.
wilfully and indecently
5.
expose your person.
(B) MEANING OF TERMS
1.
‘That you ’ Means the identity of the person exposing himself.
2.
‘did in a certain street called…’
‘Street’ includes any road, square, court, alley and thoroughfares or public passage (section 8 Town Police Clauses Act 1847).
A street is also deemed to be any place of public resort or recreation ground belonging to, or under the control of the local authority and any unfenced ground adjoining or abutting upon any street in an urban district (Section 81 Public Health Acts Amendment Act 1907).
3.
‘to the annoyance of the residents (or passengers)’ 'Annoyance' would seem to be a question of degree for the court to decide.
It would appear that residents live in the street and passengers use the street,
4.
‘wilfully and indecently’ Means wilful as opposed to accidently or mistakenly and against normal standards of decency.
5.
‘expose your person’.
Means exposes the male person.
(C) USUAL METHODS OF PROVING THESE POINTS
1.
‘That you ’ See (C) 1 of offence 3a.
2.
‘did in a certain street called…
‘This point can be proved by the constable dealing with the case describing the place sufficiently for it to come within the definition of ‘street’ at (B) 2 ante .
3.
‘to the annoyance of the residents (or passengers)’ 'Annoyance' can be proved by the person(s) who was exposed to including their feelings of annoyance in their evidence.
Such person(s) should also state whether they were residents or passengers.
4.
‘wilfully and indecently’ 'Wilfully' can be proved from the accused's own admission or from his comments or actions at the time of the  offence.
Indecently can be shown by the penis being erect and any other point that will negate any possible defence of accident or mistake.
5.
‘expose your person’ This point is proved by the person(s) to whom the exposure was made, explaining in detail what they saw etc.
(D) SUPPORTING EVIDENCE
There is no requirement to prove ‘intent to insult a female’ in this offence as there is in the Vagrancy Act offences.
TELEPHONE CALLS — OFFENSIVE ETC.
Section 43(1) Telecommunications Act 1984
(A) POINTS TO PROVE
1.
That you
2.
did send a message by telephone which was grossly offensive, or
3.
send a message by telephone which was of an indecent (or an obscene or a menacing) character or
4.
send a message by telephone (or telegram) to…(specify person) which you knew to be false for the purpose of causing annoyance (or inconvenience or needless anxiety) to the said…(or to…or
5.
persistently make telephone calls without reasonable cause and for the purpose of causing annoyance (or inconvenience or needless anxiety) to…
(B) MEANING OF TERMS
1.
‘That you’ Means the identity of the person making the obscene etc. calls.
2.
‘did send a message by telephone which was grossly offensive, or’ Means the message must have gone by a public telecommunication  service and must be very offensive.
Such calls are usually of an offensive sexual nature, e.g. heavy breathers and also come under point 3, but could be offensive in other ways, e.g. telling a woman that her dead husband was having an affair, was homosexual or had a criminal record etc.
3.
‘send a message by telephone which was of an indecent (or an obscene or a menacing) character or’ Telephone means the same public system as at the alternative point at 2 ante .
Indecent and obscene are usually in the form of heavy breathing, or suggestions or an obscene sexual nature etc.
Menacing calls include threats of violence to the person or property.
4
&
5.
These points are similar to points 2 and 3 ante but vary slightly in the content of the call, e.g. for point 4 examples would include falsely telling a woman her husband was dead or that he is having an affair.
Point 5 includes action such as needlessly ringing a telephone in the early hours of the morning.
(C) USUAL METHODS OF PROVING THESE POINTS
1.
‘That you ’ When the offender is on the other end of a telephone this point is usually difficult to prove.
Apart from an admission, the prosecution have to rely on catching the offender redhanded by keeping observations on a suspect or by British Telecom tracing a persistent caller when he is actually making a call etc.
The recipient could also give evidence that she recognised the voice or tape recorded the offender.
2.
‘did send a message by telephone which was grossly offensive or’ As with the last point the telephone causes problems.
The  receiver of the call could give evidence that the grossly offensive message was received on a public telephone.
3.
‘send a message by telephone which was of an indecent (or an obscene or a menacing) character, or’ This point is proved as the last point with the recipient explaining the indecent, obscene or menacing nature of the call.

&
5.
These points are proved as the last two points.
OFFENSIVE WEAPON
Section 1(1) Prevention of Crime Act 1953
(A) POINTS TO PROVE
1.
That you
2.
without lawful authority or reasonable excuse
3.
had with you
4.
in a public place called…
5.
an offensive weapon namely a…
(B) MEANING OF TERMS
1.
‘That you ’ Means the identity of the person who had the offensive weapon with him.
2.
‘without lawful authority or reasonable excuse’ Lawful authority means the lawful carrying of the weapon such as a policeman's truncheon.
The lawful carrying of something like a car jack which is used to cause injury on the spur of the moment does not necessarily make it an offensive weapon (R. v. 
Dayle [1973]3 All ER 1151).
The prosecution are safer trying to show some interval of time between forming the intent to use the article to injure and the actual use.
Reasonable excuse may be found where a person carries a weapon as self protection from imminent attack (Evans v Hughes [1972]3 All ER 412).
Carrying a knife on the offchance of being attacked, and weapons carried by dance hall security guards have been held not to be a reasonable excuse.
3.
‘had with you’ Means the accused must have known he had the weapon with him (R v Cugullere [1961]2 All ER 343).
Constructive possession, i.e. at his house or any place when the accused is not there, is not sufficient.
4.
‘in a public place called…‘'Public place’ includes any highway and any other premises or place to which at the material time the public have or are permitted to have access whether on payment or otherwise (section 1(4) Prevention of Crime Act 1953).
In R v Mehmed [1963]Crim LR 780 where the accused had an air pistol which he produced in another's private house, it would be reasonable to assume that he must have carried it in a public place to get it there or to take it away.
It was open to the court to make this inference.
5.
‘an offensive weapon namely a…
‘Offensive weapon means any article made or adapted for use for causing injury to the person or intended by the person having it with him for such use by him, or by some other person, per section 1(4) Prevention Of Crime Act 1953 as amended by the Public Order Act 1986 Schedule 2 paragraph 2.
Therefore three categories exist, i.e.
(i)
made;
(ii)
adapted; or
(iii)
intended.
Examples of ‘made’ include a knuckleduster or bayonet.
Examples of ‘adapted’ include a bottle specially.
broken to use as a weapon, or a belt if it has been specially studded for use as a weapon.
Examples of an article ‘intended’ for use as an offensive weapon include a dart which the accused intends to throw in a football crowd or a pocket full of stones which the accused intends to throw at members of a rival demonstration.
An intent to cause injury by shock is sufficient and apparently means the same as an intent to cause injury to the person (R v Rapier [1980]Crim LR 48).
(C) USUAL METHODS OF PROVING THESE POINTS
1.
‘That you ’ Can be proved by the officer dealing with the case proving an admission by the accused that he was the person concerned.
Any witness who saw the incident and could identify the accused could prove this point.
2.
‘without lawful authority or reasonable excuse’ The proof of this point is on the defence and they must prove on the balance of probabilities that the accused had it with him with lawful authority or reasonable excuse.
It is advisable for the prosecution to anticipate any such defence and try to negate any fraudulent defence at the investigation stage.
3.
‘had with you’ This point is proved by the police officer or other witness stating ‘He held the dart in his hand’or ‘The knuckleduster was visible sticking out of his jacket pocket’, etc.
The defence could always allege only a constructive possession and that there was no actual possession in the absence of a witness stating positive actual possession.
4.
‘in a public place called…
‘Proof must be available that the offence occurred at a place coming within the definition at point (B) 4 ante .
Note that the court could infer the accused had been in a public place where no such direct evidence exists.
See point (B) 4,R v Mehmed ,ante .
5.
‘an offensive weapon namely a…
‘Proof of an offensive weapon depends on which of the three categories, outlined at point (B) 5 ante , is used.
If ‘made’ or ‘adapted’is used the prosecution need only prove that the accused had it with him.
They need not prove that the accused had it with him with the intention of using it to cause injury to the person.
This proof is only  required when the ‘intended’ category is used.
Therefore where an otherwise innocent article is concerned it can only become an offensive weapon if the accused intended to use it to cause personal injury.
This can be proved by comments from the accused to the effect ‘I carried it to use in case I was ever attacked’.
The case of R v Dayle outlined at (B) 2 shows that the offence is ‘had with him’ and not ‘picked up on the spur of the moment’.
The prosecution should try to prove an interval of time between forming the intention and using the article to injure when the third category of ‘intended’ is used (Ohlson v Hylton [1975]2 All ER 490).
(D) SUPPORTING EVIDENCE
Flick knives have caused problems when trying to decide whether they are offensive weapons by themselves (with out having to prove the intent of the possessor to use them for causing injury).
The position is now clearer since Gibson v Wales [1983]Crim LR 113.
In this case police officers saw the defendant take a flick knife from his pocket and give it to a friend to inspect before returning it to his pocket.
The police did not prove any intent on the part of the possessor to use it to cause injury.
The Queen's Bench Divisional Court held that a flick knife was an offensive weapon by itself, i.e. made for the purpose of causing injury to the person.
Therefore flick knives are now in the same category as truncheons and knuckledusters.
In practice, although the prosecution can now rely on the mere possession of a flick knife, it would be wise to prove an intent to injure where this is possible.
ASSAULT OCCASIONING ACTUAL BODILY HARM (A.O A BN.)
Section 47 Offences Against the Person Act 1861
(A) POINTS TO PROVE
1.
That you
2.
did assault…(specify person)
3.
thereby occasioning him actual bodily harm.
(B) MEANING OF TERMS
1.
‘That you ’ Means the identity of the accused.
2.
‘did assault…(specify person)’ Assault means an act which intentionally or recklessly causes another person to apprehend immediate and unlawful personal violence (Fagan v Metropolitan Police Commissioner [1968]3 All ER 445).
3.
‘thereby occasioning him actual bodily harm’.
Means any hurt or injury calculated to interfere with the health or comfort of the prosecutor and includes an hysterical or nervous condition resulting from an assault.
Examples of actual bodily harm include minor wounds, sprains, strains and bruises.
An assault causing an hysterical and nervous condition is sufficient (R. v. 
Miller [1954]2 QB 282).
The assault must occasion the bodily harm.
(C) USUAL METHODS OF PROVING THESE POINTS
1.
‘That you’ The identity of the accused can be proved by the evidence of the victim or an admission etc.
2.
‘did assault…
‘Assault is proved by showing the accused's actions come within the definition of assault at (B) 2 ante .
In most cases  there will be physical contact between the accused and his victim and this can be proved by any person who witnessed the offence.
Where an assault cannot be proved, an offence of wounding or inflicting grievous bodily harm contrary to section 20 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 can be considered.
3.
‘thereby occasioning him actual bodily harm’.
This point is proved by describing the injury sustained by the victim, e.g. ‘He had several bruises about 4 cm in diameter on his face’.
Photographic and/or medical evidence could be considered if it is thought that the injuries would be difficult to prove.
The statement made by the victim should also contain a description of the injury,
ASSAULT ON POLICE
Section 51(1) Police Act 1964
(A) POINTS TO PROVE
1.
That you
2.
did assault…(specify officer), a constable of the…
Police Force (or Constabulary)
3.
in the execution of his duty.
(B) MEANING OF TERMS
1.
‘That you ’ Means the identity of the person who assaulted a constable.
2.
‘did assault…(specify officer), a constable of the…
Police Force (or Constabulary)’ Assault means an act which intentionally or recklessly causes another person to apprehend immediate and unlawful personal violence (Fagan v Metropolitan Police Commissioner [1968]3 All ER 445).
3.
‘in the execution of his duty’ Means duties connected with protecting life and property, preventing and detecting crime and keeping the peace.
The constable must not be exceeding his authority, such as detaining a person without a power of arrest.
He must not act unlawfully in other ways such as remaining on premises after being lawfully requested to leave.
(C) USUAL METHODS OF PROVING THESE POINTS
1.
‘That you ’ Can be proved by the officer who has been assaulted giving evidence of identification.
2.
‘did assault…(specify officer) a constable of the…
Police Force (or Constabulary)’ Assault must be proved in accordance with the definition at point (B) 2 ante .
In most cases the accused will strike the officer who should describe the assault in detail.
Photographs can be considered in cases where problems are foreseen.
3.
‘in the execution of his duty’.
Can be proved by describing the duty being performed, e.g. ‘I said to John Brown ‘You are being arrested for conduct likely to cause a breach of the peace’ and was just about to hold his arm and caution him when he struck me in the face with his left fist etc.’
If there is any doubt about being able to prove this point successfully the prosecution should consider other offences.
Where any actual bodily harm is occasioned section 47 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 may be appropriate (see offence 6 ante ).
Sections 18 and 20 of the same Act can also be considered where there is a wounding or grievous bodily harm.
(D) SUPPORTING EVIDENCE
Note the offence of assaulting a person assisting a constable.
OBSTRUCTING POLICE
Section 51(3) Police Act 1964
(A) POINTS TO PROVE
1.
That you
2.
did wilfully obstruct (or resist)…a constable of the…
Police Force (or Constabulary)
3.
acting in the execution of his duty.
(B) MEANING OF TERMS
1.
‘That you ’ Means the identity of the person obstructing the police.
2.
‘did wilfully obstruct (or resist)…a constable of the…
Police Force (or Constabulary)’ Wilful obstruction means a deliberate, intentional act which makes it more difficult for the policeman to carry out his duty.
Examples include warning someone so as to render police investigation fruitless (Hinchcliffe v Sheldon [1955]1 WLR 1207) and drinking alcohol after driving to frustrate the breath test procedure (Ingleton v Dibble [1972]1 QB 480).
3.
‘acting in the execution of his duty’ See (B) 3 of offence number 7.
(C) USUAL METHODS OF PROVING THESE POINTS
1.
‘That you ’ The officer obstructed should give evidence to identify the accused.
2.
‘did wilfully obstruct (or resist)…a constable of the…
Police Force (or Constabulary)’ This point can be proved by the officer concerned describing the obstruction in detail, e.g. ‘I saw John Jones signal to several car drivers to reduce their speed before passing  the police operated speed check’etc.
Care should be taken by the prosecution to show the obstruction was deliberate and intentional to negate any defence of accident or mistake.
3.
‘acting in the execution of his duty’ See (C) 3 of offence number 7.
(D) SUPPORTING EVIDENCE
Note the offence of obstructing someone assisting a constable.
INDECENT ASSAULT ON WOMAN
Section 14(1) Sexual Offences Act 1956
(A) POINTS TO PROVE
1.
That you
2.
did indecently
3.
assault…
4.
a woman (or girl under the age of 16 (or 13) years).
(B) MEANING OF TERMS
1.
‘That you ’ Means the identity of the person indecently assaulting the woman or girl.
2.
‘did indecently’ 'Indecent' means any affront to modesty, usually touching a female's private parts, but less obvious acts include a kiss followed by a suggestion concerning intercourse.
To place a finger into the vagina of a girl under 16 years is an indecent assault as there can be no consent to indecent assault under 16 years (R v McCormack [1969]2 QB 442).
3.
‘assault…
‘Means an act which intentionally or recklessly causes another person to apprehend immediate and unlawful personal violence (Fagan v Metropolitan Police Commissioner [1968]3 All ER 445).
Note that a hostile touching can be an assault and battery.
4.
‘a woman (or girl under the age of 16 (or 13) years)’.
This means that if ‘under 13 years’ is charged, the punishment is greater and the offence becomes an arrestable offence.
If under 16 years, consent to the assault is no defence.
(C) USUAL METHODS OF PROVING THESE POINTS
1.
‘That you ’ Is proved by the victim giving evidence of identification.
Such evidence as saliva and seminal fluid tests, footprints or fingerprints may be helpful.
Note that although not required in law, corroboration of the victim's evidence is looked for in practice.
Therefore the prosecution should try to provide corroboration for her allegation at the investigation stage, even regarding the accused's identity (R v Midwinter (1971) 55 Cr App R 523).
2.
‘did indecently’ The indecent act must be described by the victim in her evidence.
Any conversation with or comments made by the accused may help to prove his actions were prompted by an indecent motive.
3.
‘assault…’
Assault must be proved to fall within the definition at (B) 3 ante .
There will normally be a hostile touching but in the case of R v Rolfe (1952) 36 Cr App R 4 a man was convicted of indecent assault without touching the victim.
He exposed himself in a railway carriage and moved towards the victim, inviting her to have connections with him.
4.
‘a woman (or girl under the age of 16 (or 13) years)’.
Ages can sometimes be difficult to prove, but most courts accept a birth certificate.
If problems are anticipated a  statement from someone who witnessed the birth is good evidence.
A bona fide belief that the victim was 16 or over when the indecent assault took place will not amount to a defence (R v Maughan (1934], 24 Cr App R 130).
(D) SUPPORTING EVIDENCE
(a)
Corroboration is looked for in practice and the following circumstances will usually amount to corroboration:
(i)
evidence of contact between the accused and the victim on their bodies and clothing:
(ii)
the distressed condition of the victim(iii) evidence of similar misconduct can be admitted as corroboration if from an independent source;
(iv)
the sworn evidence of a child victim can be corroborated by the evidence of another child victim of similar misconduct.
The early complaint of the victim will provide good evidence of credibility but will not amount to corroboration unless an independent source is involved.
(b)
Where the accused invites a woman to touch him indecently there can be no offence as there is no assault.
But consider the Indecency with Children's Act 1960 for children under 14 years who are so invited.
SOLICITING FOR PROSTITUTION
Section 1 Street Offences Act 1959
(A) POINTS TO PROVE
1.
That you
2.
being a common prostitute
3.
did loiter (or solicit)
4.
in a street (or public place) called…
5.
for the purpose of prostitution.
(B) MEANING OF TERMS
1.
‘That you’ Means the identity of the person loitering or soliciting.
2.
‘being a common prostitute’ Prostitution is not confined to sexual intercourse.
A woman who offers her body commonly for any lewd act for reward is a common prostitute.
This includes a woman who merely masturbates her clients (R v Webb [1964]1 QB 357).
Before being charged with being a common prostitute, loitering or soliciting etc. the police should first caution the woman on two occasions for loitering or soliciting etc.
The caution should be entered in the appropriate register of cautions.
A detailed description of the woman and all other means of identifying the woman in the future should be noted as prostitutes frequently change their names and appearances.
3.
‘did loiter (or solicit)’ Loiter means passing frequently at a slow speed (Williamson v Wright 1924 SLT 363).
Solicit means to invite entice, appeal to, or request another person.
An advertisement or notice board is not soliciting as the presence of the prostitute is required (Burge v Director of Public Prosecutions [1962]1 All ER 666 and Weiss v Monahan [1962]1 All ER 6–64).
A person who is in a street or public place can be solicited by a prostitute who is on a balcony or at a window (Smith v Hughes [1960]2 All ER 859).
4.
‘in a street (or public place) called…‘'Street’ is defined at section 1(4) Street Offences Act 1959 as any bridge, road, lane, footway, subway, square, court, alley or passage, whether a thoroughfare or not, which is for the time being open to the public, and the doorways and entrances of premises abutting on a street (as herein before defined) and any ground adjoining and open to a street, shall form part of the street.
‘Public place’ has been held to include a field used by the public on one day only; a racecourse enclosure where there was a right to exclude  people and charge for admission; and an inn car park.
The cases concerned are R v Collinson (1931) 23 Cr App R 49,Glynn v Simmonds [1952]2 All ER 47 and Elkins v Cartlidge [1947]1 All ER 829 respectively.
5.
‘for the purpose of prostitution’ Means that loitering or soliciting must be for the purpose of offering her body etc. for reward as outlined at point 2 ante .
(C) USUAL METHODS OF PROVING THESE POINTS
1.
‘That you ’ This point can be proved by the police officer who arrested (or occasionally reports) the prostitute, identifying her to the court.
2.
‘being a common prostitute’ Proof of this point must be available to negate any defence of accident or mistake, e.g. ‘That I was waiting for my boy friend or taxi etc.’
The proof usually takes the form of quoting previous convictions, cautions and other relevant antecedent history to the court, where she denies on oath being a common prostitute.
The officer(s) who actually cautioned her may be required to prove such caution(s) to the court.
3.
‘did loiter (or solicit)’ Two police officers will keep observations for prostitutes and to prove this point their evidence should contain words to the effect that ‘the accused walked slowly up and down High Street five times stopping and talking to several men.
As a result of what one of the men (the witness) John Smith said to me I spoke to the accused etc.’
Here the prostitute both loiters and eventually solicits when she speaks to a client.
Proof of soliciting is the actual conversational meeting with a client.
Usually in practice only  one of the charges is preferred, i.e. loitering (over a period of time) or soliciting (usually a verbal invitation).
4.
‘in a street (or public place)’ This point is proved by naming the street and in nine times out of ten will cause no problems.
But in cases of doubt the definition at point (B) 4 should be consulted and the particular place proved by describing how the place comes within the definition.
5.
‘for the purpose of prostitution’ This point must be carefully proved to eliminate any risk of charging an innocent woman who was merely asking the way or for a light etc.
Good evidence would consist of an incriminating statement taken from a prospective client or an offer to do ‘business’ with a plain-clothed policeman.
TAKING CONVEYANCE WITHOUT AUTHORITY
Section 12(1) Theft Act 1968
(A) POINTS TO PROVE
1.
That you
2.
did, without having the consent of the owner or other lawful authority,
3.
take a certain conveyance, namely a…
4.
for your own use (or for the use of…).
(B) MEANING OF TERMS
1.
‘That you ’ Means the identity of the person taking the conveyance.
2.
‘did, without having the consent of the owner or other lawful authority’ Means that this offence is not committed if the accused believed that he had lawful authority to do it or that he  would have had the owner's consent if the owner knew of his doing it and the circumstances of it.
In practice this defence is not often put forward.
‘Other lawful authority’ includes such things as the police moving a vehicle causing an obstruction.
‘Owner’ includes a person possessing the conveyance as a result of a hiring agreement or a hire-purchase agreement.
3.
‘take a certain conveyance, namely a…’ 'Take' means some movement of the conveyance intending to put the conveyance into motion (Blayney v Knight [1975]Crim LR 237).
‘Conveyance’ means any conveyance construed or adapted for the carriage of a person or persons whether by land, water or air, except that it does not include a conveyance constructed or adapted for use only under the control of a person not carried in or on it, and ‘drive’shall be construed accordingly.
As the essence of this offence is stealing a ride, handcarts and pedestrian controlled vehicles etc. are not conveyances as they are designed for use only under the control of a person not carried in or on it.
Pedal cycles are not included under section 12(1) but are specially dealt with under section 12(5).
4.
‘for your own use (or for the use of…)’
Means that a ‘use’ must be obtained.
For example where the handbrake of a motor car is released and the car is allowed to run down a hill by itself the offence under section 12 would not be committed as it was not for his or another's use.
(C) USUAL METHODS OF PROVING THESE POINTS
1.
‘That you ’ Is normally proved by the officer who saw the defendant driving etc., or another witness who can swear the defendant  was driving etc. or by the defendant's admission.
2.
‘did without having the consent of the owner or other lawful authority’ When the complainant's statement is obtained it should include the point that the person concerned had not got his (the owner's) consent to take the conveyance.
3.
‘take a certain conveyance namely a…’
In the majority of cases the conveyance will be a motor car and the ‘taking’ is proved by a witness stating that he saw the defendant take the car, or by an admission to that effect by the defendant.
Only the slightest movement need be proved but in practice the car will probably have travelled several miles.
‘Conveyance’ can be proved by describing the thing concerned and in cases of difficulty by showing that it comes within the definition of a conveyance as shown as B (3)ante .
4.
‘for your own use (or for the use of…’
The normal ‘use’ is to go for a joyride, to get home after missing the last bus or train or for the use in crime.
The fact that it was used for his or another's use could be established by questions and answers between the police and the defendant.
(D) SUPPORTING EVIDENCE
A consent obtained by a false statement as to the destination or the purpose of the journey is still valid (R. v Peart [1970]2 All ER 823).
The second half of section 12(1) deals with persons who knowing that a conveyance has been taken without authority, drives it or allows himself to be carried in or on it.
BURGLARY — COMMITTING THEFT HAVING ENTERED
Section 9(1) (b) Theft Act 1968
(A) POINTS TO PROVE
1.
That you
2.
did, having entered
3.
a certain building (or part of a certain building) namely…
4.
as a trespasser,
5.
did steal therein (specify)…
(B) MEANING OF TERMS
1.
‘That you ’ Means the identity of the burglar.
2.
‘did, having entered’ Means that an effective and substantial entry has been made (R v Collins [1972]2 All ER 1105).
An entry can be made by any part of the accused's body or by an instrument held by the accused to intimidate someone in the building or to remove goods from the building.
An entry cannot be made by an instrument used to make an entry such as a key or piece of wire used to pull back internal bolts.
It is submitted that whether or not an entry has been made is a question of fact for the jury to decide.
3.
‘a certain building (or part of a certain building) namely…’
Building means a substantial, permanent structure, usually constructed of brick, stone or wood or any combination of them which has walls and a roof.
Again, this issue is one of fact for the jury, not one of law.
Inhabited vehicles or vessels are included e.g. houseboats or caravans even if the inhabitant is not there (section 9(3) Theft Act 1968).
‘Part of a building’ will include entering a building lawfully but then going into a part of the building as a trespasser, such as entering the private quarters in a public house which was entered lawfully in the first instance or going behind an unattended counter in a shop.
4.
‘as a trespasser’ Means an intentional entry, whether reckless or negligent, into a building which is in possession of another who does not consent to the entry.
The accused must know he is a trespasser or be reckless to that fact.
Bogus officials, who gain entry fraudulently, would still be trespassers.
5.
‘did steal therein (specify)…’
Means steal anything contrary to sections I to 6 of the Theft Act 1968.
See offence 13 of this section.
(C) USUAL METHODS OF PROVING THESE POINTS
1.
‘That you ’ Apart from being caught in the act, when the burglar may be identified by the witness concerned, forensic evidence sometimes helps to prove identity.
Fingerprints, fibres of clothing, footprints or gloveprints etc. could be used where appropriate.
2.
‘did, having entered’ In the majority of burglaries this point should not be difficult to prove and a line in a witness statement to the effect ‘I saw James Stewart enter the house’, would suffice.
In the case of instruments proof of the accused's intent when entering the building with the instrument would be required, i.e. was the instrument only used to gain entry (no entry) or was it used to intimidate or to steal goods?
(When there would be an entry.)
3.
‘a certain building (or part of a certain building) namely…’
A description of the building concerned in a witness statement would be sufficient proof of this point.
Generally burglaries involve dwelling houses, warehouses, schools, shops etc.
4.
‘as a trespasser’ A sentence in the complainant's statement such as‘This  is my house and James had no right or authority to enter’, is normally sufficient.
5.
‘did steal therein (specify)…
‘A theft must be proved.
(See offence 13 of this section for such advice.)
THEFT
Sections 1 to 7 Theft Act 1968
(A) POINTS TO PROVE
1.
That you
2.
did steal…(specify property) of the value of…
3.
the property of…
(B) MEANING OF TERMS
1.
‘That you ’ Means the identity of the person who stole the property.
2.
‘did steal…(specify property) of the value of…
‘Steal means
(i)
dishonestly
(ii)
appropriates
(iii)
property
(iv)
belonging to another
(v)
with the intention of
permanently depriving the other of it.
(i)
‘Dishonestly’ generally means without a claim of right made in good faith.
It will not be dishonest where the accused believes he had a right in law to the property or that he would have the other's consent to take the property.
(ii)
‘Appropriates’ means any assumption of the rights of an owner and includes coming by property without stealing it but later assuming the rights of ownership.
For example, a boy under 10 years, the age of criminal responsibility, took his friend's bicycle home and gave it to his father.
Although the father came by the bicycle innocently, if he assumes the rights of an owner by selling it, for instance, he will steal it.
(iii)
‘Property’— what is stolen must come within the definition of property viz: money and all other property, real or personal, including things in action and other intangible property.
There are exceptions to this definition concerning land, mushrooms, plants and wild creatures.
(iv)
‘Belonging to another’ briefly means belonging to someone having possession or control of the property.
Possession includes a constructive possession as well as actual possession.
A person can have possession or control of property without knowing of its existence (R v Woodman [1974]2 All ER 955).
(v)
‘With the intention of permanently depriving the other of it’ briefly means treating the property as his own regardless of the other's rights, e.g. giving the property away, selling it, or painting it, etc.
An intent to temporarily deprive is not sufficient.
3.
‘the property of…
‘Means as 2 (iv)ante , the person having possession or control of the property,
(C) USUAL METHODS OF PROVING THESE POINTS
1.
‘That you ’ Is usually proved by someone witnessing the theft, but can be proved by fingerprints, an admission by the accused, being found in possession of the stolen property, and by the use of a variety of technical aids such as a concealed camera.
2.
‘did steal…
‘Proof of the five parts of stealing will be dealt with as follows:
(i)
dishonestly
(ii)
appropriates
(iii)
property
(iv)
belonging to another
(v)
with the intention of permanently depriving the other of it.
(i)
‘Dishonestly’ is proved by the person to whom the  property belonged stating that ‘No person had any right or authority to take the property’.
(ii)
‘Appropriates’ is generally proved by a witness stating that the accused picked the property up or put it in a shopping bag or a pocket.
If the accused was not seen to take the property such evidence as him being seen near the scene of the crime or being found in possession of the property is useful.
As appropriates involves assuming the rights of an owner the interview between the police officer in the case and the accused can be important.
It can help to show his motive or state of mind if carefully worded questions are put to the accused.
(iii)
‘Property’ is proved in most cases by describing it in the statement of the person to whom it belongs or in the police officer's statement.
In most cases it will be personal or in other words movable property.
(iv)
‘Belonging to another’ is proved by showing that the property was appropriated from someone having possession or control of it, e.g. the owner or tenant etc. of a dwelling house would have possession and control of all the personal property in the house, and the owner or driver of a car would have possession or control of the contents of the car.
A sentence in the loser's statement to the effect that ‘the last time I saw my watch was when I put it in my locker at work’ or ‘I placed my purse in my shopping basket’shows that he had possession or control of the property,
(v)
‘With the intention of permanently depriving the other of it’.
In order to prove this intent it must be shown that the accused meant to treat the property as his own.
In practice the following examples would probably show this intent:
(a)
A shoplifter placing goods in his pocket or shopping bag where wire baskets are provided.
It is safer and more  conclusive to let the shoplifter pass through any cashout without paying;
(b)
a burglar leaving premises with property;
(c)
a car thief who alters registration plates or the colour; or
(d)
a pickpocket running off with the victim's wallet and money.
The accused's intentions are best proved from any admission he makes when interviewed by the police.

‘the property of…’
This point is proved as at (C) 2 (iv)ante .
(D) SUPPORTING EVIDENCE
Where a person is found in possession of recently stolen property it can be presumed by the court that he stole it, in the absence of a satisfactory explanation.
