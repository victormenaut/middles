Well James , what can I do for you tonight?
It's  my knee again.
Your knee?
Still giving you trouble Jim?
Aye.
That's a boy, let's have a wee look at it.
See how we're doing.
Did you get X-rays, Jim?
Aye, for  and I still didn't, they didn't show anything.
There's no arthritis or anything?
Good.
That's good.
No there's no  that other thing  the inhaler thing.
Mm.
No sign of any damage with that.
Now then, where, where are you feeling it catching just now?
Here and
Still round there.
this  up here, and, and there's kind of er shooting pains  and
Still a bit puffy down here, isn't it, eh?
That bit doesn't feel so bad.
Mm.
Remember there was we though we thought there 
Aye, a s 
was a wee
scar.
scar across there.
You can still feel a slight  have you been doing your exercises?
No?
Right.
Well, I think you're at the stage now where we could get you doing your exercises, Jim.
It's at, you can feel the slight  in there 
Ah.
Just there , you can feel that, feel that, feel it catching.
But that's softer than it was before.
So that's good.
Now, what we'll need to get you doing, is some exercise to strengthen up the muscle across there.
And pull that scar  tight together Jim.
What, what I want you to do is, just with you sitting just now, just lift your leg up like that, just hold it with your two hands.
And just  do that.
About twenty times a day.
Now your knee'll be sore, when you start doing it, because you, this muscle has to get strengthened up again.
And let that scar get joined up.
But as you keep doing that, every day, it'll get less and less and less painful.
And after about a week, there'll be no pain in it, and you'll be  doing it no bother at all.
And that muscle'll grow over the top of that scar, and it'll get rid of all that for you Jim.
Okay.
Well that's so as you're, you're going to win after all.
You're going to win.
Er, what about the inhalers now, are you still?
Er could I  erm have a prescription for ?
Aye, sure.
I'm still on the  forty.
The be you still on that?
Do you need them?
No, that's just
No, you're all 
it's just I don't have any Ventolin.
Right.
Now then, if you do these wee exercises Jim and then come back up and see me in  about  f say four weeks.
Let's say four weeks.
Okay.
And we'll just check that out again, and make sure that that's all got healed over.
You're at number two?
Yes  number two   You haven't gone and left home since I saw you last, no?
No.
You're still at ?
But that's good, I'm  pleased.
That's   Well, that's since January.
Aye.
It's been really slow.
Cos yeah, er, it er it does worry you.
And er if we can get it to just, well a wee bit of rest, we get to the stage where it er starts to get soft again.
It means we can get the muscle to  grow over the top and bury that underneath and let the whole thing get back to normal.
Okay.
But just nice gentle exercises.
No leaping up and down .


Eh?
Okay?
Yeah.
just do it nice and gently and that'll come back to normal.
Right thanks Doctor.
Okay.
Thanks.
Right.
Bye.
Okay John Cheerio now.
