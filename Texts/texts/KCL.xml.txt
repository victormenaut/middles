What do you get the headphones for as well?
I don't know.
He didn't seem to know what they were in there for.
Oh.
Well you can listen to what you've taped with the headphones.
What?
You can listen to what you've taped.
Oh  
You can play it back yeah, if you want to.
Oh.
I notice if you put the  the headphones in  it would erm  you'd maybe be listening to it as it's taping?
I don't think you can do that.
Did you have to sign for something to say that you've had it?
To say I've had it, yeah.
Yeah.
When's he coming back?
Next Friday.
Next Friday, oh right.
And is that the microphone?
Yes.
And are you supposed to wear that?
Er stick it in your t wherever, yeah.
In your 
Stick it where you like.
, you what?
Stick it where you like.
But d does it need to be uncovered?
No.
It's got erm  it's own recording level.
Yeah.
And even if it  and are you supposed to tell people that you're recording what they're saying or just record it 
Erm 
and then tell them afterwards?
I suppose you should tell them that you're going to tape the conversation maybe, yeah.
Yes.
I don't suppose that matters really.
But I mean, if you erm  if you put your headphones on you see, they might just think erm  you're listening to a Walkman.
And er  they would come up with some bad language towards you.
Then especially if you told them you were recording what they  said .
Could be dangerous.
I've asked Brian to take the dog out as well, when he comes back.
I won't have time now.
No.
And I'm going to Chester tomorrow.
Are you?
Yeah.
Ah!
Didn't I tell you about that?
There's no petrol in the car.
You mean  every time I have that car I have to put petrol in.
No I put it in the last two times.
Twenty quid's worth.
So you'll have  you watch my little car.
Watch it or wash it?
Watch it.
Be careful.
I'll be very careful with your little car John.
Well it's not far to Chester.
It's not as far to Chester as it is to Swansea is it?
I don't suppose it is.
Mm?
No.
Go the motorways though, if you can.
Oh.
You'll have to watch for, for the roadworks.
I mean the roadworks on the M 6 are diabolical now.
Mm.
I it took us three and a half hours coming back from Swansea.
But we stopped off for half an hour as well.
And  I think it's longer coming back that way.
Over the bridge.
No it isn't.
It isn't.
You sure?
I'd be positive.
Shorter.
Cos  th I remember the first time I went down that way over the bridge.
It was about a hundred and eighty miles I clocked up.
Er but coming back I only clocked up about a hundred and twenty.
What was the mileage when we got there?
A hundred and eleven?
Something like that, yeah.
So it was three hundred coming back or  total three hundred.
I can't remember now exactly.
I I think it does make a difference, going over the bridge.
I I found it when I was driving the last time.
But I couldn't remember where the turn off was  to come up the scenic route.
Cos I was reading, and you'd passed it.
Yeah well you could erm  go up, go down the M 50  into Ross and then go from there.
Yeah but th there was a turn off  and I didn't know whether the turn off was at Cardiff  and we went past it.
Yeah, there is a  oh to go back that way?
Yeah.
Yeah.
You could turn off for Abergavenny again.
Abergavenny yeah, but that was, that was  going straight up
So, where's she gone now?
Who, Patricia?
Well, she was going to Birmingham and then she was going to  in a careers office.
They close at about four o'clock don't they?
Yeah, very probably.
And  she was hoping that they would have sent her for an interview  down there.
In the afternoon.
Think she's probably staying in Birmingham.
Well, Birmingham's on the cards cos Steve, Stevey-boy works there doesn't he?
Pardon me?
What?
Food.
Come on Brian and get in the shopping.
Food food food food food food 
How's Brian?

Glorious food.
no doubt.
Oy.
Your dinner's on top of the cooker.
Plate might be hot.
Eh!
Who's got a Walkman?
Me.
How come?
A bloke give me one.
Told you we should have let him in.
Oh it's got a microphone as well.
Yeah.
It's on at the moment.
Recording?
Oh I see.
Why's that?
Oh  some experiment?
Right.
Some market research just to see how many times you swear  at me.
Really?
Yeah.
Oh that's good.
So there will be er
plenty on it.
We should win any competitions then.
Hands down I think.
I can't eat any more of that.
Macaroni cheese?
Mm.
Hey.
It tastes alright for a few mouthfuls and then it like gets a bit monotonous.
I've just been up to Tesco's.
Mm?
Who were you talking to?
I was talking to er  Simon and Dave and  all the rest of the lads 
Yeah.
Bragging about your bike.
And er, no actually.
Dave goes  have you got your bike yet?
I goes yeah, just been to pick it up.
He goes  oh and I suppose you loved every minute of it?
What's that grey thing John?
Has it fallen off the roof?
Ooh.
What's what?
That grey thing on the ground.
Oh yeah.
It's off the erm
Flue?
No, it's off 
Vent?
It's off the toilet erm
The vent.
the vent.
Oh I'll pop back out there.
I'll put it in the garage.
We won't lose it then.
It just slides on.
But the wind licked it off I suppose.
I'm definitely not putting it back on today, but I will put it back on .
Well 
Do you know that chap two doors down with the B M W?
Mm.
The wind set his alarm off.
Really?
Mm.
On his car?
Shook it?
Yeah.
Mm, must be very sensitive.
Upstairs, on the bed, vaseline on your nose.
Now.
Move it.
How much did my shopping come?
Go on.
Eight pound seventy.
Go upstairs.
Oh that was good.
Hurry up.


What?
He's going as well.
He's gone.
He goes  upstairs, on the bed, vaseline on your nose go on.
And he's gone up.
I think he's getting hooked on the taste of vaseline, that dog.
Yeah.
    
So it's I'm gonna pop round to Matt's tonight.
Who's Matt?
Matt .
Where's he live?
Bromsgrove.
Mm.
He the one with the bike?
Yeah.
The one that dropped out of college?
Work.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well  I'll ring him up.
See if he's in.
You mean you're not going to show off to John ?
Oh yeah.
I'm gonna call for him on the way.
Does he know Matt?
No.
I seen Andy in town today walking round with his erm  headphones in.
Oh yeah.
Mm.
That tasty?
It is actually.
It's a bit big though.
Well  John demolished my little omelette pan.
Oh I see.
Mm.
So I had to use his frying pan.
Rick.
Let's have a look at your face.
Oh nice.
Did you get vaseline on?
Mm.
Oh, yeah  I've got some now.
Did you get your vaseline on Rick?good boy.
I wonder if these people that have to listen to these tapes can understand doggy language as well?
No.
No?
What do you think Rick?
Did John tell you anybody that takes part will get erm  a Marks and Spencers' voucher?
Oh?
Mm.
Wonder if we'll get any, any vouchers for the dog?
In the pet food shop.
He makes enough noise doesn't he?
Yeah, yeah.
It was also noted today  at these er presentations that I was the one with the least Brummie accent.
Oh.
Which made me feel good.


Well  except for Andy.
Mm we oh yeah Andy's  Nigerian.
The Nigerian.
Mm.
Yeah.
Except for him of course, but  Cos  I was getting a bit upset that my voice was going a bit  Brummie.
Oh right.
I've given her her hairdryer back  on trial, I've told her.
If she leaves it plugged in and switched on again  she won't get it back.
Yeah.
She's definitely unplugged the hairdryer and she's unplugged her radio as well.
Because it ain't on.
I ain't having the house burnt down.
Bloody hairdryers.
Well  want to know  if Rick joins in the conversation will we get any vouchers for doggy food?
Yeah, we do don't we?
Yeah we do.
You are cheeky.
What about her food?
Tell Mary.
Tell Mary all about it.
I don't want to know about it Rick.
Well who, who noticed that you had the least Brummie accent?
The instructors
Oh.
and all the other lads.
Oh right.
Did they record it or that, no?
Which is a good job.
Mm.
Cos most of us were petrified anyway.
And that's a bit like that erm  the teaching skills that I had to do that time when I was on the course.
Mm?
Erm  and I had to think up  something  that I do as a hobby er to teach other people.
I, I did those little flowers you see  and took them in.
And er  it is quite nervewracking really to sit there.
Specially when the instructors come over and they're sort of sitting watching as well.
Well  the bad thing was, as soon as I picked my cards up I dropped them all  you know?
Mm.
All your flash cards?
Good morning yeah.
Good morning ladies and gentlemen pshoow and they, they went all over the place.


So I had to pick them back up  mm sorry.
Bit of nerves.
Be back to front now, this morning yeah?
John wants me to er  sew his trousers for him.
Oh.
I'm waiting on him  picking up the machine.


It tickles me the way they call it portable and you can hardly lift it.
we took Patricia in to, we give her a lift as far as Longbridge today.
She was going back to get her coat changed.
And then she was going to the careers office.
And erm they were going to send her for an interview straight away.
I told her to be home reasonably early but she's not home yet.
Well 
not far 
I know.
Don't let it beat you.
I dunno mum.
Only a little omelette.
Yeah but it was bigger than the plate.


You had to fold it in half to get it on.
That's what I said to John I said you've got your dinner in between an omelette.
Yeah.
That's right.
I thought I could call it erm  a Spanish omelette.
What I tried to do was one of those 
Did you have 
ploughman's things.
did you have a surplus of eggs or something?
Pardon me.
Well  erm, I knew you wouldn't eat sort of sliced ham on its own with erm  vegetables.
So  I knew you would eat it like that in an omelette.
Mm.
I mean, if it had of been smaller.
Well, I'll have a go but  I may not eat all this but  if it was smaller it's really tasty as well.
Mm.
But you liked those erm  were they countryman's or ploughman's in a packet and you just throw them into the pan and cook it for about fifteen minutes?
And that was just potatoes and eggs wasn't it?
And some cheese.
And bacon.
Don't remember.
Oh.
What I want to do, I want to cut the shopping down as much as I possibly can.
Well I think eight pounds is a good start.
But when I go to the shops and I spend  seventy pound for a week.
We have to keep making trips back to the shop because we need  bread or milk or something else that we've forgotten.
So so just make little trips.
So we're just making little trips as we run out of stuff.
Mm.
Good idea.
And see how, if that will work out any better.
Yeah.
Well  the good news for the environmentalists is the bike runs on unleaded.
Mhm.
Which is good news.
Cos like that's  not so expensive.
So, I shall have to take it to the petrol station in a minute.
Yeah.
Does, and does it need erm oil or anything like that?
No.
He showed me where the little oil level was.
So you don't have a dipstick, there's a little  little ho glass hole
Mhm.
where you look in.
Oh right.
With a a maximum and a minimum.
Mhm.
Like on your dipstick.
And you just look at it.
Mm.
Mm.
Well, just be careful when you go out.
Yeah.
Cos I mean it's  it's not the bikers  it's the other vehicle that's on the road.
Alright?
Not more than two minutes.
John will verify this.
Do you remember John?
We came out of the shop, turned left  turned left there, and then turned right.
We're going down this road and John was in front of me  and just as John went past this wagon  it pulled out and there was a car coming the other way.
Eeeeh hit my horn.
Ha  I could have shouted louder.
And he stopped and  luckily there was just enough room for me to slow down and just go between them.
I mean that guy just pulled out in front of me.
Mm.
Huge, huge lorry.
Oh he  he didn't see you or just didn't ?
Didn't care.
Oh.
He saw me alright cos  like John said I had the headlights on.
Yeah.
Well that's it.
Don't expect anybody else to obey the highway code.
Yeah.
Right?
Did you see them two dirty great big no right turn signs?
What no right turn signs ?
You what?
I said to the bloke I said how do you get out that junction?
He said you don't, there's no right turn.
I looked up the road and there was two great big signs, no right turn.


I'd already gone that way twice.
Yeah.
And turned right.
Yeah.
Cos it's a very awkward junction.
Mm.
Thank you mum.
Dog's looking at you.
 
What do you want Ricksy?
Come on then.
What is it Ricky?
Come on then..
dog.
I don't see any  I don't I don't see any bacon in there.
You're not having bacon till Monday.
Are you gonna buy it tomorrow?
No.
Oh.
You're working, so you don't need bacon.
I'm not working Monday.
Well you can go and get it.
Saturday Sunday.
Let's have some  wh when?
Monday.
I'll be up then.
I won't need it.
Well I might get it Sunday for you.
Okay.
But  we talk about this and we said  we're cutting the shopping down, I'm not going shopping.
And the first thing you do is demand that we have butter in the house.
So we had to go and do shopping just to get your butter.
No you didn't.
You bought dog food.
You bought milk.
Yeah I didn't  I didn't actually  need to go shopping or I didn't want to go shopping.
You did.
You needed butter.
No.
You needed butter.
There's margarine.
Alright.
Don't you eat it.
Don't you touch that butter.
Right.
I won't.
Nor anybody else.
If you're saying you're buying the butter solely for me, then I just want me solely to eat it.
Cos I'm not carrying the can.
I needed butter as well.
Brian, you're not to eat it.
What!
Not even on my toast at night?
No.
She says  you had to go out and buy butter solely because I wanted it.
And I've 
Oh 
I've had the bollocking cos we've had to buy butter.
Well I wanted it as well so that's two against one.
And if you see her, see her eating our butter  there will be a row.
Cos
you've said that.
I won't have Flora on the toast.
I think that's horrible.
It goes all watery.
Look I'm not amused at all.
Well neither am I.
na na na na na 
He said he wants butter.
Yeah.
Well why couldn't you put up with margarine for one day?
Oh we could have.
But I didn't mind going shopping.
Yeah well sh I wouldn't have minded just for today.
I I didn't mind going  
I didn't s I I didn't say 
Now you say that  


I didn't say I'd got to have it today.
Cos I don't.
Yes you did.
No I did not.
You s your suggestion was send Brian to the shops.
Not mine.
Now that was the 
Well can you empty one of those and put it  and put it in that bucket.
Will you turn that tape recorder off so I can thump him.
Thumping me probably won't come out on the tape.
I came out with the awful truth today to the lads.
So you dropped it.
They loved it.
So you told them you fell off your bike?
You said  you're not gonna believe this.
He goes  why aren't you on your bike Brian?
I goes  I went to the  end I goes look  I'll tell you all together  get it over with  I lost my balance and I dropped it.
Alright?

You know our car's D V P.
Yeah.
Oh and I can't eat that  bread and butter now.
I'm chockered.
Yeah  one of the, one of the lads there Alan, he goes er  I'm surprised you haven't committed suicide yet after dropping your pride and joy.
Well it does hurt your pride.
Oh yeah.
Specially when you do it in front of all the neighbours.
Can't show my face again.
I'm afraid we cannot have any of this.
Too .
Hope it's dry tomorrow.
I won't feel so bad about going to work on it then.
If it's wet just take your time.
Yeah.
Keep it upright.
I can't understand how I did it you know.
Well you didn't realize it was going over did you?
No.
It catches you by surprise.
I think I must have had my weight to the front of the bike, you know, coming up on the braking.
Er this tap's dripping.
When does the insurance run out?
Eh?
When does the insurance run out?
Where does?
The insurance  run out.
It's run out.
Wednesday.
Oh Wednesday.
Quick, ring up.
Shouldn't be dripping.
Pressure's not high.
Pressure was down again this morning.
We must keep an eye on that.
Yeah.
Cos  between one and two bar  on the, on the erm boiler.
What was it on?
Eh?
It means, means the system wasn't pressurized.
Yeah.
But it could be very dangerous.
It's not right.
Will it give a constant read out through the day?
Even when it's switched off?
Yeah.
It shouldn't move.
Oh.
The pressure's okay Mary.
Cos I didn't notice it this morning.
I didn't notice it this morning.
Probably be alright to use the hot water system but not the heating.
Oh right.
Because it's a pressurized system.
So if you have a look and you can't see that needle.
Yeah.
The, the water is  the water pressure's definitely changed.
Well it's changed now cos it's up now.
I in the shower in the shower  for one.
It's up now.
I it's weak in the shower.
Er well it would have been.
There was no pressure on it.
No, it's always weak.
It's always weak in the shower now.
Mm?
It's never as strong as it used to be.
It shouldn't be.
It should be okay.
And it's cold as well.
Have you noticed?
Yeah I was  I had a shower, well, perhaps the water's been turned down a bit.
I I keep turning it up again but it it's cold every time I use it.
You know I pull it out and turn it up hot.
No I mean here.
Oh there.
On the boiler.
That water.
Rick.
It's only one and a half.
It should be higher than that.
I'll put it up to two and a half and it should be warm enough there.
Right.
Lovely.
Is  just?
Well we'll have to watch that boiler.
Yeah.
They're fatal if we, if  it.
You just opened the door on the dog's mouth.
Opened the fridge door and hit him right on the
Yeah.
right in the mouth didn't you Rick?
Poor Rick.
My poor baby.
Aah!
Come, what did she do to you?
What have I got for you?
Hang on, hang on.
How much do you love me?
That much?
Okay.
You're only having little bits.
You're not having any bones or anything like that.
We'll have to keep it out, and use it.
Is there a time limit?
Forty five minutes a side so it's erm 
I mean no.
When he wants it all done by.
Yeah, Saturday.
Saturday?
All those tapes?
Well as many as possible.


That's what I mean.
We'll have to keep it out.
Somebody's put it away you see.
Mother.
Yeah.
Oh I don't doubt it.
There's only one person that commits the mortal sins.
That's it.
Yeah.
And her name is mother.
Well I'm certain it begins with M.
Rick.
You're not having any rice.
No.
Where's all this paperwork?
That's all mine.
What you looking for?
Paperwork belongs to this.
Mary.
Ooh!
That hurt.
Mary.
I didn't want him to have that.
Mary.
Mary  where's the paperwork belonging to that?
I dunno John.
Oh that's some of it.
Have a, get it all out then Brian.
There's a book in there I've gotta fill in.
That's it.
That's it.
There doesn't happen to be a pen in there does there?
Oh I see one.
That my erm cover note?
I've no idea.
Friday the thirteenth.
What a day to buy a motorbike.
See the value of the bike came down, the value of the insurance came down cos I put the value at twelve hundred pounds.
See erm there was a ten percent discount if you had it erm  under twelve hundred and fifty pounds.
Yeah.
So in some ways it's cheaper insurance but in others  it's erm  a bit of a sting.
Have you done?
Come on.
Oy.
See that machine there?
What does it do?
It hides behind mother so that Brian can't get at it.
No.
This plates go in this way.
Well I'm not allowed to use this machine so er 
Knives and forks should go in  that way.
Right?
Why that way?
There are glass plates   somewhere.
Have you made any tea Mary?
No.
No.
Do you want some tea?
I want to get into the habit of finishing  and getting the dishwasher on and ge cleaning the kitchen completely.
I told him to ring  I told him ring Apex up in case they were recruiting.
Because there are jobs up on the notice board.
But he said Apex  didn't know anything about it at the moment.
So I mean, if Apex don't know anything about it I don't know why they don't .
Now you know I don't get on with plastic.
Oh I got it first time.
I got it first time.
Oh god.
Tell her there will be half a pie for her tea otherwise she don't get none.
I mean this is ridiculous.
Yeah.
Turn that on for me will you?
Just  
It's making work for everybody.
And one thing we don't want is extra work.
I mean if we get finished now and clean the ki cooker and and clean everything  and say right, we're out of the kitchen then, nothing more tonight.
That's it.
If they want something they can get it themselves.
Yeah.
Yeah but  tell them to clean up after them.
Mm.
Don't leave it for you all the time.
Yeah.
Lynn doesn't cook any meals for any of them.
No.
Well I mean that's different to the way we live though isn't it?
Mm.?
Mm?
Packet of instant mash.
Tin of peas  and a tin of spam.
Mm, could you imagine me 
Lovely.
And throws it all in  puts it all on the plate cold  and puts it in the microwave.
No wonder he sits in the chair and does nothing.
Because they do it at home.
Eat that food now.
I've had enough of you.
You're being perfectly silly.
Erm, I can't think what you do tomorrow when you go with Steve .
I mean that will be three hours continuous.
Yeah.
I  remind me in the morning.

And she would discuss my diet amongst other things.
Oh dear.

Hey you, I buttered that bread for you and you didn't eat it.
I can't mum, I'm full.

These people that have to listen to these tapes you know, they must get terribly bored mustn't they?
I dunno.
I suppose it can be quite entertaining.
Yeah I should think so, yeah.
Mm?
I suppose it can be quite entertaining sometimes.
Mm.
Wait till Trish gets in.
Then it will liven up.
It's sure to.
Er I I suppose it's to see how people use the English language.
What words we use, what words aren't used.
What slang we use.
We use all the words of the English language don't we?
We use the yellow ones, the blue ones, the black ones.
I wonder how they'd get on with somebody with  foreign?

George.
He's gonna get me glass?
No, lights.
Oh lights.
George ?
Yeah.

He makes them.
Well  Lynwood do them.
Oh?
So the next time he goes he's gonna  get some for me.
Oh does George work for the  Lynwood?
What do you th what do you think  
He does he does ma a lot of manufacture for Lynwoods.
Oh.
What do you think of having in here artexed or airtexed or  whatever it's called, artex.
Yeah, good idea.
But we're not spending any money.
Yeah.
I think  Jean said, well she watched the others do it.
They only did like erm  a square foot every time.
Erm you have to do, put it on  and then design it.
And then move over to the next square.
Put it on, design it  she said because it dries very quickly.
Mm.
It's only like a plaster of paris stuff isn't it?
It does go off quick.
Mm that's right.
Quick.
She said it's er  about ten pound a tub but I don't know how far a tub would go?
Not very far.
Mm.
And then she said there was stuff called textured paint  that has, it's like paint with lumps in it.
I think it's just lumpy paint gone wrong and then  and they sell it.
But then she said you get erm  you put it on and you get a brush and er not a brush, a roller.
And the roller has  a design, a line on it.
Different designs.
That's right yeah.
And then you just roll it on.
Mm.
Yeah.
Mm.
Said Debbie's used that in her house.
It could definitely do with something.
But we'll leave it for now.
Mm.
When, when he was in I saw he I saw Mark  look at that corner.
Mm.
And he copped off.
That one there?
Yeah.
It's skew-wiff.
What does it come out does it?
Goes in.
Ah so I see, yes.
Goes in about an inch.
Mm.
Mm.
He was saying to me it was very difficult to do.
Well I can't understand why.
I mean really what he should have done if it, if it was that difficult he should have gone back another half a brick  and the j bricked it up all the way
Mm.
level, instead of putting bits and pieces in.
Surely 
Yeah.
he could have half bricked it all the way up?
Mm.
Instead of saying how difficult it was putting bits and pieces in.
I would have thought that's what I would have done.
You know, just come straight up with a row of bricks.
Logical thing to do.
Yeah.
That's what I thought.
I mean it didn't have to be spot on.
As long as it came back out to where it is now.
Ah.
Good boy.
The dog was lying there last night and Patricia said something to him, I don't know what she said to him  but the look on his face.
You could tell it really upset him, whatever she said to him.
Yeah.
She she wouldn't tell us what she'd said to him either, so it must have been bad.
But did you fart?
He probably farted.
Oh yeah well.
Rick.
You cheeky.
Good boy boys.
Cos we're talking about you.
Go to sleep now.
Good boy.
Close your eyes.
That's it.
Close your eyes and go to sleep.
Go on go on.
Go on.


You  soft animal.
He won't close his eyes in case you do something to him.
Yeah.
In case he see in case he misses something.
What  are you going out now?
Yeah.
I was gonna wash the car.
I'll do it tomorrow.
I've never 
Hey mum 
seen it so dirty.
just think  this time next week  you'll have me new car for me.
Yeah it's my birthday present.
Eh?
Top of me list.
It's not on it's not on the list.
You're not having it.
.


Number one A 
Forget it.
You're too late now, you've made the list.
Oh!
You are slow.
Mm.
Do do do do  
How many tapes do they expect you to fill up John?
I don't know.
As many as are full up.
Whether it be one, two ten fifteen, it doesn't matter.
And what why do you have to fill in the form?
Erm every time you use a tape  you fill in  this is tape side B  tape one side B  tape two side A  tape two side B.
Oh.
So we're still on side one?
No we're on one side B.
We've done side A.
Is it full?
Yeah.
When, what was the date we started recording on the tape?
Was it  Saturday?
What date was last Saturday?
Dunno John.
Fourteen fifte fourteenth?
That bloke didn't come on Saturday, he come on Friday didn't he?
No, well  
What, why have you put down that you have your regional accent and I have an Irish accent?
I haven't.
Well, you can't tell that I'm Irish but I can tell you're Irish.
Oh.
How can you do that?
I I  .
You're you're a frigging idiot you are.
How do you know that people can't tell you're Irish?
Nobody can.
Nobody can tell  that I'm Irish.
Only when I swear.
And you know I don't swear very often.
No.
Erm
kids  anyway.
But that could change when Patricia comes in.
And what  does erm why does Brian and Patricia not have a regional accent?
Well I don't think they have.
Think a brummie accent.
They haven't got a brummie accent, no.
No.
And th th they haven't got a twang as far as I know anyway so
Mm.
I'm only putting the truth down as I see it.
Yeah.
You know?
I mean I could be wrong.
I can only put down what I know  to be  the truth as far as I can tell.
Mhm.
There doesn't seem to be a regional accent in this area does there?
If you start going further towards Worcester, Worcestershire.
Into Worcester 
The black country.
That area.
that that area.
Well, into  Hailsowen 
Wales.
Mhm.
places like that, then you would get an accent.
I suppose it's too much of a mixture up here isn't it?
Mhm.
But I don't look at Birmingham people 
Who?
The girl next door.
when Brian ?
Thought he'd be  but he wasn't.  kids .
Out.
You'd better eat that food.
I've seen  you know the, the coat she brought home first of all?
I've seen a lot of people up town wearing that coat, but they were all much older.
I would have said they were in their forties.
Yeah.
You know, mutton dressed as lamb.
Yeah.
Wearing that type of coat.
But 
Yeah.
that one that she brought home does look decent.
Right I'll move the car then, out of his way.
Well switch your tape off.
Oh you've been to see him?
Yeah.
Who's that?
And er  he he suddenly looked up and went  it's Brian!

Tell her you've come to take her to the ol the pensioners' club on her, on your bike.
Yeah.
Come on, jump on.
She might get on it as well.
I've been ever so tired.
Yeah.
I tell you what did wake me up though John.
Coming down the er  the old church highway towards the house  from town er the white arrows in the road
You've gotta keep off them.
I found that out.
You what?
You know the white arrows in the road?
The white the white lines 
Mhm.
and manhole covers.
You've gotta find out where they are.
What about them?
Yeah.
I've gotta memorize where they are from now on.
Why?
The white lines  and the arrows in the middle of the lane.
Why?
They make you change your line.
Because I went over it
Mm and skidded?
doing about sixty  and I felt a twitch in the wheel and I thought shit!
I'm not going over one of them again.
Mm.
Well you have to sometimes.
You'll get used to it and it doesn't affect you 
I suppose it  a bit?
after a bit.
But you've got to watch them when they're, when you're in the wet.
I was I was, I was slightly banked at the time.
Mm.
Just very slightly.
You w if your d wheel does move it won't move far.
You get used to that, the wheel  moving over a bit.
I suppose er it's a trick not to over correct?
It will stop itself.
It will, it just might slide a bit but it will stop sliding  when it comes off it.
Yeah.
Cos  by the time you  you've felt it you've passed it maybe?
Well you you've travelled another hundred yards.
Yeah.
I  er I suppose you have to be very careful er and find out what is on the road?
But like tomorrow when I go to work
Keep away from the kerbs.
That's the most important thing.
Yeah.
I ride in the middle of the lane.
Tomorrow when I go to work on it, I'm going through er  I'm not gonna go through  Bowgreen I don't wanna go that way.
go that way .
Well you can go straight up to Longridge Lane.
I'll go straight through Longridge Lane.
That way.
Yeah.
There's a lot, there's 
Up to Gr  Gravelly Corner 
Yeah it's up 
Are you going over to Droitwich on it or will you go in your car?
I'll go to Droitwich on it, yeah.
Mm.
And then coming back here to get changed or what?
I've I've booked the whole morning off.
Well I I p I personally think 
When you gotta go Droitwich?
you would you would need 
Tomorrow morning.
Oh tomorrow.
I personally think you would need 
Well the weather forecast is dry anyway.
more experience dri riding on the bike  as it is, without erm having your rucksack and things on.
Get used to carrying it.
Mm?
Get used to carrying it.
It  it didn't bother me at all.
I'm not kidding you, it did I didn't feel it.
I could feel a slight pressure on me shoulders, but it didn't restrict my movements in any way.
When?
When I was c coming back with the boots in them.
In it.
On Saturday.
Mm.
Well, just be very careful.
And don't get over cocky.
And keep away from big lorries.
Yes mum.
I fully intend to keep away from them anyway.
I mean a bit of fear  is a good thing.
Erm, I'm still scared every time I pull away.
You know,ji little jitterbugs.
Yeah.
And  I went up Iver Road as well.
On a bike?
O o on the way back from Andrew's, yeah.
I always found that awkward at the top.
Yeah.
Specially if there was cars on the hill and I had to pull up behind them.
Cos you you run out of you know, what things to do.
Cos you've gotta have one foot on the ground  and you've gotta have one o ha foot, one on the brake
Yeah.
one on the clutch, one on the throttle
Yeah.
and the other one on, and your gear change.


You're one missing.
Yeah .
Yeah you 
I'd just get off and push it .
On Iver Road?


Whoa!
Down he goes.
But luckily there was only a c only one car stopped at the top.
So I just stopped dead and did a hill start.
Stopped at the top and did another hill start.
Plymouth Road's another awkward one.
The first, the first down bit when you're going down Plymouth Road.
Oh yeah, I bet.
When you come to the right, the bend.
Cos it's actually quite s , quite sharp bend.
And it gets wet down there as well.
It gets a bit slippy on there.
And there's manhole covers as you come out the bend.
And don't go  don't go speeding Brian.
You don't have the same control over a bike when you're speeding.
You don't have the same control over a car 
It 
or a bike when you're speeding.
It feels better, going slow.
Cos it's more comfortable.
Yeah.
Your  's 
Yeah.
better.
When I say un slow, under fifty.
You know when you, when you think that police rider 
Go at a speed you can enjoy it.
Mm?
Go at a speed that you can enjoy riding it at.
Yeah.
That's it.
I mean the police riders look as if they're enjoying it.
And and where people can recognize me.
Mm?
Where people can recognize me.
That's it.
Hey look there's Bri.
Look at him go.
Brrr  
And it will last you longer, you know?
Yeah.
Your bike, the engine, the oil.
You reduce it's life.
It's ever so good at the er cruising though.
It's really nice.
It should cruise along at about fifty at, you know, quarter throttle.
Fifty it does about er  three and a half, four thousand R P M.
Yeah.
It's about right for a four hundred.
Mine would be doing about five grand at that.
Four and a half, five.
Mm.
Mine went up with, you know let's face it if I was doing sixty mile an hour it would be doing just over six grand.
Yeah.
Anything over that, you know mine is going up towards the seven into the red.
The red on that's about ten.
Yeah.
And mine did and mine's only a, mine was only a sm you know one eight five .
Yeah.
I haven't had it above er above about eight grand I think.
That was when I wound it up on a carriageway.
Don't, just keep your revs down.

You get redundant  there and then, no warning, nothing!
So  she couldn't go out to work cos she'd got young girls to bring up  so they went to the social  and the social turned round and said to them  before we give you any money  you've gotta spend all this bloody redundancy  you've gotta have used all your savings, including the kids savings, and you've gotta have nothing!
And tha , that's terrible!
Why should the girls have to  you know, lose  their savings  and money that money that people have given them as gifts  just because, you know  they don't want to give out any money!

I'd only just bought the Granada.
It was the weekend I bought the Granada, I'm sure it was when we went away    first time I ever took it out for a run.
I didn't go Rick!
Good old car that was  I made a profit on that.
Yeah.
I used to love driving that around, it was that long, me sat behind the wheel I looked like a dot in that!
Made me look little!
The bloke  the bloke that wanted it couldn't wait to get his hands on it.
Still got it ain't he?
No, he knackered that!
No  did he?
He didn't have it long  he wrecked it!
They started playing about with it  you know?
Playing about with the engine and  playing about with the body work, trying to do it up and all this and they just  they just 
 
wrecked it.
cos people don't appreciate things do they?
Well this is it you see , his son was supposed to be a mechanic, well he wasn't!
He was a employed by  Dorrisons I think as a recovery bloke, you know  
Oh!
cos he  he thought he was a mechanic because he was doing that sort of work.
Course he started messing with the er  bodywork and the engine and  they just wrecked it , but then he sold it to another driver  and this other bloke Bob erm  oh
I remember seeing it round  a bit 
Bob , Bob , for a bit and  he done a few miles on it  and then he sold it  to somebody else in the garage.
Ooh  it's done the rounds then?
Yeah  and then  it disappeared then, I think, you know, I could see it deteriorating every day  it was about, it was about three of my cars  parking here.
And I remember the old erm  what was it, Cavalier?
Cavalier yeah.
The old Cavalier.
Good car that.
And the, the Granada, what else was there?
Oh he had that Cavalier for a few years after I sold it.
Yeah.
Actually that wasn't a bad car either, to drive.
Which one?
The Cavalier.
The Cavalier, yeah, it was, I liked that one.
Nice car.
I just hope the steering's lighter on this one  
It's lighter on that Metro you know  it's ever 
Yeah.
so easy.
Yeah, I hope it's lighter on this one.
Wish I could afford a new car, I'd love a nice new car!
We won't be able to afford one for a couple of years yet.
You could afford a Mini though.
I don't want a Mini dad, don't like them.
But you could afford to cho I mean, the cheapest Metro is only about er, six grand you know?
Not a lot 
Mm.
to me.
Well with i , with his overtime cut we can't 
You ne 
afford nothing at the moment.
Yeah.
You see yo really you'd need to be  you'd need to be only need to be paying back about four grand you see, though?
Yeah.
You'd be paying something like what I pay, which is a hundred and
Well I mean 
Forty five a month.

Ooh bless you!
Oh sorry!
You'll have to keep an eye on his mouth.
 Ay 
You'll have to keep an eye on his mouth today.
I know.
Just in case it doesn't stop.
 Eargh Rick, it's muddy!
The  contract is back again, I done all this erm  water pipe  it were all gravel in there  sunk into the ground you know  big hole in the ground!
We went back there yesterday .
Get all the mud off my trainers.
We erm  had a load of kids visit the store yesterday
Ah yeah.
and  Andrea phones me up, she says  do you wanna do one of the tours for me, take the kids round?
Yeah I don't mind  I only get the cla , the the lad, the group with the two naughty boys in don't I?
Ah!
They were .
Yeah.
 Cor blimey!
Was there a teacher with them?
There wa , there was parents with them,
Oh yeah.
cos the school couldn't afford to put a minibus on!
So the parents bought them in their cars and they come round with them.
They were more interested than the kids!
There was one little boy  the one had to touch everything  now don't touch that pot!
Now don't touch tha tha , you can't touch that!
No, don't!
You know, it was all that all morning, and the one kept saying  I'm tired!
I'm hungry!
I've, I want to finish now!
Go to your mum !
Can I have a drink !
That's all I got out of this one boy!
They were alright  the rest of them weren't too bad.
We took them to the fish, well I took them to the fish and no , many o , any of the oth other groups went  and some of them , they're very good!
The lad in the butchery, he was 
Yeah.
brilliant with them, he was!
Yeah.
He really was very good!
And he give them all a ticket out the machine and
Yeah.
cut the meat up while they were there and put it in the machine, and that happened and  all this that and the other.
Yeah.
And er  they loved that!
And they all had a hat with a sticky label on and
Oh!
everything else.
And then we went to the fish  and the one, oh I'm tired!
And he was going  it smells,it smell !
Ah shut up!
But the lady in the fish was brilliant!
Was she?
She got them out  one of everything  and showed them all the different fish.
Yeah.
But, we couldn't actually go into the department, cos you have to wear your wellies and all that.
Oh yeah.
So we were stood in the doorway.
Yeah.
Ooh and they loved every minute of it!
They really did!
I can comb my hair now  and then we go  straight up town.
And it looks like nobody'll be able to drive in their car, except for Aunt Mary.
Oh!
She said the only way you could  another way you can cut your costs, he said, is, is that due to all these drivers he said, you've got it  you've virtually got any driver on this car  said just  just have it you and yo , and your wife  he said, and that'll cut your costs down enormously.
Sounds a bit rough dad!
Which?
This.
Mm  it's alright.
It's growling!
I've never noticed it before.
Yeah, it does  it's alright.
It's funny you know, since I've been having  these new cars  I see these old cars, what a lot of bloody rubbish on the road, you know!
I know , we used to drive round in them half the time!
Yeah, bloody right!
I still do.
It'd do me and all if I had to.
Ha?
It'd do me and all if I had to.
Don't bother me!
Oh no, it is nice to have a nice car but  you have to make do don't you?
That's right, yeah.
Make do with what you ca , what you can afford at the time.
Another twenty years and my mortgage will be paid off so I can have a new car then!
Oh, don't say that!
Dad, if that's what you wanna do, nobody's .
No.
But  as long as you earn your living that's  nice and quiet,and you won't have no problems in that area .
We're not too bad because I mean 
No unless you wanna move for a specific reason, there's just 
Yeah.
no point in moving.
No.
I mean don't have any problem with the neighbours or nothing 
No that's 
like that.
that's what you've gotta look for you see.
The one side is never there.
Now, you see you're lucky that  that  he's, he's sort of over there 
And the other side's detached so
and the other side detached, and how many kids have they got?
Three  three 
 
girls.
Three girls, see you're lucky really cos  if they'd had three boys  an i , in a few times, you know, ten years time like, they'd have all, the boys would of been growing up  and they'd have had cars stuck everywhere, you know what I mean?
Yeah.
Though with the girls, that's a bit more unlikely.
Mm.
I mean, I know it s sounds stupid but that's what you've gotta look for today.
You look at your neighbours, see how many kids they got, see what age they are  and work out what's it gonna be like in ten years time.
Yeah.
Like Billy  were he lives, he lives on   by the courts, you know by the  Law Centre?
Is that the one who  you went to, his house?
He gives me a lift to work.
Yeah  Yeah.
Yeah.
And er  these people, you know, next door like have got er  they've got six or seven boys I think!gang of kids!


They're  boys.
They said all of a sudden they've all grown up!
That's how we got terrible problems cos they've all got erm  cars.
Yeah.
And his father's one of these obnoxious types you know?
All   anybody you know?
Yo , I don't care what you do!
You do what you like, I do what I do, you can  you know?
Yeah.
Please yourself!
And they've got this  doberman or something that barks all the time like, and it's allowed i in the garden and it sits in the garden all the time and all the rest of it!
They just don't care!
There's a lot of about tha , like that though isn't there?
Yeah, they're probably  
 
lived next to me, I'd have poisoned it?
One of the woman at work
the other day.
yeah, one of the woman at work  she's a right stuck up old  silly old bugger she is!
She don't speak to nobody, she really does think she's above everybody  ever such a funny woman!
And where Carole lives out in  Earlswood , down the lanes  she lives round there as well.
Well Carole's next door neighbour  he owns a bit of land and he's got some sheep in his fields, and he's got some pigs and you know?
Well, this woman her dog was scaring the sheep, so he shot it!
Killed it!
Which he's quite  within his right to do, if it's scaring the sheep 
yeah.
so, ooh there's been uproar  about this bloody dog!
And, I mean, we, we was on about it one day, and she was only sat on the table next to us, ooh she was giving us daggers!
But I mean the chap was quite within his rights to shoot it cos it's been scaring his sheep.
Well apparently her husband, he's been round smashing his windows and  putting 
Oh!
shit through the door and all sorts!
There's really been a lot of trouble over it!
I'd have shot him and all!
Well, the police have been involved, and I suppose he's been cautioned now because  they've investigated and found  that thi that it was scaring the sheep and that, yes i , he was right to do what he did he  quite within his rights and whatever.
So they're not taking any action against the chap for shooting the dog  but now they're, they're watching the other chap for causing disturbances!
Just think, we nearly bought one of those you know, in there!
Two bedroomed house  They were fifty thousand.
Yeah, they are rubbish them there though!
Mm, as it was we  we hung on and
Yeah, you bought the right one.
Wa I wouldn't mind buying one of them myself  you know wi I mean if we could sell ours
Mm.
you know, we could buy one of them and have no mortgage.
Yeah.
I should think 
Yeah.
the cars .
Oh shut up you!
You've got your own frigging mortgage!
I know.
Well  if one of us pops it, one of, the other one's gonna be very well off!
I know if I popped it right now, I mean yo you'd a and Trish and Teresa, you, Debbie, Teresa and Mark.


You'd have about, I think it's about fifty five thousand.
Bloody hell!
That'd buy you a new car wouldn't it?
That's if I die when I'm fifty five or over.
Bloody hell!
The  is about fifty five or over.
Yeah but don't forget 
Shall I wait here?
Yeah, I'm going to get my glasses dad.
Yeah, I've left it here for you right.
What about Mary and them?
They're in the house.
Oh course yeah.
Well just make sure you stay with the Rover then!
Ooh where have I put them now?
I can see now, that's better!
I'll go and try the Fiesta while we're here.

Do you know how the start it?
Is it  
Yeah.

No, it does it to me dad  every now and again it just won't budge!
No  every now and again it just lets you down.
Cos, Mark used to say to me, it's you!
It's you!
I said it is not me!
You open it to the  now.
That's alright.
It's not just  is it?
Yeah.
Is the choke on?
That's automatic, yeah.
Yeah, that's alright I think  sounds alright.
Yeah, I can smell it!
It's   Yeah 
What's wrong with it?
sounds alright.
That's alright then, as long as it starts.
Need a  the , these Fiestas , but they never get them right at the, the bloke I works with got one exactly the same as this  does exactly ten miles and it cuts out on him.


It's been going for about two now 
Oh!
leave it for a few minutes, then start it up again.
Well  I mean that one  once you've got it going, if you can keep it going, it'll go for miles!
Yeah 
I'd go  that'd go round the world that would!
Yeah.
Once you've got it going.
It's the  it's got a  and never sorted them out.
But if you let it stall on you
Mm.

It was a shame actually because  the woman was Linda's husband sister!
Oh!
And she did  narf she did  narf shit on Linda!
She when 
Did she?
when the receiver's come in  and all that, she'd never put Linda down as working for her, so she got no redundancy pay!

Oh.
I'll leave it up to Mark.
I want him to buy a car but
Well if you do decide  to buy a car, if you wanna get a new one, I'll  over.

That's right.
For a Metro.

but 
you can lose money.
I've, I've said to Mark  it's your money
That's right, let him do it .
and  do with it as you will  because at the end of the day then he can't turn round and sa , to me and say  well you wanted to do this with it  i , if it goes wrong!
