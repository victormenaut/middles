Classification of aquarium plants according to growth pattern
A. Floating Plants
Plants which float on the surface with or without rooting at the bottom
These plants float on the surface with their roots hanging below the water.
In certain species, the long, fine roots trail below as far as the muddy or sandy bottom and anchor the plant, still giving it ample freedom for floating.
The Water Hyacinth belongs to this category.
Floating plants require a high concentration of light, and given satisfactory conditions will grow and multiply quickly, covering large areas of the water surface.
This tends to rob submerged aquatic plants of light and hinder their growth.
Therefore, when such plants are grown, care should be taken not to allow them to shade the entire water surface of the tank.
A certain area of the water surface can be allowed to be covered over by floating plants, especially if certain plants preferring shade or poor light conditions are grown.
Further, young fish will prefer such a shady area.
The loose, fine tufts of roots of these plants will provide an ideal haven for the fish, and also spawning areas in which they can lay their eggs.
There are only a few species of plants which grow floating on the water surface and are considered as useful for the heated aquarium.
The following species can be considered as those popular among aquarists.
Among the other species which can be considered as useful for the heated aquarium, but are less popular due to one reason or another, the following are worthy of being listed.
These species, however, are not described in the text.
B. Submerged plants
1.
Plants which root at the bottom and have leaves at the base in the form of a rosette.
To this category belong more than half the plants universally popular among aquarists.
The sizes, shapes and forms of the species in this group are numerous, and their requirements and habits are as varied as their natural habitats.
These plants consist of roots or rootstock, stems, and leaves usually borne on leaf-stalks.
The formation of the leaves on the uppermost part of the plant is known as the crown.
It is from this crown that the flower spikes and the long, wiry runners, both of which are instrumental in producing new plants, grow.
Some plants grow from a spongy rootstock, as in the case of Vallisneria, Sagittaria or Ottelia species.
Others are produced from thick rootstock called rhizomes.
Acorus and Anubias species have such rhizomes.
There are still others which grow from rootstock called bulbs or corms, which are either round, oval or cylindrical.
These bulbs, corms or tubers are also found in land plants, such as the daffodil, dahlia or potato.
The tubers, bulbs or corms are the food organs from which the plants obtain their nourishment.
Therefore, it is important that plants which have such rootstock should always he planted with them intact.
If these are removed before planting, then the plants will suffer and often fail to establish themselves.
2.
Plants which root at the bottom with leaves borne on vertical stems.
All plants in this category consist of long, cylindrical or roundish stems which bear leaves.
Many branches are produced on the main stems.
The points where the leaves grow on the stems are known as nodes.
In many species, fine white or pinkish roots develop from these nodes.
Therefore propagation can be easily done by taking stem-cuttings which will be planted.
Some plants, however, produce runners or stolons along the tank bottom which Produce new shoots.
If given good conditions, most plants will grow erect and above the water surface and even flower.
When this happens, the plant is known to be in an ‘emerse’ condition.
If the plant does not grow above the water surface, then it is known to be in the ‘submerse’ condition.
When planting species of this group, it is better to plant them in a cluster or bunch.
This gives an appearance of a good bush.
A single stem planted on its own does not create a good effect.
Once the plants branch out and grow thick, they can be pruned to keep them under control and stimulate new growth.
3.
Plants which root at the bottom but float their leaves on the surface.
To this group belong all the water-lilies, which, without exception, produce the most attractive flowers seen on the water surface.
Usually the plant has its rootstock deeply buried in the mud or tank medium.
It sends forth long, trailing stems with leaves up to the water surface, where they float.
At the bottom of the plant a few small leaves develop, often forming a small bush.
From the centre of the plant flower buds develop, and these grow to the water surface and blossom.
Apart from the attractiveness of the flowers, the fleshy, leathery, circular or oval leaves of diverse coloration make the water-lily a favourite plant to be kept in the heated and unheated aquarium.
Nuphar, Nymphaea and Nymphoides species provide good specimens for the aquarist.
Besides these, there are several other non-lily species which belong to this category.
The popular Water-clovers (Marsilea) produce long runners which in turn grow tall, slender stems which float leaves on the water surface.
Echinodorus nymphaefolius is another one.
SECTION THREE Aquarium Plants
Genus: ACORUS
Species:
Acorus calamus var. angustifolius
Family:
Araceae
Common name:
Sweet Flag
Easy pronunciation:
A-korus kal-am-oos
Habitat:
India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Indonesia.
Description:
The leaves are deep green, smooth, narrow, up to 24ins (60cms) long and pointed at the end.
These grow in a rosette borne on a thick, cylindrical, horizontal rootstock.
These leaves are very aromatic.
Numerous shoots grow from the nodes of the rootstock.
This is essentially a marsh plant.
Cultivation:
The planting medium should contain a good amount of humus.
A mixture of peat and clay or unwashed sand with clay is suitable.
In the aquarium it will thrive on a gravel or sand medium alone containing plenty of plant detritus.
As it does better emersed than submerged, it is easily propagated in a container such as a flower-pot, provided the soil is kept very muddy.
The propagation is done by cutting pieces of the rootstock (rhizome) and planting it in any muddy soil.
The rhizome cutting will produce shoots very quickly, and strong, fine roots will develop.
Other requirements:
Light: Appreciates good light from above and all round, though light from above is perfectly adequate.
Water temperature: A range of 65°–74°F.
It does well at the lower temperature, and will take some time to adapt to the temperatures above 70°F.
Water condition: Slightly acid conditions, with a pH of 6.5–6.8, and soft to medium hard water suitable.
Comments:
Acorus is a marsh plant, and therefore does well in emerse rather than submerged conditions.
It does not last very long in the aquarium, but while it lasts it produces a very attractive erect rosette.
Because of its preference for lower temperatures, this is an ideal plant for the garden pool.
This species is used as a medicinal herb in the East.
Species:
Acorus calamus var. pusillus
Common name:
Dwarf Sweet Flag
Easy pronunciation:
A-ko-rus kal-am-oos
Habitat:
Malaysia, Indonesia, India.
Description:
The leaves are dark green, stiff, narrow and up to 5in (just over 12cms) long.
The plant is altogether much smaller than A. calamus var. angustifolius, producing a small, compact rosette.
Cultivation:
The planting medium should be the same as for the preceding species.
Other requirements:
Light: Requires good light, especially from above.
Water temperature: 60°–70°F.
Water condition: Slightly acid to neutral, with a pH of 6.5–7.0.
Comments:
This species is not well suited to the heated aquarium.
It progresses very little in the submerged condition, and dies off after 2 or 3 months.
Therefore, unless for interest, it is not recommended.
Species:
Acorus gramineus var. foliis variegatis
Common name:
Variegated Sweet Flag or Rush
Easy pronunciation:
A-ko-rus grar-min-ay-oos.
Habitat:
Malaysia especially Sabah.
Description:
The leaves are green, with yellowish-white edging, narrow and long, stiff and flat, up to 20ins (50cms) in length.
These form a fan-shaped rosette.
The rhizome or rootstock is fairly slender.
Cultivation:
Requires a similar planting medium to that for the preceding Acorus species.
Other requirements:
Light: Very good light required from the top.
Water temperature: 70°–76°F.
Water condition: Soft to medium hard water, with a pH of 6.5–7.0.
Comments:
This sub-species is fairly slow-growing, but has attractive foliage.
Like the other Acorus species described so far, it grows only for a few months in the aquarium.
Though it is popular among aquarists, it is recommended only as a curiosity.
Genus: ALTERNANTHERA
Species:
Alternanthera philoxeroides
Family:
Amaranthaceae
Common name:
Alligator weed
Easy pronunciation:
Al-ter-nan-the-ra fil-ox-er-oi-days
Habitat:
U.S.A.
Description:
The leaves are yellowish-green or bright green, oblong with pointed ends, up to 6ins (15cms) and an inch (21½cms) long.
These are borne on long, wiry, numerously branched stems with nodes.
Fine pinkish-white roots appear at the nodes.
A tall, erect plant.
Cultivation:
Completely undemanding as to its growing medium.
However, a mixture of clay and peat or sand will produce strong and healthy plants.
Propagation is done by cuttings.
The fine roots develop and establish rapidly.
Other requirements;
Light: Good, strong, even light is essential for bright foliage.
Water temperature: 74°–78°F is the ideal range.
Water condition: Soft, slightly acid to neutral water, with a pH of 6.8–7.0.
However, it will grow moderately well in a slightly alkaline condition with a pH of up to 7.2.
Comments:
A tall, sturdy plant, producing thick tufts, with attractive yellowish-to pinkish-green stems, reasonably easy to grow.
Species:
Alternanthera rubra
Easy pronunciation:
Al-ter-nan-thera roo-bra.
Habitat:
India, Sri Lanka, Malaysia.
Description:
The bronze-red to greenish-red leaves are oblong or somewhat oval-shaped, borne on a very short stalk on brownish-green, slender stems.
The undersides of the leaves are greyish-green and silky smooth.
The many-branched plant is thickly tufted, growing to a height of up to 12ins (30cms).
This is essentially a marsh plant.
Cultivation:
This plant requires a muddy bottom, therefore a mixture of clay and sand is ideal.
Otherwise it is undemanding.
Propagation is by cuttings, planted in the same way as A. sessilis.
Other requirements:
Light: Bright light from above to bring about the deep mauve or reddish colour.
When grown in subdued light, the leaves become greenish-brown or bronze colour with greenish blotches.
Water temperature: Grows within a range of 68°–78°F, the optimum being 74°F.
Water condition: Fairly soft water, with a slightly acid to neutral pH of 6.6–7.0.
Comments:
In the tropics this species and A. sessilis are grown as marsh or terrestrial plants as a vegetable.
Those grown in marshy conditions produce tall, profusely branching luscious leaves on fleshy stems, while those grown on drier land produce compact, low-spreading, smaller-leaved plants with wiry, slender stems.
Like the other Alternanthera species, this only survives for a short period under water.
Useful as a specimen accent plant.
Species:
Alternanthera sessilis
Easy pronunciation:
Al-ter-nan-the-ra se-si-lis
Habitat:
Malaya, India, Sri Lanka.
Description:
The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped and up to 2ins (5cms) long.
The wine-red to brownish-pink leaves with a prominent midrib grow oppositely in pairs on a rigid, yellowish-brown stem covered with fine hairs, and full of axial buds.
The plant, branching freely, grows to a height of up to 20ins (50cms).
Cultivation:
Very undemanding as to growing medium, this plant will even grow in plain aquarium gravel or sand.
Naturally enough, any nutritious medium is more than welcome for best growth.
Many shoots develop from its stem, which sometimes grows horizontally.
Propagation is achieved by taking stem cuttings, which should be planted in a mixture of sand and peat or sand and clay.
They root very quickly, and the growth is rapid.
Other conditions:
Light: Requires a fairly strong light from the top.
However, older plants once established will flourish under moderate light.
Water temperature:74°–78°F.
Water condition: Soft water with slight acidity.
pH 6.6–6.8.
Comments:
This plant is used as a vegetable in the East.
The species has a short life under water, and lives up to 6 months in the aquarium.
All species of Alternanthera are marsh-lovers, and therefore do better in an emersed condition, but as their foliage is very attractive, growing them in the aquarium is justified.
Genus: APONOGETON
Species:
Aponogeton bernieranus
Family:
Aponogetonaceae
Easy pronunciation:
Ap-ono-get-on burn-ear-rar-noos
Habitat:
Malagasy.
Description:
The rootstock is tuberous and cylindrical.
Leaves are bright green, long, tapering to a point at both ends, with the exception of the older leaves, which are rounded at the base.
The entire leaf is about 14ins (36cms) long and up to; 2ins (6cms) wide.
On either side of the bold.
midrib are five or six lateral veins connected by a mass of cross-veins.
The leaf tissue (mesophyll) is missing in certain places, thus creating small ‘windows’ on the leaf.
Cultivation:
A planting medium consisting of sand, clay and loam or peat and clay with a small amount of charcoal is suitable.
If available, tropical bulb-fibre can be incorporated into the medium.
The rhizome should be planted at a depth of about an inch with loose, unpacked sand or planting medium over the growing point.
The water should be very clear and with steady turbulence.
It would be easier to plant the tuber first, in a pot consisting of the above mentioned medium and then to place the pot in a shallow tank.
Once it has sprouted and the first few leaves have developed to about an inch, it should be removed and transplanted in the aquarium.
Propagation is by seed.
When the seeds drop off from the flowering spike, they should be left in the tank to float for a few days.
Then collect them and sow in a very shallow container like a dish or bowl containing a mixture of coarse sand and loam or fine peat or potting compost.
The container should have a water depth of about half to three quarters of an inch.
If a temperature of around 74°F is maintained, germination takes place very quickly.
Once the plantlets have grown bigger they are ready for transplanting.
Other requirements:
Light: Bright but not too strong light is essential.
Growth of algae should be checked.
Water temperature: A range of 68°–76°F.
During winter the temperature should be lowered to about 66°F.
Water condition: Soft water with slightly acid to neutral condition.
It will also grow in slightly alkaline water provided the water in changed very regularly.
Comments:
A specialist plant which requires plenty of attention.
It is very delicate and slow-growing, and does not last long in the aquarium.
Species:
Aponogeton crispus
Easy pronunciation:
Ap-ono-get-on kris-poos
Habitat:
Sri Lanka.
Description:
A fibrous cylindrical rhizome produces a rosette of leaves which are dull green to brown, with a stout leaf-stalk.
They are narrow, lance-shaped, up to 20ins (60cms) long and 2ins (6cms) wide rounded at the base and tapering to a point at the tip.
The leaf margins are wavy and finely crispy.
Cultivation:
Very undemanding as to its growing medium.
It will even grow in plain gravel or sand.
Given some clay or loam it will thrive, producing beautiful, luscious leaves.
It readily adapts itself to aquarium conditions.
Propagation is normally done by seed, which should be sown in a container consisting of mud or loam with about an inch of water covering the surface.
Once the seedlings have developed to a reasonable size, they should be transplanted in the aquarium.
Other requirements:
Light: Preference is for bright light, though it will grow quite satisfactorily in moderate conditions.
Water temperature: A wide temperature range of 64°–77°F.
Water condition: Soft water with slightly acid to neutral condition with a pH of 6.6–7.0, the optimum condition being 6.8.
Comments:
A. crispus is capable of adapting to many aquarium conditions.
In Sri Lanka it grows in many regions of differing climatic conditions.
In the hill country it is seen growing in cool waters where the midday water temperature does not exceed 72°F, and drops down to 60°F in the evening.
In the southern areas of the lowlands it grows in ditches, irrigation channels and ponds in water temperatures of 74°–78°F.
The leaf form varies according to the area where it grows.
The leaf colour ranges from dark green to almost brown, and the length of leaf from 4ins (10cms) to 20ins (50cms).
A very hardy Aponogeton, and one of the best to grow in the aquarium.
It produces a dense, tall plant.
A. crispus is used as a vegetable in the East.
Requires a resting period in Winter.
Species:
Aponogeton fenestralis Synonym: Aponogeton madagascariensis
Common name:
Madagascar Lace-leaf plant
Easy pronunciation:
Ap-ono-get-on fen-es-trar-lis
Habitat:
Malagasy.
Description:
The tuberous rootstock, up to 4ins (10cms) long, is cylindrical and bears a rosette of leaves which are up to 12ins (30cms) long and 3ins (71½–8cms) wide.
The leaves are dark green to brownish-green, egg-shaped or elliptical, rounded at the tip and tapering at the base to the stalk.
There are up to eight parallel veins on either side of the midrib and a mass of cross veins connecting them.
The leaf-tissue is absent and the entire leaf is formed to a pattern of minute windows, giving the appearance of lace.
Hence the term ‘fenestralis’ derived from the Latin ‘fenestra’meaning ‘window’.
Cultivation:
The planting medium recommended for A. bernieranus should be provided.
Ideally the tuber should be sprouted separately in another container such as a flower-pot in the manner described for A. bernieranus.
Later it can be planted in the aquarium.
This is a very delicate plant needing special attention.
It must have very clear, fresh water and therefore the water should be changed very frequently, and great care should be taken not to allow algae growth.
Propagation is by seed, in the same way as described for A. bernieranus.
Sometimes side-shoots grow from the rhizome.
These can be severed and planted as new plants.
Other requirements:
Light: Requires subdued light from above.
Too bright light will harm the plant.
A few floating plants can be grown with this to provide natural shade.
Water temperature: A range of 66°–72°F.
In Winter the temperature should be lowered to 60°–65°F for its hibernation.
Water condition: This grows well both in slightly acid and slightly alkaline water.
The pH range of 6.8–7.2.
Very soft water produces excellent specimens.
Whenever possible well-filtered rain water should be used.
Comments:
Another specialist plant requiring great care and attention.
It would be best grown on its own as a specimen plant.
A very slow grower.
A resting period is necessary.
Species:
Aponogeton henckelianus
Common name:
Henckel's Lace Plant
Easy pronunciation:
Ap-ono-get-on hen-kely-arn-oos
Habitat:
Malagasy.
Description:
A very similar species to A. fenestralis, but with slightly smaller leaves.
These are oval or egg-shaped, brownish green, with stout stalks.
Like that of A. fenestralis, the mesophyll between the cross-veins is missing and therefore appears lace-like.
The leaf is much more delicate than that of the Madagascar Lace-leaf plant.
The rosette-like plant grows from an elongated, oval-shaped rhizome.
Cultivation:
As required for A. fenestralis.
The water should always be clear, clean and fresh.
Therefore regular, partial water-change is to be recommended.
All the other aspects of cultivation are the same as for the delicate Aponogeton species coming from Malagasy.
Propagation is usually done from seed, though occasionally root-division can be carried out.
Other requirements:
Requires subdued, diffused light.
Water temperature: A range of 64°–72°F.
In Winter it should be kept at a temperature around 58°–60°F.
Water condition: Very soft, clear water with slight acidity of a pH of 6.56.8 essential.
Comment:
This plant needs very special attention and therefore is only recommended for the more experienced aquarist.
It would be best grown on its own as a specimen plant.
It requires a resting period during Winter.
Species:
Aponogeton natans Synonym: A. monostachyus
Easy pronunciation:
Ap-ono-get-on nar-tarns
Habitat:
India, Sri Lanka, E. Australia.
Description:
The tuberous rootstock is rounded or oblong, fibrous, up to 1 inch (21½cms) in diameter.
The bright green leaves come in two forms.
The very young leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, slightly crinkled and very delicate looking.
These are followed by floating leaves borne on long stalks; these leaves being slightly darker than the juvenile ones, sometimes undulated and with a prominent midrib bearing four to five parallel veins.
Cultivation:
The planting medium should be fairly rich in organic matter.
A muddy substratum is recommended and therefore a mixture of clay and peat is satisfactory.
Grown in impoverished conditions, the plant becomes stunted but remains alive for a long time while many small shoots develop to give the appearance of an irregularly worn shaving-brush.
Other requirements:
Light: Good to strong light.
Under strong light it will produce many floating leaves, while under good moderate light most of the leaves will remain submerged.
Water temperature:
A range of 70°–78°F.
Water condition:
Soft slightly acid water of a pH of 6.5–6.8.
Comments:
This species is found growing in shallow-water ditches and slow-flowing rivers of the northern provinces of India and Sri Lanka and the southern provinces of E. Australia.
It is also occasionally found growing in small colonies in shallower parts of lakes with gentle water turbulence.
A hardy and easy plant to grow in the aquarium.
It requires a rest period during Winter.
Species:
Aponogeton rigidifolius
Easy pronunciation:
Ap-ono-get-on rig-idy-foe-li-oos
Habitat:
Sri Lanka
Description:
A narrow, cylindrical, horizontally-growing rhizome, produces very long, brownish-green to brownish-purple, leathery, smooth leaves which are slightly wavy at the edges.
They are also translucent with a prominent midrib and many fine lateral veins.
The first few leaves are short and rigid.
The plant grows to a height of up to 24ins (60cms)
Cultivation:
The growing medium should contain some organic humus.
The usual mixture suitable for most aquatic plants, i.e. clay or sand and peat will be most suitable.
As it develops a dense mat of roots, the depth of the mixture should be at least four inches.
The creeping rhizome produces young plants which can be divided and transplanted.
This species can also be grown in a peat or clay base alone.
If peat is used, it will grow quite tall while clay will induce it to grow compact with tougher stalks and fairly brittle leaves.
Other requirements:
Light:
Good light from above and whenever possible sunlight from the front.
Water temperature:
A range of 72°–78°F.
Water condition:
Soft water with slight acidity.
pH 6.5–6.8.
It also requires small amounts of boron and iron for prolific growth.
Comments:
A very slow-growing plant which is sensitive to light conditions.
If sufficient attention is given, excellent accent plants can be grown.
The beautiful foliage with leathery texture, adds a pleasant contrast to the tank flora.
Plenty of space should be given to this plant so that it may bush out.
Therefore other plants should not be planted too near it.
Rhizomes of A. rigidifolius are used as a medicinal herb in the East.
No resting period necessary.
Species:
Aponogeton ulvaceus
Easy pronunciation:
Ap-ono-get-on ul-var-ke-oos
Habitat:
Malagasy.
Description:
A horizontally-growing, cylindrical rhizome of about 1 inch (2½cms) in diameter, produces a plant with translucent, bright green, very wavy, long, ribbon-like leaves, growing up to 24ins (60cms) in length.
They bear several veins running parallel to the central vein.
Leaves grown under strong light have a slight brownish or pinkish tinge.
This is a tall-growing plant with all the leaves remaining submerged.
Cultivation:
The usual planting medium prescribed for the other Aponogeton species is recommended.
During the Winter period, remove the rhizome, cut the leaves right at the base, trim the fibrous roots very close and place it in a container with clay and sand or clay and sand covered with water.
Keep it in a cool, dark place until early Spring, when it should be replanted in the tank.
Allow plenty of room for the plant to develop its long, wavy leaves.
Other requirements:
Light: Good but not very strong light from above.
Even slight shade is tolerated.
Water temperature:
A range of 70°–76°F, optimum being 74°F.
Water condition:
Soft to slightly hard water with slight acidity or slight alkalinity. pH 6.6–7.2.
Some calcium content preferred.
Comments:
In its natural habitat it grows in clear, still waters, sometimes in depths where there is strong sunlight penetration and sometimes in dappled shade.
The leaves change their colour according to the hardness of the water and the type of light available.
This is a very attractive, delicate-looking plant, but fairly easy to grow in the aquarium.
It requires a lot of room for its wavy leaves to spread out, and therefore other plants should not be grown very near it.
A resting period is necessary during Winter..
Species:
Aponogeton undulatus
Easy pronunciation:
Ap-ono-get-on un-du-lar-toos
Habitat:
India, Malaysia, Sri Lanka.
Description:
The tuberous rootstock is fibrous, up to 1 inch (2½cms) in diameter, oval or cylindrical and very firm.
The leaf-blade  up to 6ins (16cms) long, is borne on a stalk up to 4ins (10cms) in length.
Leaves are narrow, bright green, tapering to a point at the tip, wavy or crinkled and with a bold midrib with two parallel veins on either side of it.
This is a tall plant growing up to 18ins (46cms).
Cultivation:
Very undemanding as to its growing medium, it will grow well on any substratum.
Unwashed sand with some peat is most adequate.
Propagation is by seed, which occurs readily in the aquarium.
Other requirements:
Light: Moderate to strong lighting.
Very adaptable.
Water temperature: 72°–78°F.
Water condition: Soft water with slight acidity to neutral.
pH 6.6–7.0.
Comments:
A very hardy and easy to grow species.
The true species is rarely available to the aquarist.
What is normally available is a hybrid.
Being undemanding as to most conditions this should be the first choice of every aquarist.
It requires to hibernate in Winter and during this period the temperature should be lowered to around 62°–64°F.
Therefore the rhizomes should be removed and stored in the manner as described for A. ulvaceus.
A. undulatus is used as a vegetable in the East.
Genus: BACOPA
Species:
Bacopa amplexicaulis
Family:
Scrophulariaceae
Easy pronunciation:
Ba-koe-pa amp-lexi-kow-lis
Habitat:
Southern and Central U.S.A. Domiciled in Cuba and Sri Lanka.
Description:
These swamp plants sometimes get submerged when their habitat is flooded.
The fleshy, glossy, bright green, small, oval to elliptical leaves are arranged in pairs opposed, on an erect, stout, round branching stem which is covered in fine hairs.
These stems grow erect when submersed, but grow prostrate on marshy terrain.
The leaves when crushed give out a pungent or acid smell.
Cultivation:
Best results are achieved by growing in a planting medium consisting of unwashed sand and clay and peat, or any other organic matter such as detritus.
A muddy bottom is greatly appreciated by all Bacopa species.
Propagation is by cuttings which root very freely.
Fine white roots develop from the nodes on the stems.
Other requirements:
Light: Requires plenty of light, both moderate and strong being tolerated.
Water temperature: 65°–70°F is the ideal range.
However, temperatures of up to 74°F are tolerated.
At the higher temperatures the plant becomes straggly.
Water condition: Soft with slight acidity.
A pH of 6.6–6.8.
Comments:
Very easy plant to grow.
Several stems should be bunched together and planted for effect.
Once established they will branch out profusely.
They should then be pruned and if necessary planted as cuttings.
This plant is used as a medicinal herb for purifying blood in Cuba and some Asian countries.
Species:
Bacopa monnieri
Common name:
Baby's tears
Easy pronunciation:
Ba-koe-pa mony-ay-ree
Habitat:
S.E. Asia and subtropics.
Description:
Leaves which are small, round or elliptic, fleshy, glossy, bright green, tapering towards the base without leaf-stalks, are arranged opposite on a stiff, round, fleshy stem.
The stems grow to a height of up to 20ins (60cms).
Cultivation:
Ideally the growing medium should consist of some amount of clay.
Nevertheless a mixture containing coarse sand and bulb fibre or peat moss should be quite satisfactory.
When conditions are very favourable a mass of trailing stems are produced.
These should be pruned periodically and propagated accordingly.
Other requirements:
Light: Requires plenty of bright light.
Water temperature: A range of 70°–78°F.
Water condition: Soft to medium hard water with slight acidity or neutrality, i.e. pH 6.6–7.0.
Comments:
Very easy plant to grow even for the absolute beginner.
In its natural habitat, the plant grows trailing along the river banks or marshes.
The submerged specimens grow with their long waving stems providing a medicinal herbage for the fish.
This species is also used as a medicinal herb in S.E. Asia.
BARCLAYA
Species:
Barclaya longifolia
Family:
Nymphaeaceae
Easy pronunciation:
Bar-clay-a long-i-foe-li-a
Habitat:
Thailand, Vietnam, Laos.
Description:
The round or almost oval rootstock or corm produces a plant with narrow, long, almost arrow-shaped leaves, which are green or greenish-red on the upper surface and dull green on the undersides.
They are crinkled, with brownish-red veins. the long leaf-blades, up to 12ins (30cms) long, are borne on short stalks up to 4ins (10cms) long.
Cultivation:
A mixture of coarse sand and clay with a small quantity of charcoal or charcoal incorporated in granulated clay is suitable.
It will not develop in an ordinary peat and sand or gravel medium.
Barclaya prefers a small content of iron in its soil, but does not like calcium.
During its resting period in Winter, i.e. October-February, the leaves die back, and during Spring sprouting takes place.
Propagation is by seed in the normal manner, as described previously.
Other requirements:
Light: Requires very good light.
Water temperature: 74°–78°F.
Water condition: Soft, preferably very soft and acid, with a pH of 6.0–6.8
Comment:
One of the prettiest aquarium lilies, with very beautiful foliage, worthwhile growing as a specimen plant.
BLYXA

The dark green leaves, which are narrow, ribbon-like, almost like Vallisneria spiralis, are up to 12ins (30cms) long, with a prominent midrib and many lateral veins, and taper to a point.
They form a compact rosette.
Cultivation:
Needs a good nutritious bottom to produce a good plant.
The medium should consist of peat and clay.
An occasional liquid fertilizer feed is recommended.
In ordinary aquarium sand or gravel it will merely survive for a few months.
If the tank bottom contains plenty of plant detritus, this will be readily utilized by the plant.
It can first be grown in an immersed flower-pot in a smaller tank, and then, once the plant has grown to a substantial height, it should be sunken in the main tank.
It should be grown in a large tank, as it will grow very tall.
Propagation is by seed.
Other requirements:
Light: Requires plenty of light from above.
Water temperature: 74°–80°F, the optimum being 76°F.
Water condition:
Soft water with acidity essential.
pH 6.6–6.6.
Comments:
Found in ditches, irrigation channels and shallow waters.
This is a plant for the specialist.
Because of its specialist requirements it should be grown as a specimen plant on its own.
Species:
Blyxa octandra
Easy pronunciation:
Bli-xa ok-tan-dra
Habitat:
India, Sri Lanka, Australia
Description:
The narrow leaves are more grass-like and slightly smaller than those of B. echinosperma.
Altogether the plant is smaller than the preceding species.
These ribbon-like leaves are pale green, with a prominent midrib and usually two lateral veins on either side.
Unlike B. echinosperma, B. octandra grows quickly and develops a mass of greyish-white fleshy roots.
Cultivation:
A medium containing plenty of mud or clay or detritus is essential.
It does not do well in peat or sand alone, though a small quantity of these mixed in the above recommended mixture will be satisfactory.
The easiest method of growing this species is to grow it in a flower-pot immersed in a shallow tank and bring it up to a reasonable size.
Then it should be sunk into the gravel or sand base of the main tank.
Other requirements:
Light: Requires plenty of light from above.
Even very strong light is tolerated.
Water temperature: 74°–78°F.
Water condition: Very soft water which is acid, with a pH of 6.0–6.6.
Comments:
Like B. echinosperma, this plant is found in shallow waters, often in rice-field drainage channels.
This species, too, is for the specialist.
CABOMBA
Species:
Cabomba aquatica
Family:
Nymphaeaceae Synonym: Villarsia aquatica
Easy pronunciation:
Ka-bom-ba ak-wa-ti-ka
Habitat:
South America (Guyana, Northern Amazon region, domiciled in Brazil), S.E. Asia.
Description:
The leaves, with a short stalk, are divided into very fine, bright green segments arranged in whorls round a thin, fleshy, round stem, branching profusely.
The leaf-stalks grow opposite from the stem.
The branching stems grow up to about 24ins (60cms) in length.
The submersed leaves form attractive rosettes, while the few floating leaves at the crown are small and oval-shaped.
Some segments of the leaves assume a pale reddish tinge.
Cultivation:
This plant has some exacting demands as to its medium.
The mixture should consist of a layer of coarse sand, with a thin layer of peat and clay immediately below it.
If clay granules are used, it would be advisable to dry them first in the sun, and then spread them as the first layer, before putting the other layers of peat and sand.
This medium should provide the ideal base for complete and balanced growth.
It is essential that very little disturbance is caused in the tank, and therefore it should be planted in an area where the water agitation is minimal.
In short, this plant needs nearly still water.
Propagation is done by cuttings.
Other requirements:
Light: Needs strong light, and whenever possible direct sunlight should be given.
However, care should be taken to discourage algae, as the structure of the leaves makes them very prone to algae development.
Water temperature: 72°–78°.
The temperature should not drop below 65°F.
Water condition: Very soft water, with slightly acid to neutral pH value of 6.5–7.0.
Comments:
Quite a sensitive plant to grow in the aquarium.
Nevertheless, very much sought after because of its most attractive foliage.
Species:
Cabomba caroliniana
Easy pronunciation:
Ka-bom-ba carol-ini-ana
Habitat:
Southern and Eastern U.S.A.
Description:
The leaves are bright green, finely divided, whorled to a semi-circular shape and arranged opposite on a fleshy, round stem.
The leaves are fleshier and stronger than those of C. aquatica.
The floating leaves, which appear when in flower, are oval or elliptical, and faintly pink underneath.
Cultivation:
The same planting medium as for C. aquatica is desirable.
All conditions as described for C. aquatica apply to this species too.
Other requirements:
Light: Requires good, bright light, but not too strong.
Its light requirement is less than that of the other species.
Water temperature: 70°–78°F, the ideal constant temperature being 74°F.
During winter the temperature should be lowered to around 60°–64°F.
Water conditions: Soft, slightly acid to neutral, with a pH of 6.6–7.0.
Comments:
This species is more popular than the preceding species, probably because of its hardier nature.
It is usually fairly easy to grow.

Easy pronunciation:
Ka-bom-ba carol-ini-ana var. pull-keri-ma
Habitat:
Florida, domiciled in S.E. Asia.
Description:
In most respects this species looks very similar to the preceding species, the main distinguishing characteristic being the reddish colour of the leaves and stems.
Cultivation:
The same method as for the two previous species.
Other requirements:
Light: Requires strong light from above.
This will bring out the most attractive reddish colour of the plant.
Water temperature: 72°–76°F.
Water condition: Very soft water with slight acidity.
A pH of 6.5–6.8 is ideal.

Species:
Cardamine lyrata Synonym: Nasturtium Japonicum
Easy pronunciation:
Karda-mine ly-ra-ta
Habitat:
N.E. Asia, Japan.
Description:
The plant grows from a creeping rootstock.
The stems are wiry, round and branching, bearing round to almost round bright green leaves, with an undulated edge and very thin stalk.
Two to three pairs of thin veins fan out from the midrib.
The runners develop roots from the nodes of the stems.
Cultivation:
Very undemanding as to its planting medium.
It will grow well in plain aquarium coarse sand or fine gravel.
Its fibrous white roots develop rapidly to anchor in the  substratan .
If, however, a rich medium is provided, then the plant will produce large leaves and many shoots, developing into a very dense bush.
It will also develop floating leaves.
Propagation is very easily achieved by cuttings.
Other requirements:
Light: Bright light, but not too strong.
If possible, natural daylight should be given.
This will aid beautiful and healthy growth.
Water temperature: 66°–72°F.

Kera-top-ter-is thal-ik-troy-days
Family:
Parkeriaceae
Habitat:
S.E. Asia, various areas of the tropics.
Description:
This aquatic water fern is a rosette plant which has dense, fibrous roots.
Its leaves are up to about 20ins (50cms) long, and are deeply divided into segments.
They are erect and stiff, deep to brownish green and quite brittle.
Some leaves have buds growing by their divided lobes, and these eventually grow to become new plants.
The entire plant can grow to a height of up to 24ins (60cms).
Cultivation:
A mixture consisting of peat with unwashed sand or clay is necessary for good specimens.
Particular attention should be paid to the water, as it requires a good acid condition.
Clay, sand or aquarium gravel alone is not sufficient.
Propagation is by means of the  vegetative buds appearing on the leaves.
During winter the plant dies off, but will re-sprout in spring.
Other requirements:
Light: Bright light from above and the sides.
Daylight is also very conducive to good growth.
Water temperature: 68°–76°F.
Water condition:
Soft and acid conditions are essential.
A pH of 5.6–6.6.

It will also grow emerse, growing very tall, erect and stout.
Genus: CRYPTOCORYNE
Species:
Cryptocoryne affinis
Common name:
Bronze Baby Cryptocoryne Synonym: C. haerteliana
Easy pronunciation:
Krip-toe-korin af-finis
Family:
Araceae
Habitat:
Malay Archipelago, occasionally India.
Description:
The leaves are lanceolate, long and smooth, emerald green on the top side and purple on the underside, with short stalks.
The rootstock consists of sturdy and wiry long runners.
Cultivation:
The planting medium should be fairly nutritious, with humic matter.
Then the plants will bush out, putting forth fresh shoots at frequent intervals.
However, it will tolerate even impoverished conditions.
It grows well with most other Cryptocorynes.
Like most prolific-growing plants, it will develop lateral shoots.
These can be trimmed to allow main plants to develop well.
Other requirements:
Light: Moderate but not too strong light and the shadier areas of the tank should be chosen.
Water temperature: 66°–76°F.
Water condition: Slightly acid or neutral, with a pH of 6.6–7.0 with a small amount of calcium.
Prefers soft water, up to 8 DH.
Comments:
Very hardy, fast-growing and easy to grow, suitable for planting by rocks and corners of the aquarium.
Species.
Cryptocoryne balansae Synonym: C. Sonphongsii
Easy pronunciation:
Krip-toe-korin bal-an-sai
Habitat:
Burma, Thailand.
Description:
The leaves are lanceolate, long, narrow and slightly wavy or corrugated.
These are borne on short stalks.
The light green leaves are somewhat delicate.
The stout plant will grow up to 12 inches in slow-flowing rivers in their natural habitat.
Cultivation:
This is not one of the easiest plants to grow.
It requires a deep tank.
The tank bottom should contain some clay or mud with small particles of rock or shingle.
A certain amount of water turbulence is preferred, and therefore this is an ideal plant to be grown near the filter outlets.
Once well-established, it develops lateral shoots vigorously, and bushes out.
Other requirements:
Light: Needs good strong light, essentially from top.
Water temperature: A range of 74°–76°F is recommended, though it will tolerate up to 80°F.
Water condition: Acid to neutral condition, with a pH of 6.6–7.0.
Water must be soft and very clear.
Comments:
One of the most attractive plants which can be grown with a little bit of care and attention.
The plants can be planted in flower-pots and embedded in the gravel.
An excellent accent plant for a big deep tank.
Used as a medicinal herb in Burma.
Species:
Cryptocoryne beckettii
Easy pronunciation:
Krip-toe-korin becket-tee-ee
Habitat:
Sri Lanka
Description:
The long, oblong or  lanceolate leaves are dark green on the upper surface and greyish-white on the underside.
They are 4–8ins (10–20cms) long and up to 2ins (6cms) wide, and slightly corrugated or ridgy.
The leaf-margins are undulated or wavy.
The leaf-stalks are light purple or brownish-pink.
Prominent veins on the leaf surface are also purple.
Like most other Cryptocorynes this species will grow robust and stout, with broader and longer leaves when growing emerse (above water) as a marsh plant.
Cultivation:
A mixture of peat and unwashed river sand or fine gravel, or one with clay or loam with gravel or coarse sand, will induce robust growth with dark green leaves.
A light planting medium consisting of gravel or coarse sand alone will produce small, slender plants with narrow, light green leaves.
Another easy plant to grow which does not make special demands.
Other requirements:
Light: Subdued light, though it is very indifferent to any other conditions.
Given strong light, the plant will grow stronger, with deep coloration.
Water temperature: 70°–76°F.
Water condition.
Indifferent.
However, slightly acid water with a pH of 6.6–7.0 preferred.
Soft water with a small proportion of calcium is also favoured.
Comments:
Quite an easy plant to grow.
Growing either on the riverbed or by the water's edge of slow-flowing streams and rivers, this species can be treated as a marsh plant.
In Sri Lanka, however, it is seen growing in several rivers and spring pools with a water temperature of 62°–68°F, showing yet again that most tropical aquatic plants are capable of withstanding wide ranges of temperature conditions.
Used as a medicinal herb in Sri Lanka.
Species:
Cryptocoryne blassii
Easy pronunciation:
Krip-toe-korin blass-ee
Habitat:
Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam.
Description:
Oval leaves up to 12ins (30cms) long are brownish-green on the upper sides and deep mauve on the undersides.
The leaf-blade bears circular dark patches, and has a prominent midrib and lateral veins.
The leaf-stalks are long, green and wiry.
Cultivation:
A mixture of peat and gravel or unwashed coarse sand, or clay or humic matter such as clean leaf-mould with fine gravel is suitable.
A layer of granules of clay at the base of the tank, covered by up to 3ins (7½cms) of gravel will bring good results.
Other requirements:
Light: Indifferent to light conditions.
Generally it grows well in subdued light, as its habitats are murky, clay-saturated rice-fields and rivers.
Water temperature: This species prefers a slightly higher temperature range as opposed to the species from the Indian sub-continent.
(India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka).
The range of 75°–78°F seems to be best suited.
Water condition: Slightly acid to neutral water with a pH of 6.5–7.0 Will also tolerate a very slightly alkaline condition, then the leaves will grow slightly puckered, and turn dull in colour.
Comments:
The species is often found in profusion in the clay-saturated water-courses of rice-fields, murky rivers and ditches.
A very hardy species, extremely easy to grow.
Species:
Cryptocoryne ciliata
Easy pronunciation:
Krip-toe-korin kili-ar-ta
Habitat:
India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaya and New Guinea.
Description:
Leaves are fleshy, deep green above and light purple below, long, lanceolate and up to 20ins (50cms) long and 4ins (10cms) wide.
The plant has a very sturdy and long bright green leaf-stalk, and a thick midrib.
A very tall plant growing in marshy conditions.
Cultivation:
This is essentially a bog plant, but it adapts satisfactorily to a submerged condition in a tank.
It also has a slight preference for brackish water.
Naturally it prefers a muddy tank bottom.
Therefore one must provide a substantial quantity of this.
A mixture of loam or clay with gravel should be provided.
If a layer of leaf-mould can be provided below the top layer of coarse river sand or gravel, the plant will establish quickly.
A small amount of salt should be added to the water to see it really flourish.
When it is established it develops many runners which bear green shoots at intervals.
These can be separated (snipped-off) and transplanted into flower-pots or seedtrays with mud or well-sifted loam.
The plant medium container should be kept very moist to keep the boggy condition.
Once the young plants are about 4ins (10cms) tall, they should be planted in a separate tank, where the water-level can be gradually increased over several weeks until the plant is fully submerged.
Other requirements:
Light: Requires plenty of bright light over a longer period than is required by most other plants.
Water temperature: A range of 74°–78°F is preferred and recommended.
Temperatures of up to 84° tolerated in its native habitat, without showing any ill effect.
Water condition: Prefers slightly alkaline water.
Comments:
One of the difficult plants to grow, because of its above-average requirements, such as above-average light, small amount of salt, and very deep tank.
It is also a slow-grower.
Used as a medicinal herb in Sri Lanka for treatment of the eye and in India as a general medicinal herb.
Species:
Cryptocoryne cordata
Easy pronunciation:
Krip-toe-korin kord-ar-ta
Habitat:
Malaya, Borneo, Sumatra, Indonesia.
Description:
The leaf is oval or egg-shaped, between 2–3ins (6–7½cms) long and up to 2ins (6cms) wide.
The upper surface is dull green, almost velvety, while the underside is slightly pale and glossy.
The prominent midrib has 3–4 pairs of lateral veins running towards the blunt tip of the leaf.
The plant forms a dense bush with many lateral shoots.
Cultivation:
It will grow well in a mixture of mud and unwashed sand or gravel.
A mixture of sand and peat does not seem to be that satisfactory.
The plant should be allowed to grow on its own or away from other species of Cryptocoryne and species like Echinodorus.
The addition of finely-sifted compost or leaf-mould to the bottom layer with gravel or unwashed coarse sand is ideal.
This medium is the one which has been used in many laboratory experiments on this plant.
Consistently, the results indicate that this mixture is readily accepted by the plant.
Other requirements:
Light: Good light needed, especially from above.
Too strong light should be avoided, as it has the habit of developing leaves above the water.
Water temperature: A range of 72°–78°F is satisfactory, though it will stand a temperature of up to 84°F in the wild.
As it is sensitive to large temperature fluctuation, care should be taken to maintain a stable reading.
Water condition: Soft water, up to 6 DH, and acid, with a pH of 6.0–6.6 is ideal.
Comments:
The true C. cordata species is quite hard to come by, the one popularly available being C. griffithii.
However, the keen aquarist should be able to obtain this through a special plant collector from abroad.
This is another attractive species, but extra care is needed to achieve success.
This plant changes its form and characteristics according to its habitat, and therefore specimens from different localities are often confused and thought to be different species.
In Indonesia this plant is used as a medicinal herb in treating wounds.
Species:
Cryptocoryne costata
Easy pronunciation:
Krip-toe-korin kost-ar-ta
Habitat:
Vietnam, Thailand.
Description:
The leaves are long, narrow, pointed at the tips and reddish-brown, with brownish or reddish specks on the upper surface and brown on the undersides.
The leaf-stalks are almost the same length as the leaf-blades.
Cultivation and propagation:
Quite a sensitive species, it has two forms, the emerse and the submerse.
It thrives on a muddy bottom, and therefore a base consisting of sand or loam should be provided.
Propagation is by root division.
The growth is very slow.
Other requirements:
Light: Strong to moderate light.
Water temperature: 72°–76°F and no higher.
Water condition: Slightly acid to neutral, pH 6.5–7.0.
Soft water with a DH of 5–6.
Comments:
Due to its exceptionally coloured foliage, this is a splendid plant for the aquarium.
Though it is a sensitive plant, it is quite a good one to grow, as once established it will develop into a sturdy cluster which will last for many years.
The ever-increasing rootstock produces new plants, which replace the old degenerating plants.
Species:
Cryptocoryne griffithii
Easy pronunciation:
Krip-toe-korin griffith-ee-ee.
Habitat:
Malayan peninsula, India, Sri Lanka.
Description:
Egg-shaped leaves are dark or emerald green on the upper surface and light purplish to grey on the undersides.
The leaf with its long, brownish leaf-stalk is up to 18ins (46cms) long.
According to light intensity, regular brown to purple spots develop on the leaf tissue.
The bold midrib bears 3–4 pairs of lateral veins.
The dense rootstock puts out lateral shoots and short runners.
Cultivation:
Good rich planting medium required.
Peat, clay or leaf-mould placed at the bottom with a layer of unwashed river sand or fine gravel should be provided.
When available, plant detritus in the tank is readily utilised by the mass of roots.
As this species demands a fair amount of nutrients, special attention should be paid to this aspect regularly.
It does not tolerate impoverished conditions.
The densely grown rootstock develops many shoots which grow on runners.
These can be separated by cutting the runners and transplanting as new plants.
C. griffithii prefers  its own company and will tolerate small species of Cryptocorynes, but not larger ones.
Other requirements:
Light: Moderate light essential, and therefore this plant should be grown in the darker areas of the tank.
Strong illumination should be avoided, as this will destroy the plant.
Water temperature: Tolerates a wide range, between 62°–76°F.
Best kept at about 72°–74°F.
Water condition: This plant requires very clear water with a good turnover and gentle turbulence.
Therefore it should not be grown near the water-current of the filter outlets.
Soft water, up to 8 DH and a pH of 6.5–6.8 is ideal.
Comments:
A very good plant to grow.
Apart from the rich medium it requires little special attention.
Hardy and very attractive.
C. griffithii is a good accent plant and should be grown away from most other plants, as it will bush out quite densely.
Species:
Cryptocoryne johorensis
Easy pronunciation:
Krip-toe-korin jo-ho-ren-sis
Habitat:
Malayan peninsula, Sumatra, Indonesia.
Description:
This plant has heart-shaped leaves with long stalks, which are olive green and slightly corrugated.
Comparatively short but broad leaf is not longer than 2ins (5cms).
The prominent midrib bears 4–5 pairs of lateral veins.
This is a stout, low-growing plant with very rigid and distinctive leaves.
Cultivation:
Being essentially a bog plant, it requires a muddy bottom, or one which is rich in organic matter.
The normal composition of clay, peat or leaf-mould with coarse sand or gravel should suffice.
Plant fertilisers can be used occasionally to replenish the nutrients.
Other conditions:
Light: Good to strong light.
This will make the leaves grow brighter, with a beautiful sheen.
Water temperature: The usual temperature range of 72°–76°F.
Water condition: Indifferent to conditions, but preference for acidic water.
pH around 6.6–6.8.
Soft water, up to 10DH.
Comments:
A very hardy plant which, though essentially a bog one, will adapt well to submerged conditions.
The shape of the leaves and the entire plant, with its ability to change leaf-colour under very good lighting, makes this a desirable specimen for the tank.
Easy to grow.
Species:
Cryptocoryne longicauda
Easy pronunciation:
Krip-toe-korin long-i-cow-da
Habitat:
Malaya, Borneo.
Description:
The leaves are ovate or heart-shaped, up to 7ins (about 18cms) long and 3ins (7½cms) broad.
The entire leaf is deep green, and has a slightly wavy edge.
The broad midrib bears 5–7 pairs of lateral veins.
Uneven blotches and crinkly patches are on the leaf surface.
Cultivation:
Very indifferent to conditions, though it will relish a planting medium consisting of nutritious detritus.
It will grow quite well in aquarium gravel with very little organic matter.
Other requirements:
Light: Requires very little light.
Therefore it is ideal for even the darkest areas in the tank.
Very strong light should be avoided.
Water temperature: A range of 72°–74°F is most suitable.
Water condition: Acid to neutral water with a pH of 6.0–7.0.
Comments:
A very hardy and easy plant, which can be grown with most of the acid-loving plants.
This plant is not available on the market in quantity, as good supplies from the Eastern exporters are infrequent.
Species:
Cryptocoryne lutea
Easy pronunciation:
Krip-toe-korin loo-tay-a
Habitat:
Sri Lanka.
Description:
This plant has lanceolate, broad leaves up to 10ins (25cms) long and 2ins (5cms) wide, that are deep green on the upper surface and light green on the under surface.
The bold midrib and the 3–4 pairs of lateral veins are light purple or pink.
A fairly tall plant which develops a thick rootstock.
This species, when grown emersed, has leathery, dark green, shorter but broader leaves.
The leaf-stalks become very deep purple.
Cultivation:
This is another species like C. ciliata, which in its native country, especially in Sri Lanka, grows in or near mangrove swamps and by brackish-water lagoons.
Therefore a muddy medium with plenty of plant detritus is essential.
Even clay with gravel is suitable.
Peat, however, should not be used, as its use retards its growth.
Please also see the conditions recommended for C. ciliata.
Other requirements:
Light: Moderate to good light given from above brings good results.
Too strong light is not recommended.
Whenever possible allow sunlight to filter through to the tank.
Water temperature: Makes no specific demands and thrives in a wide temperature range of 60°–74°F.
Water condition: Soft to medium hardness of 8–15 DH is suitable.
Slight alkalinity preferred, though it will readily tolerate some acidity.
A pH range of 6.5–7.5 is ideal.
Comments:
Obviously an ideal plant to be grown when the water is slightly alkaline, but it can also be grown with the other Cryptocorynes.
It is a very attractive species because of its lovely green leaves with the contrasting pale green undersides.
Species:
Cryptocoryne nevillii
Easy pronunciation:
Krip-toe-korin nevil-lee-ee
Habitat:
Sri Lanka
Description:
The leaves are deep green, very narrow, long and almost oval.
They grow up to 3ins (7½cms) in length and up to 3/4 inch (2cms) in width.
Depending on the growing situation, the plant takes one of two forms.
Either the form with the above-mentioned characteristics or a slightly larger form with longer leaves.
In both forms the leaf is fleshy and dull, growing from a wiry green rootstock with many nodes.
Its habit of growing in dense tufts gives it the appearance of grass growing under water.
It seldom grows to a height of more than 4ins (10cms).
Cultivation:
It can be planted as with most others of its genus in a good rich mixture.
In Sri Lanka the best specimens are always found on the shallower areas of the river-bed and by the water-pools by the river edges, where it is very muddy.
Those which grow near silty areas do not appear to be strong plants.
The aquarium gravel used should preferably be the finest grade available, but not fine enough to impede filtration.
Once established, it produces a long runner, which in turn develops shoots.
These can be separated and transplanted.
C.  nevillii takes a longer time to root than most other species.
While this happens it gives the appearance of remaining dormant.
Other requirements:
Light: Very undemanding.
Moderate to good light will do.
Water temperature: A wide range of 60°–72°F is suitable.
Optimum range: 68°–70°F.
Water condition: Indifferent.
From acid to alkaline conditions tolerated, hence a pH range of 6.5–7.5 is acceptable.
Comments:
Undoubtedly the hardiest and easiest Cryptocoryne to grow.
As it is so undemanding and adaptable to many conditions, it should be the first choice of any aquarist.
It also provides a very good ground cover, giving excellent rich green colour.
Species:
Cryptocoryne petchii
Easy pronunciation:
Krip-toe-korin pe-chee-ee
Habitat:
Sri Lanka.
Description:
The leaves are long, narrow and sharply pointed at the tips.
The emerse form differs greatly from the submerse form.
The emerse form, as is usual with Cryptocorynes, is stout, tall and sturdy.
The leaves are brownish-purple to mauve, and up to 12ins (30cms) long.
The leaf-stalks are purple.
The submerse form is slender, with brown, narrower, long leaves, and the leaf-stalks are brown to pinkish-brown.
Cultivation:
This is capable of growing in most soil conditions.
It grows successfully in silty gravel or a rich mixture of clay or peat with sand or gravel.
According to the planting medium, the plants will develop into several forms.
While a rich medium produces a well bushed out, richly dark plant with thick rootstock, a sand medium produces a tall, delicate-looking plant, with fewer leaves and slender rootstock.
Other requirements:
Light: Prefers good light, but not too strong.
It will do well even in moderate light, though its growth will be slow.
If sunlight is available from the front of the tank, the plant will bush out very quickly, developing many slender stems from a thick rootstock.
Water temperature: 70°–75°F.
Water condition: Soft water with a pH range of 6.5–7.5 is required.
It is one of the few Cryptocorynes capable of growing in alkaline conditions.
It also favours a small quantity of calcium.
Other comments:
Another extremely hardy, easy plant to grow.
The plant changes its form according to the growing condition.
It is a very interesting plant for the aquarist.
There has been some confusion concerning the identity of this species, but until otherwise substantiated the authenticity.
of this species is accepted as it is described in Enumeratio Plantarum Zeylaniae of G.H.K. Thwaites.
Nevertheless it is now considered to be a form of C. becketti.
Species:
Cryptocoryne purpurea
Easy pronunciation:
Krip-toe-korin poor-poo-ray-a
Habitat:
 India , Malaya, Sri Lanka.
Description:
The leaves are long, oval, up to 3ins (over 7cms) long and 2ins (5cms) wide, dark green on the upper side and brownish to dark green on the underside.
There are rust-brown spots or streaks on the leaf-surface.
Faint lateral veins spread from a somewhat prominent midrib.
The plant grows to a medium height of about 10ins (25cms) and is extremely attractive with its mottled leaves.
Cultivation:
This species shows very little preference regarding its planting medium, and therefore the usual standard mixture of some nutritious matter with ordinary aquarium gravel should be provided.
Grown purely on aquarium gravel its progress is very slow.
Other requirements:
Light: Medium intensity light.
Water temperature: A range of 65°–76°F is suitable.
The plant is at its best at a temperature of around 75°F.
Water condition: Soft water with a DH of up to 10.
Should be slightly acid or neutral, with a pH of 6.5–7.0.
Comments:
Though there is still uncertainty as to the true identity of C. purpurea (some suspect it to be a form of C. griffithii), it grows differently from C. griffithii.
The specimens of C. purpurea I received from Penang differ vastly from the C. griffithii I obtained from Malaya and Indonesia.
It is another very attractive plant which can be successfully grown by any aquarist.
It is, however, slow-growing.
Species:
Cryptocoryne retrospiralis (and Cryptocoryne spiralis)
Easy pronunciation:
Krip-toe-korin retro-spi-ra-lis (spi-ra-lis)
Habitat:
India, Sri Lanka, Malaya.
Description:
The leaves are very narrow and long, up to 14ins (35cms), and ¾ inch (2cms) wide.
They are deep to bright green, and slightly wavy.
Being a tall plant with ribbon-like leaves, it looks like a Vallisneria.
Cultivation:
It does not make specific demands of the growing medium, and will even grow on just fine gravel.
However, for best results any of the mixtures prescribed for the other species of Cryptocoryne should be provided.
It takes a few weeks to establish in the tank before it begins to grow.
Eventually the plant bushes out and develops stocky rootstock, and the plantlets thereon can be divided and transplanted.
It also puts out runners which can be used for propagation.
Other requirements:
Light: Plenty of good light is essential, especially from above.
Water temperature: A range of 72°–76°F is ideal.
Water condition: Slightly acid (6.5–6.8 pH) and soft (up to 10 DH).
Comment:
This plant requires a deep tank, as otherwise its long leaves will reach the water surface too soon.
It grows well with other Cryptocorynes which do not grow too tall.
C. spiralis, another species from Sri Lanka, is extremely similar to C. retrospiralis, and is distinguishable mainly by the characteristically spirally twisted bract or leaf surrounding the flower.
Cultivation and other requirements as for C. retrospiralis.
Species:
Cryptocoryne thwaitesii
Easy pronunciation:
Krip-toe-korin thwaites-ee-ee
Habitat:
Sri Lanka.
Description:
The leaves are long and lance-shaped, pale green on the upper surface and pale green or brownish-green on the underside.
They are up to 3ins (7½cms) long and l½ins (4cms) wide.
The upper surface of the leaf is rough and irregularly crinkled.
The prominent midrib bears 4–5 lateral veins.
A small species with attractive leaves and form.
Cultivation:
Undemanding as to growing medium, it will do well with the usual mixtures provided for other hardy Cryptocoryne species.
In Sri Lanka this species is only found in clear, shallow, running water with a fair amount of clay and silt on the bottom.
Other requirements:
Light: Requires good, but not too strong light.
Water temperature: A wide range of temperature is tolerated, 62°–76°F.
Optimum temperature around 72°–74°F.
Water condition: The water should be very clear, but otherwise C. thwaitesii is not very demanding, though it does prefer soft water with a pH of 6.5–7.0.
Comment:
This is one of the Cryptocorynes which grows in clear, cool, mountain streams where the water temperature falls as low as 50°F during the night.
This plant has a long leaf form which is found in the lowlands where the temperature is substantially high.
An attractive plant which can be grown by the aquarist with ease because of its ready adaptability to most conditions.
Used as medicinal herb, especially as a blood-purifier.
Species:

The lighting period from above should be constant, for steady growth.
Water temperature: Needs a high temperature range of 75°–78°F.
Temperatures below this slow down further its normal slow growth.
Water condition: Soft water with a DH of up to 6, and acid conditions, with a pH of 6–6.6 are preferred.
Comments:
This is not a very suitable plant for the aquarium, as it is very slow growing, and also prefers a higher acid conditions than most aquatic plants.
As a specimen plant it can be grown on its own.
It does well as an emerse plant.
This species, which is low-growing and has unusually shaped leaves, is, however, attractive.
Species:
Cryptocoryne walkeri
Easy pronunciation:
Krip-toe-korin walker-ee
Habitat:
Sri Lanka
Description:
The purplish green or violet leaf-blade is oval to elliptical, up to 6ins (15cms) long and 2ins (5cms) wide, borne on a stalk nearly its own length.
The leaf-base is tapering or rounded, but occasionally broadly heart-shaped.
The leaf tip is blunt.
A broad, bold, midrib bears 4 to 5 lateral veins either side of it, which in turn are connected by many cross-veins.
The leaf edge is faintly wavy.
Cultivation:
Requires a fairly nutritious tank bottom containing some clay and organic detritus.
Therefore a mixture consisting of these two components or a mixture of unwashed coarse sand and clay is recommended.

Cryptocoryne wendtii
Easy pronunciation:
Krip-toe-korin wend-tee-ee
Habitat:
Sri Lanka, India, Malaya, Thailand.
Description:
The leaves are long, lanceolate , brownish-green or olive green on the upper surface and pale to reddish-green on the under surface.
In addition, there are short, brown or dark brown wavy markings on the surface.
The very prominent, broad midrib has 3–4 pairs of lateral veins.
The entire leaf is up to 10ins (25cms) long and 2ins (5cms) wide.
This is a medium-sized plant, growing to a height of up to 12ins (30cms), and can be used as a good accent plant, which forms a dense bush.
Cultivation:
One of the usual planting media as recommended for the other species of Cryptocoryne is suitable.
It should be planted some distance away from other plants.
Other requirements:
Light: Requires good light, even strong light to get the leaf into deep coloration.
Water temperature: A range of 72°–76°F should be maintained.
Water condition: This plant is not fussy about water hardness, hut does best in soft water, with a pH of 6.2–7.5, the optimum being 6.5–7.0.
Comment:
This species is very attractive, hardy and easy to grow.
It is also a very fast grower.
Except for its good light requirement, it makes no other specific demands.
Therefore, provided it is planted in the tank some distance away from the other plants, it should grow well.
Species:
Cryptocoryne willisii Synonym: C. undulata
Easy pronunciation:
Krip-toe-korin willis-ee-ee
Habitat:
Sri Lanka.
Description:
The leaves are lanceolate, up to 8ins (20cms) long and up to 1 inch (2½cms) wide.
The upper surface is olive green, while the lower surface is pale to purplish green, and the entire leaf gives the appearance of being brownish green.
The leaf edge is wavy and even crinkled.
The leaf-stalks are brown or purplish brown.
The prominent midrib bears 2 or 3 lateral veins on either side.
The above is a description of the submerse form.
The emerse form is a much stouter, shorter plant with small, almost egg-shaped leaves.
The coloration of the leaves is deeper purple or mauve.
Cultivation:
The same sort of planting medium as for the other species of Cryptocoryne should be used.
Like C. griffithii, C. versteegii and C. wendtii, this species should be grown on its own or some distance away from other plants.
Other requirements:
Light: Moderate to good light.
It will even tolerate strong light, when the colour of the leaves will intensify.
Water temperature-A good wide range of 62°–80°F.
Optimum 72°–74°F.
Water condition: Soft water with a pH range of 6.5–7.6.
This is another species which will tolerate alkaline conditions.
Comments:
This is perhaps the most widespread Cryptocoryne species found in Sri Lanka.
Its habitat extends from the cool mountain streams with a temperature of 66°F to the warmer regions where the water temperature barely goes below 70°F.
It is an excellent, hardy plant, which is also easy to grow.
Genus: ECHINODORUS
Species:
Echinodorus brevipedicellatus
Family:
Alismaceae
Common name:
Small-leaved Amazon Sword
Easy pronunciation:
Ekino-door-oos brevi-pedi-kel-artoos
Habitat:
Southern Brazil.
Description:
The leaves are arranged in a rosette, and have very long stalks.
They are light green and very delicate-looking, having a prominent midrib, several lateral veins on either side of it and numerous cross-veins.
The young leaves are very narrow, ribbon-like, linear and pointed at the tip.
Cultivation:
A planting medium consisting of peat and unwashed sand should be provided initially.
Granulated clay can be added at subsequent intervals to replenish nutrients.
Periodically, the medium should be improved in this manner to ensure healthy growth.
The plant develops long stems from which grow young plants.
If these trailing stems are held down and secured in the planting medium, they root, and then the sections bearing the plantlets can be severed and transplanted.
This method of propagation by layering is the best one for this species.
It can also be propagated by seed.
Other requirements:
Light: Requires very strong light.
Water temperature: 70°–76°F.
It should not drop below 66°F.
Water condition: soft water, with acid to neutral conditions.
pH of 6.0–7.0
Comments:
A very popular plant, requiring ample room in the aquarium.
Species:
Echinodorus cordifolius Synonym: E. rostratus E. berteroi
Common name:
Segment-leaved Sword
Easy pronunciation:
Ekin-o-door-oos kor-di-foe-lee-oos
Habitat:
North and South America, especially Mexico and Peru.
Description:
The light green leaf-blades are broad, nearly oval, up to 8ins (20cms) long and 4ins (10cms) wide, heart-shaped at the base and blunt at the tip.
Translucent, irregular, greyish-green to brownish spots appear on the mature leaves.
The leaf-stalks are up to 8ins (20cms) long and tough.
The plant, growing erect, will eventually develop emergent leaves.
The rootstock is small but compact.
This is a fairly tall plant, needing plenty of space in the tank.
Cultivation:
The same medium as for E. brevipedicellatus should be used, dried clay granules or balls being an essential incorporation in the substratum for the development of strong, healthy plants.
When the emergent leaves are formed, they should be cut back at the bottom at the stalks.
This will encourage new growth and keep the submerged plant ‘bushy’.
Propagation is by layering, as for the previous species, or by seed.
Other requirements:
Light: Moderate to bright light, sufficient but not too strong.
Water temperature: 70°–77°F.
Water condition: Soft water with very little acidity, or neutral.
A pH of 6.8–7.0 is ideal.
Comments:
An attractive plant for the aquarium.
It is not too difficult to grow, provided the correct lighting condition is given.
Species:
Echinodorus longistylis
Easy pronunciation:
Ekino-door-oos long-i-stil-is
Habitat:
Brazil, Peru, Cuba.
Description:
The compact but strong rootstock produces a plant with bright green, oval or elliptic leaves.
The leaf-blade, which is up to 12ins (30cms) long and 4ins (10cms) wide, is borne on a very long, robust stalk, which often reaches a length of up to 20ins (60cms).
A distinct midrib and 3 to 4 thick, longitudinal veins give the leaf surface a ribbed appearance.
This is a very tall plant, requiring a lot of space in the tank.
Cultivation:
The same planting medium as for the preceding Echinodorus species should be provided.
Even a good mixture containing loam and peat and some clay will be satisfactory.
Unlike the two previous species, this one prefers more organic content in its substratum.
Propagation is done by dividing the sprouting rhizomes, which it develops after the first year, or by seed.
These sprouting rhizomes should be removed from the parent plants and transplanted.
Other requirements:
Light: Requires a lot of light with strong intensity.
Daylight is most conducive to good growth.
Water temperature: 68°–77°F.
It should never be lowered below 66°F.
Water condition: Soft water, with very slight acidity, or neutral.
Comments;
Being a very tall and large plant, it should be given plenty of room, and ideally should be grown as an accent plant.
Species:
Echinodorus magdalensis
Common name:
Dwarf Amazon Sword
Easy pronunciation:
Ekino-door-oos magda-len-sis
Habitat:
South America, especially Colombia, Venezuela.
Description:
A rosette of leaves is formed on a rootstock, producing many runners and subsequent shoots which eventually grow many other rosetted plants.
The small leaves are bright green, up to 6ins (16cms) long and 1½ins (approx. 4cms) wide, lance-shaped, sometimes oval, and tapering at both ends.
From the dark or brownish-green midrib radiate 2 or 3 pairs of lateral veins, and the entire leaf surface is covered by a network of very fine cross-veins.
Cultivation:
In a growing medium consisting of very little nutrients, the plant will grow producing runners and numerous plantlets.
But in a very rich medium, the plant will grow very rapidly and send forth its runners above the substratum without producing the plantlets on the tank bottom.
Therefore the plant should be grown in a mixture of coarse sand and some peat or bulb fibre to keep it dwarf, low-growing and encourage many plant clumps, which form an excellent carpet of bright green flora.
Propagation is easy.
Simply separate the plantlets and transplant them.
Other requirements:
Light: Requires good bright light for quick development, though in partial shade it will grow less vigorously.
Water temperature: 70°–77°F.
Water condition: Soft, very slightly acid or neutral water is required, with a pH of 6.8–7.0.
Comments:
An excellent dwarf plant which is very easy to grow, even for the beginner.
A very fast-growing plant.
Species:
Echinodorus martii Synonym Echinodorus major
Easy pronunciation:
Ekino-door-oos mar-tee-ee
Habitat:
Brazil.
Description:
A plant with a dense, stout rootstock which has very long, lance-shaped, corrugated or crinkly, bright to deep green leaves, growing up to 18ins (46cms) long.
The older the leaves are the duller they appear.
A prominent midrib and 4 to 6 lateral veins are present.
The plant is more at home in marshy conditions than in the aquarium, where it will grow to a considerable height.
Cultivation:
The ideal growing medium for this species would contain substantial quantities of organic detritus and mud or clay.
Therefore in the aquarium incorporate a 1½–2 inch layer of dried clay or clay granules.
If undergravel filtration is used, a fine polythene gauze of a fine-mesh cloth should be placed over the filter-plates prior to putting the layer of clay.
The sand or gravel layer should be put over this clay.
Propagation is essentially by seed.
Other requirements:
Light: Requires good light and preferably plenty of daylight.
Water temperature: 70°–76°F.
Water condition: Neutral to slightly alkaline water, with slight hardness. pH 7.0–7.2.
Comments:
An ideal aquarium plant requiring a large tank.
An excellent specimen plant.
Species:
Echinodorus nymphaefolius
Common name:
Lily-leaved Amazon Sword
Easy pronunciation:
Ekino-door-oos nim-fee-foe-lee-oos
Habitat:
Cuba, Mexico, Venezuela.
Description:
This plant with a compact and wiry rootstock bears several forms of leaves.
The juvenile leaves are narrow, ribbon-shaped, wavy, translucent and dark green, up to 8ins (20cms) long, with a pair of longitudinal veins.
The immediately following leaves are longer, wider, blunt at the tip and heart-shaped at the base, with 2 or 3 pairs of longitudinal veins.
The next leaves are floating ones borne on long stalks.
These are oval or heart-shaped.
The emerse leaves when developed are heart-shaped and bright green.
These floating leaves may occur in the aquarium.
Cultivation:
A medium of peat and clay or coarse unwashed sand with peat is suitable.
When mixing the medium, take equal quantities of material.
If the emerse leaves develop, then these should be removed at the base of the stalks.
Grown in sand or clay alone, it will produce smaller, slow-growing plants.
It is a good idea to grow this species in a flower-pot in shallow water and then sink the pot in the aquarium.
This will reduce excessive root-spread and will contain the plant, thus providing a specimen of an attractive size.
Propagation is by seed or division of rootstock.
Other requirements:
Light: Requires good light; daylight is strongly recommended.
Water temperature: A range of 68°–77°F.
. Water condition: Soft, neutral water.
A pH range of 6.9–7. n.
Comments:
An attractive but slow-growing species which does better in emerse than submerse conditions.
Species:
Echinodorus paniculatus
Common name:
Amazon Sword
Easy pronunciation:
Ekino-door-oos pan-iku-lar-toos
Habitat:
Amazon, Brazil, Venezuela, distributed throughout S. America.
Description:
A rosette of leaves develops from a stout, short rootstock.
The leaves are long, bright green, faintly crispate, translucent, tapering to both ends, bearing a midrib and 2 or 3 pairs of lateral veins running to the tip of the leaf-blade, and numerous cross-veins.
Cultivation:
This requires a very nutritious medium and therefore the usual one consisting of sand or clay with peat or bulb-fibre or loam should be used.
Like E. nymphaefolius it can be first grown in a flowerpot and then transferred to the aquarium.
The planting medium should have its nutrients replenished by the addition of clay granules or sun-dried clay balls to the base of the roots.
Once established, the plant will bush out producing long stems giving rise to numerous shoots.
These should be divided and transplanted.
Other requirements:
Light: Requires good light, especially bright light from above.
Water temperature: 70°–78°F.
Water condition: Medium hard water of a neutral condition, pH 6.9–7.0.
Comments:
An attractive accent plant requiring a deep tank.
Ideally it should be grown on its own as a specimen plant.
Species:
Echinodorus tenellus
Common name:
Dwarf Chain Sword
Easy pronunciation:
Ekino-door-oos ten-ell-oos
Habitat:
North to South America.
Description:
Very slender, laterally-growing runners bear dwarf-growing rosettes with grass-like, sometimes lance-shaped bright green leaves up to 4ins (10cms) long.
These slender runners or stems branch profusely forming more and more clumps, which eventually cover the bottom of the tank, producing a ‘lawn’ effect.
Cultivation:
The same planting medium as recommended for all the Echinodorus species is suitable.
It prefers a fair amount of nutritious detritus.
It is fairly slow in rooting and establishing, especially in a deep tank.
Therefore it can be first planted in a shallow container of clay, sand or peat, covered over with 5 to 6 inches of water and maintained at a temperature of around 70°F.
Once the plant has achieved reasonable growth it should be transplanted in the aquarium.
Propagates by the plantlets produced on the runners.
Other requirements:
Light: Good bright light essential.
Whenever possible plenty of daylight should be given.
Water temperature: 70°–78°F.
Water condition: Soft water with slight alkalinity, pH 7.0–7.8.
Comments:
A very easy plant to grow.
Once established it spreads very rapidly and provides excellent ground cover.
Genus: EGERIA
Species:
Egeria densa Synonym: Elodea densa
Common name:
Waterweed
Easy pronunciation:
E-lo-de-ar den-sa
Family:
Hydrocharitaceae
Habitat:
Central and South America, parts of North America.
Domiciled in some tropical waters.
Description:
A stout, thickly-branched plant with slender, fairly brittle stems.
The bright green, narrow, lance-shaped leaves are arranged round the stem.
The leaf-blade is finely serrated and up to 1½ins (about 4cms) long.
The stems may grow to a length of up to 2yds (200 cms).
Cultivation:
Undemanding as to the planting medium it will grow well in unwashed sand.
Being an alkaline-loving plant it requires some calcium content.
Therefore some quantity of clay high in calcium content should be placed in the tank bottom.
Propagation is by cuttings.
Owing to its high alkaline requirement it should only be grown with those plants with the same preference.
Other requirements:
Light: Requires plenty of bright light.
Water temperature: A broad range of 50°–76°F.
Water condition: Medium hard to hard water with alkalinity, pH 7–9.5.
Comments:
This is a very difficult plant to grow with most of the other popular aquarium plants due to its high alkaline requirement.
As it tolerates very low temperatures too, it is also most suitable for the cold water tank and the garden pool.
It grows very rapidly and hence needs regular pruning.
Genus: EICHHORNIA
Species:
Eichhornia crassipes
Common name:
Water Hyacinth
Easy pronunciation:
Ike-horn-nia kras-si-pays
Family:
Pontederiaceae
Habitat:
South America, domiciled in most tropical waters.
Description:
A large floating plant forming a rosette of light green, fleshy, roundish leaves which slightly taper at the tip and base.
The leaf-stalk is thickened with air-filled tissues inside for buoyancy of the plant.
The leaves are faintly veined.
A dense mat of long, brownish or light bluish, fibrous roots grows below the leaf-rosettes and even reaches the soil or mud and anchors the plant.
Cultivation:
Though considered a floating plant, it frequently puts down roots to the tank bottom, and relies on nutrients both from the water and the substratum.
It requires a nutritious bottom and preferably one with mud or clay.
It also needs plenty of humidity (moisture) in the air above it.
Ensure that there is adequate air-space between the water-level and the cover-glass.
Propagation is by numerous runners, which arise in the leaf axils or by side offshoots.
Other requirements:
Light: Requires bright light over a longer period than is required for most aquarium plants.
Water temperature: 70°–78°F.
Water condition: Soft water with slight acidity, pH 6.6–6.8.
Comments:
Due to the high humidity and space requirement it is not an easy plant to grow in the aquarium.
Ideal for the outdoor pool in Summer.
In S.E. Asia this plant is used as a livestock feed, for in natural conditions it is a favourite of buffaloes, deer and many other herbivorous animals.
Genus: ELEOCHARIS
Species:
Eleocharis acicularis
Common name:
Hair-grass, Needle-grass
Easy pronunciation:
Elio-car-is aki-ku-lar-is
Family:
Cyperaceae
Habitat:
Cosmopolitan.
Description:
Tufts or rosettes of fine, needle-like leaves grow on creeping and branching rhizomes.
Each small grass-rosette has a compact, fibrous rootstock very similar to that of the land-grass.
The tufts grow to a height of up to 6ins (15cms) and appear bright to dark green.
Cultivation:
Very undemanding as to its growing medium, it will grow very well even in unwashed sand or aquarium gravel.
Naturally enough, for vigorous growth, a medium consisting of some clay or mud is needed.
It is slow-rooting and therefore it will be several weeks before any growth is observed.
Once established it grows very rapidly and forms a thick ‘carpet’.
Other requirements:
Light: Requires plenty of moderate to bright light.
Water temperature: A range of 60°–70°F.
Water condition: Soft to medium hard water with slight acidity, with a pH of 6.6–6.8 ideal.
Comments:
This is an evergreen plant which will grow in low temperatures and therefore suitable for the coldwater aquarium too.
Easy to grow excellent species for good ground cover.
Genus: HETERANTHERA
Species:
Heteranthera dubia
Family:
Pontederiaceae
Easy pronunciation:
Heter-un-thay-ra do-be-ra
Habitat:
North and South America.
Description:
The leaves are narrow, long up to 4ins (10cms), long, ribbon-shaped, bright green, growing opposite on long, branching stems.
The floating leaves are spongy and swollen, thus making the plant buoyant.
Fine roots develop from the nodes and the plant develops rapidly and outgrows the tank.
Cultivation:
Very indifferent as to its growing medium, it will even grow in fine gravel or unwashed sand.
But it requires alkaline water and propagates freely from stem-cuttings.
It can also be propagated from seed in the manner described for some earlier species.

Leaves are egg-shaped or sometimes ribbon-like, flat, bright green, up to 4ins (10cms) long, growing alternate on a slender trailing and thickly branching stem.
Fine roots grow very freely from the nodes where the root growth thickens at the lower nodes.
Like H. dubia the uppermost leaves float on the surface.
Unlike the preceding species this plant is much more manageable as it is less vigorous.
Cultivation:
Unlike the other species, this one requires a nutritious bottom.
Therefore the usual mixture containing clay or mud with peat or bulb-fibre should be provided.
Usually the lower leaves on the stems brown and fall off.
Propagation is by stem cuttings.
Other requirements:
Light: Requires bright light and plenty of it.
Water temperatures: 65°–80°F, optimum being 74°F.

The long roots reach the tank bottom, where the medium should be rich in organic matter, such as plant detritus.
This is not ideal for the aquarium, though if close attention to the light and humidity factors is given, good specimens can be grown.
Other requirements:
Light: Needs strong illumination.
Water temperature: 72°–76°F.
Water condition: Soft water, preferably about 6 DH, and slightly acid, at a pH of 6.5–6.8.
Comments:
Though not an easy plant to grow, it is a curiosity.
It is a worthwhile species to grow on its own in a specimen tank.
In Indonesia it is used as a vegetable.

Common name:
Ribbon-grass, Tape-grass
Easy pronunciation:
Vallis-nay-ria arsia-tika
Habitat:
Burma, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Taiwan, Japan.
Description:
The leaves are narrow, ribbon-like, up to 24ins (60cms) long and 2ins (5cms) wide, bright to dark green and spirally twisted.
These form a rosette on a small rootstock.
In nature, this species grows very tall in pond, pools, and slow-moving water-courses, and each plant often occupies a very large area.
Cultivation:
This plant is fairly undemanding as to the type of planting medium it requires; a mixture as used for most aquatic plants is suitable.
It will do well in a gravel medium with plenty of detritus.
It requires a deep tank and ideally should be planted on its own, as it does not readily establish well with most other plants.
However, if given plenty of room it will eventually slowly establish and flourish.
It propagates by the many offshoots, which should be removed and transplanted.
Other requirements:
Light: Good illumination necessary.
When ever possible direct sunlight should be given.
Water temperature: A range of 68°–77°F.
Water condition: Soft and slightly acid to slightly alkaline, with up to 10 DH and a pH of 6.6–7.6
