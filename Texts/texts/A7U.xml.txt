Obituary: Carlo Verrri.
Heavy blow to Alitalia:.
CARLO Verri, the new president of the Italian state airline Alitalia, died on Monday night aged 50 in a macabre car crash in the southern suburbs of Rome.
He was on the telephone to his wife in Turin when his chauffeur (who also died) drove the armour-plated car through a red light into a bus.
An eye-witness saw Verri in the back seat gesturing towards the open telephone line and died shortly afterwards.
Unusually for Italy, Verri owed nothing to political connections for his appointment from the private sector only just over a year ago.
The airline's situation was too serious.
Alitalia was facing erratic profits, stagnating passenger traffic and heavy competition on its European and long-haul routes, with Verri's predecessor and the president of the state holding wrangling in public.
Strikes by pilots, cabin crew and ground staff, were compounded last winter by unusually persistent fog at under-equipped north Italian tourist airports.
Verri was not an airline man, but the president of the components group of the Swedish firm Electrolux.
In July he succeeded in settling two years' disruption at heavy labour cost (26 per cent) and in his all-too-brief career he also announced a 5.9 trillion lire investment programme to be completed in 1995, divided between fleet expansion (3.4 trillion lire) and ground upgrading.
However, the airline's firm orders for 20 Airbus A321 medium-range jets and 28 McDonnell Douglas jets will not be delivered until the mid-1990s, and unlike some other European airlines, Alitalia is thought vulnerable for want of international partners and a strategy for deregulation of the European market after 1992.
In the meantime, the airline will be run by its managing director, Giovanni Bisignani.
