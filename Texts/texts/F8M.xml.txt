Pretty interesting!
What kind of social aspects are there at college?
Are there enough for you?
No.
And how would you improve them?
Has it been a pleasant experience?
And how does the college equal generally from your point of 
A dream!
view?
Okay?
That's the subject  have we got equal twos?
Yeah, two, two, two, two.
Yes we have.
Can't do that!
Right!
Don't matter who speaks first?
So when your ready  off you go.
Right, you two, ready?


Quite everybody!
This is Jane.
I'll start again!
Right.
Good!
This is Jane.
Jane  for two years  she's enjoyed the course so far  but she thinks

more like the tables and chairs and
And the curtains.
and the curtains we could have those in.
And, the thing that she er  the subjects, there should be more  different variety of subject she said 
Mm.

Okay.
Next two.

She thinks the college is a complete hole!
Oh!
And  that it's very disorganised  and  you never know where you are  regarding rooms.
And that erm  she thinks tutors don't converse enough  er  to find out what's going on.

She thinks it's very disorganised.
The facilities are okay.
She's met lots of really, very interesting people.


Apart from one!


Thank you!
Erm, an improvement to be made  in the mobiles.
There's not much time for socialising  as it's a long day until five, plus work at home.
And that's about it.
Alright.
Next two.
Oh erm  this is Zoe.
Mm, and she's doing a B-Tech first diploma in .
Erm, she thinks this college is alright and she enjoys coming.
Erm, she thinks our course would be better if it was spread out over four days and not three.

But she thinks  the college is disorganised but the facil , facilities are okay.
Right.
Next two.
This is Nikki.
She's here to do a course care and .
She doesn't like the course  they think the college is alright.

This is Dianne, she's doing an apex course for one year.
She's met a lot of friends here  and  and likes to meet them in the canteen.
Erm, she enjoys staff here and thinks they're friendly.

And  change over and off you go.
Go to your pair .
Right.
Off we go!
This is Lisa.
Shh!
Shh!
She  first   in  Kent.
She likes college.
Would be better if  spread over four days because she  cannot
Socialise.

Mobiles could be made  smar ter  as there's no exams at the end.
Could have  shorter hours cos of the  .
Right.
Fine.
Next two.
This is Sarah.
She had one year of  and she thinks  erm  it's boring, bit of a dump!.
Erm


she thinks college is alright  and she's met quite a few people  and she likes loads of .


But  she thinks sho could be improved, but it's okay.
And er  she thinks the er mobiles should definitely be removed!


And improved .
Right!
Next two.
This is Nikki.
She thinks that the college is alright but it's a bit of hole!
And the facilities are alright.
And it's  totally disorganised!
She's met loads of really nice people and doesn't know where to put her eyes while the blokes walk past!


And , the canteen could be larger  and erm
Yeah.

Yeah.
Right.
Next two.
This is Jonathan, he's a , he likes the  
Quite, the rest of you please!
he likes the college most days.
The organisation is getting better.
The facilities are quite good.
I'd like to see  a bar.


More  more canteen facilities, all that queuing for food!
Lots of people who meet him  who he likes and he goes out with them.
That's not nice!
You said that!they're to put up more  was it?

Erm  it's very organised.
Can't se , that's about it.
Okay.
Next two.
This is Sarah.
Erm  she doesn't think the college is particularly special.
Er  it doesn't look very nice.
His influence.
Erm  she said, she didn't like the course too well  and
.
And erm    er  good place to make friends but at any college you make friends 
 
and from the Exea, Exeter  College  where she  first knew me, so


that's about the size of things.
Right.
Are you dedicated to terms?
Am I?
Yes.
No.
Because  shouldn't be!
Okay, next two.
This is Lisa.
And she thinks the college is a disorganised .
Erm  the course is too jam-packed and she doesn't enjoy it.
. Erm  she could make plenty of improvements, make it look nicer, more organised  better rooms  the people are okay, but that's the only good thing about college is meeting people.
The rooms are badly heated, the facilities are okay and  and  it's been, it's been an okay experience so far.
Right.
Erm  .
And the last two.
This is Claire.
She loves the college!
She's on the B tech first diploma on caring for a year, then she's gonna go to a two year national.
Erm, she thinks it's quite a good course, she likes the tutors and, she likes going out with friends who, who she meets at college.
She has a day off a week.
Aha.
Erm  she 
If I'm lucky!
a bit bad!
No !
But she erm thinks that the way it should be only four days  rather than three.
And 
Ha!
Lucky !
And it could be improved.
The college could be improved a lot.
Right!
I've  all those feelings.
Seems to be all about stop and go!


Right!
Let's now talk for a little while about the assignment.
Maybe, give you  extra help, extra information.
We'll hand out some paper  this is not to make one of these long lists or anything, it's basically to help you to make some notes if you wi , require to do so.
Right.
Yeah.
Would you like to  hand that for me round Claire?
Yes.
Thanks.
I want to go through the process  of  what we really have to do and consider  to build up the story.
Not just the basic elements but let's  put one or two things down on paper for yourselves.
Now, as you know  i when you
Oh yeah!
when you paint a picture  when you paint a picture you put all the information in the picture that you need  to present the idea to other people.
The same thing applies  when you build up a story  in words.
You have to build that picture  in the mind.
Now, if you want to make any notes read them through now, it may be helpful to you if you think can just remember then that's okay by me.
But  I always find, and I think you probably do, if you write things down you remember them easier and far longer.
Right!
Now what I said to you approximately two minutes to the side  that's fine  if you want to know how many words, who kno , who knows roughly how many words in two minutes?
Right!
I'll explain to you.
It is based on  three words per second  as the spoken word.
Oh!
Oh yeah.
Alright?
That is the spoken word.
And three words per second is  the way that television presenters make er, their scripts  for presenting to the public  in a news bulletin.
So  for a minute you have obviously got a hundred and eighty words  and for two minutes it's double that amount.
I see.
Okay?
Mm.
Now I'm not going to be pedantic and say  anything under two minutes is unacceptable  two minutes is the guideline just to give you an idea of what  would be a good idea.
Right?
Okay.
Now  we're talking about whether it can be a story  about human beings  or animals.
It can either be  looking at the animal as an observer, in which case  you can talk about the animals and what they are doing.
Or, you can take the point of view of the animal and have the animal speaking in a human tongue.
The same as  I did mention last week,.
A simple structure  for the plot  interest  and also, or possibly it's quite nice to include a little bit of humour.
So  straight forward, there's something to create a smile about.
Now, apart from a colourful er, magic of the story line  you also need a colourful character  or characters.
To build up a character  you need to know something about that character, what sort of person that character is  or what sort of animal that character is.
Is it happy?
Is it unhappy?
Erm  you need to set the scene.
Now, by setting the scene  we'll take an example, just a straight course statement, alright?
A girl goes for a walk.
That is  just a few words  in your mind you can see a person walking along.
As a story line it's not all  because it doesn't say anything about the girl, it doesn't say where she's going, where she's come from  and what's happening on the way.
So, that's the starting point.
That's the basis of the structure.
From that point on we need to give a name to that person  we need to give the environment, that is to say is she inside?
Is she outside?
Is she walking in a park?
It is good to know, if it's outside, what the weather conditions are like.
Is it sunny?
Is it cloudy?
Are the skies blue?
Or is it about to snow?
It'll be interesting to know where the girl was going to.
And perhaps where she'd just come from.
Is she doing anything apart from just walking along?
Now, you start that building that information into the first statement of the girl goes for a walk.
You then begin to build up a story line, a structure  and something which could be called interesting  and could be the start of interesting idea.
So, using that idea, using that information
Mm.
Yeah, that's .
would someone like to tell me how they would actually  incorporate  that, that additional information into the first statement?
Who's got an idea?
Who can tell me?
I'll start you off if you like.
Right.
First of all, someone give me a name for the girl.
Mildred.
Mildred.
Mildred it is!
Mildred has hereby been born!
One day, Mildred was walking along in the park  it was very, very hot  and she was very, very tired!
Okay.
We've established certain things there.
There are other things we can now add to that.
Who will now add to other elements to that story?
It's hot.
She's tired.
She's in a park.
Her name's Mildred.
The bird's were singing and the
Right.
.
Yes.
That, that sort of thing's important  because it gives, it gives, it then builds up original 
 
ideas and part of the story as well.
Right!
More things please?
Mhm.
The park was crowded.
Right.
The park was crowded.
What else?
And say what the people were doing, like you know, there's people  playing .
?
And, the story line could go  and over the horizon she could see all sorts of very colourful kites flying in the sky  that other children were flying in that lovely afternoon!
Right.
What other things could  what could she be doing  apart from just walking?
What does something that one does sometimes if you're  contented, maybe happy?
Hum?
Hum.
Right.
Hum or whistle.
A whistle?
Okay.


So she was quietly humming to herself.
She seems quite a contented li er, girl, lady.
Have to stop and sit down because she's tired.
Yes!
She could stop and sit down.
an ice cream.
Get a drink?
She was
Right.
In the distant she heard  the sound of an ice cream van  with it's  with it's jingly little tune playing  and she thought  oh, I'd love an ice cream!


Yeah, I, you may laugh but you see if you're writing stories for a, for a young child  then you've got to be explicit, you've got to be colourful  and you've got to talk in a basic language that that child will talk that  like that at that age.
So, one has to take that on board.
So, that is the idea of building up the structure for a story of that, of that, of that kind.
Now, if you can  once again, for those who are going to actually do this assignment for me, I hope you are!
Base the idea and structure building on that  and then increase the incidentals as you go along.
The incidentals being part of  if you want to incorporate some sort of  plot sequence or some sort of intrigue  erm  that's entirely up to you.
Okay?
The other thing that we mentioned last week as well is the moral  message  erm  be it, safety factors  to deal with, with children.
Do it  as well.
I mean you know how a lot of, a lot of these stories end, and the moral of the story is, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera!
Okay?
The  people here, do you actually like er, telling kid's stories?
Yeah!
Yeah.
 
Yeah.
It's great innit?
Mm.
Cos you get a lot of feedback and th and there's a lot of excitement.
Do you have a chance to do it much here?
Yeah, a lot.
Cos 
Yeah.
our, our  are expected to do it.
Yeah.
To like  of children .
Good!
And th the stories that you read are all, all for children are they ones that you're reading from a book, or are they ones that you're inventing at the time, or what?
Well most are from a book.
A book.
From a book.
Normally.
Normally.
Right!
So, what you need to do is, is, is expand on what you've read  and then start to invent things yourself.
You will not always have a book available to you.
But it's nice to be able to invent the stories as well.
It's interesting for you apart from the child.
Right!
We are going to do some miming this afternoon.
Oh!
Which is er  going to excite our friend here!
Trouble is  it's a  !
Yes.
Right!
So split up into  four groups  as wi with  we did once before.
It goes er
Wah !
Oh!
Sixteen of us  so it's four in a group.
Are we playing the miming ?
Are you happy to take groups in that direction  four, four, four, four?
Yeah.
Yeah?
Okay?
So  the first four there 
Watch what we do.
okay?
They'll be group A. 
Oh no!
That's us.
The second group  there, including yourself  will be group B.
See this 
Yeah I know.
The four in the corner  including Zoe
Ha!
will be group  C.
And the last four up this end will be group D.
That's fi that's five in that.
Five.
So  five what?


Don't know!
What is five?
Tell me .
is there five people?
One, two three, four, five.
That's right!
One, two 
Your 
three, four.
That's one, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four, five.
Alright?
Use a five, yeah that is, you're right!
I'm going!
What the hell are you doing like that?
Just thinking of the role plays.
She'll be death of me!
Yeah.
What?
That.
One, two, three, four, five.
You will have used them all .
.


Just one over.
Yeah, I'm putting the extra one in the appropriate place for the role play that's all.
.
You keep, you keep a volunteer.
Right?
Okay?
Right.
Before we do the role plays I'd like to discuss them to sort of, so we know exactly what we're gonna do.
The subject for group A, will be  purchasing an outfit against  your partner's wishes.
.
Oh yeah,don't look  !
Purchasing an outfit against your partner's wishes!
And this, at least, mime.
But before we start  we'll talk about controlling .
Oh I've done this before!
Oh yeah.
Group B
teacher now.
I've done this.
Group B  is something totally different.
Erecting and decorating an Xmas tree, a Christmas tree  and putting the presents on.
We'll discuss that.
Did you hear that group B?
Yes.
Yes!
Right!
Group C  different once again dressing in a dressing room for a play or any kind of stage production.
I will not tell you what the production will be
We got  we got a good then!
but doing it in mime 
Yeah I know.
will be interesting.
And group D, and the reason I've allowed the extra person in your group is  Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, I know there are not eight of you!


It doesn't matter.
Oh!


It doesn't actually matter that much if you leave out Sno Snow White.
The idea of the seven dwarfs thing is  you've got the seven dwarfs and I'm sure you can sort out who they are.


And what I will do is, they are all   presents  on Christmas day.
Oh!
Your opening presents on Christmas.


Oh!
Right?
Okay, let's go back to the beginning.
prepare you now.
Body language  is the most important thing in mime.
  



Now, what's a typical, who can tell me what the typical body language is  that you would prese present or portray if you said  I don't know?
What would you, what would your body language  be?
Shrug the shoulders.
The shoulders.
A shrug.
Yeah.
Right, okay.
Group A, purchasing  an outfit against your partner's wishes.
Now, as near as possible you can do that.
You can go into a shop and start purchasing this item  not knowing your partner is there  and the partner suddenly appears and then  the confrontation starts  bearing in mind you are not 
 

speaking.
This is mime.
Now, what I would like 
That's very good!
you all to try and do this time is to avoid if you can mouthing words, mouthing dialogue.
Mouthing dialogue in mime is an easy get out!
Because you just stand there and hope someone's gonna read your lips so you don't have to do anything with your body!
But this time can you concentrate more on what you are going to do with your body  to actually tell people  via your body  or give them a good idea of exactly what you mean 
Yes.
to say.
Yes.
Try and remember what you had originally on your  on your gesture list.
Try and remember what certain things mean.
What nervousness means  or what it can mean.
And also  what things like, folding your arms means.
Right.
What talking behind your mouth means.
Looking up and looking down.
If you're not sure of anything  and you haven't got your things here  please ask.
Oh could I have one?
Mm?
You wa you wanna have a look?
I haven't got the  for a moment so you'll have to use this one.
Thank you!
Right, Group B
Have you?
erecting and decorating a Christmas tree  and putting on the presents.
Now, I would suggest you start that  physically bringing in the Christmas tree.
Let's say it's a fairly tallish one.
If it's a fairly tall one then obviously on it's side it's gonna long.
Try and think, work out how heavy that tree would be  and how difficult it is actually to get a large tree into  a lounge, living room, dining room, call it what you will!
Call it a !


Erm  let's say that the family  are involved in decorating the tree.
Now, when you're putting on the presents  there are little, there are other areas within putting on the presents that you can possibly include  like  a present's going on the tree, you happen to see your name in it  on the tag, right?
And what does one do  one picks it up  start rattling it like the devil to find a  work out  what it is!
Now, these are basic ideas, I want you to add to these ideas.
Right!
Group C  dressing for a play or any kind of stage production in the dressing room.
You're all in the same dressing room.
Now
it's quite important  to be very specific about how you do this because  it's not just a matter of putting on clothes
Oh!
I mean for one production you may need a wig  another production you won't.
I mean, if you can imagine what the process of a dame in pantomime goes through  to get all that gear on  then that is the sort of thing you've got to try and do in mime.
A few weeks ago  we were talking about lifting objects and the size of the objects.
If you lifted a large laundry basket  think about the size of a laundry basket, think about where the hands would go  then down, lift it up  and if it's full of laundry then it's obviously going to be heavier than if it was empty  but that's the size.
The difference being, that if it's a saucepan then obviously a saucepan you lift it with one hand  and  if it's full of hot water or something then you'd have to be careful.
Think about the , think about the sizes, think about the weights and think about what it's gotta be used for  and that  is really got to relate to the dressing in the dressing room because there's all sorts of things there, there's jewellery, there's hats.
Right!
Going on to group D  the dwarfs, the seven dwarfs.
Happy, Grumpy
Dopey.
Dopey.


Sleepy.
Sneezy.
Ah.
And then take which, which one 
And there's  isn't there?
you want to use.
Now  and I said  alright!
Opening presents on Christmas morning  it's not just a case of opening presents is it?
I mean, one opened a present, yes but 
 
but  are you happy when you're opening it?
Are you hapen ha are you happy when you see what it is?
Or is it one of those presents which 
  

Take the  !
and you can't think of an anything that you would like less!
Handkerchiefs!


 
For the, for the, for the tenth year running Jonathan has just got a pack of white handkerchiefs!
Yes!
What have I got this year though?
Not white, just green!


Right!
So erm
one can in interpret  one's attitude in relation to opening the presents  in different ways.
Their faces.
Did you do it happily?
What do you do  
I mean you must still be half asleep in which it could be   himself.
 
Okay?
Now, this time  we'll think about it
Oh!
carefully before we do it.
So can you get in your groups now to discuss exactly what you're going to do, how you're going to do it.
Very, sort of slow.
Pardon?
Don't just take the basic subject today.
Think of  really think hard about you're going to do.
Include something in it which  no one else is expecting.
Quite difficult wasn't it?
Yeah.
If you take a facial expression  anyone of the seven dwarfs  and you want to try and give a dramatic idea how to present that face or that attitude  to do it just by standing there without curtains opening on you and all that sort of thing it's quite diffi , it's quite difficult!
But, there are various ways you can do that.
If there was a long line of people  number of seven for the seven dwarfs  and they were all standing there side by side and they had their  hands over there face like so  and the altogether, at the same time, in unison  they parted the hand  to reveal  the facial expression  that  is more of a dramatic experience to people looking  than just by standing here .


Alright?
So that you are actually creating the drama for the people that are looking at you.
Okay?
Let's go on to another subject which is  another subject we'll be dealing with today.
And I'd like you, if you haven't destroyed them totally, to use the little piece of paper I gave to you all.
Oh!
 
I didn't, didn't have one!
If you would like another piece
It's alright, I've just looked at mine.
Sorry?
whatever it is that changed.
I mean, you can't do stories one side can I?
I, no, no, no, I didn't need it back.
It's for your benefits.
I'd like you to write things down because I think you're gonna remember them, he says, hopefully!
I've lost it!
If that happens to be on a piece, piece of paper and you want to keep your  it might be a benefit to you later on.
It's there, look.
Right!
We'll end up today by talking a bit about children's role play.
Yeah.
Now, in the past, so far, this term we've covered areas such as the bus role play, which I suspect you remember  the shop role play  of which I'm sure you remember.
Mm.
Now, have you, you, you obviously heard of the home corner, yep?
Yes.
Right you know what a home 
Yes, very well!
corner is.


I'm sure you do.
What we want to do now, can we stand on these ideas and put down on paper  some more ideas of what circumstances and situations you could use  for children's role play.
Areas which would benefit the child  possibly educate the child in a different direction, a different way.
Ways of explaining to a child  or showing things for a child, or showing a child how to do things.
Such as?
Such as buying an ice cream.
has a great education value for children, it helps to form their personality and character, it allows them to exercise their imagination and explore the world of fantasy.
When a child plays a game and assumes another character it enters into a form of role play which in itself is a dramatic experience!
This is all part of the learning process.
With guidance and the use of role play children can begin to experience many of life's situations.
Now, incorporate in your play, there is the, there are the benefits of dressing up  using  clothes that may well be available or using  er, specific  outfits as well.
Dressing up helps to, helps children to find a simple way of changing role and to establish their own identities.
Dressing up can help a shy sh a shy child to lose his in inhibi in inhibitions.
Inhibitions.
Thank you so much Jane!
What a child is  by anxiety to play out his fears.
Wearing specific copies of uniforms also gives children the opportunity to try out occupational roles, such as astronauts, or nurses  as well as fancy roles like robots, or witches.
Right!
So if you can start writing your list of, you have examples already  of other areas that you think could be  interesting, useful  educational, helpful to a child  either as in a group  or maybe it's two children!
