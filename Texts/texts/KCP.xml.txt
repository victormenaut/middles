Press that down to make it sto stay.
Right, do you want your story then?
Yes?
Hmm?
Hmm The Spider Affair, alright?
Knock it off.
The first lesson that aft leave it alone and just forget about it hmm?
The first lesson that afternoon was mental arithmetic.
The girls groaned over this, except the quick ones like Irene who delighted in it, but it meant that there was no need for anyone to open the desk because it was all oral work.
Miss Potts was lenient with the girls for it was a very hot afternoon.
Daryl was glad that Miss Potts was not as exacting as usual for arithmetic was not her strong point especially mental arithmetic.
The next lesson to be taken my mam was to be taken by Mademoiselle Dupont.
It was to be a French conversation lesson in which the girls would endeavour to answer all Mademoiselle's simple questions in French.
Miss Potts left and Mademoiselle arrived, not quite so beaming as usual because of the heat.
She was too  to enjoy the hot weather and little beads of perspiration shone on her forehead as she sat down at the big desk opposite the row of girls.
Sit down, she said and the girls sat down thankfully feeling that the only lesson they really enjoy that weather would be swimming lesson.
The lesson proceeded slowly and hauntingly, the flow of French conversation was not at all brisk on the girls' part and the constant pauses began to irritate Mademoiselle.
Ah!
She cried at last.
It's too hot to make conversation with such stupid ones as you are this afternoon.
Get out your grammar books and I will explain a few things to you that will help your conversation if you can get them into your so stupid heads.
The girls opened their desks to get out their grammar books.
Gwendoline watched eagerly to see what would happen when Mary-Lou opened hers but nothing did happen.
Mary-Lou had neither seen the spider nor disturbed it, she shut her desk.
All the girls opened their grammar books at the page Mademoiselle commanded then Mary-Lou found she had her English grammar instead of her French one so she reopened her desk to get the right book.
What are you doing Mary-Lou?
Demanded Mademoiselle who hated desks being opened and shut too often.
What are you doing?mm ?
I got the wrong book out 
Probably.
Mary-Lou stuffed her English grammar into the back of her desk and pulled out a French one.
The spider feeling itself dislodged by the book ran out in a fright.
It ran almost up to Mary-Lou before she saw it, she let the desk lid with a terrific bang and gave a heart rendering scream.
Everyone jumped in alarm, Mademoiselle leapt to her feet sending a pile of books clattering from her desk to the floor she glared at Mary-Lou 
 
what is this noise, Mary-Lou have you gone mad?
Mary-Lou couldn't speak, the sight of the enormous spider apparently running straight at her had completely undone her.
She scraped her chair away from her desk and stared at it as if she expected the spider to jump through the lid.
Mary-Lou!
Thundered Mademoiselle, tell me what is the matter with you, I demand it?
Oh, Mademoiselle there's a, there's a simply enormous giant spider in my desk   leave it alone, you'll just knock it off  stammered Mary-Lou quite pale.
A spider!
Said Mademoiselle, and you make this fuss and call out so loudly that we all jump in fear.
Mary-Lou be ashamed of yourself.
I am angry with you, sit down.
Oh, I, I daren't,M said Mary-Lou trembling, he might come out Mademoiselle, it's enormous.
Mademoiselle wasn't quite sure whether she really believed in this spider or not.
What with Elissia's deafness last week and one thing and another.
Irene giggled, Mademoiselle fixed her with a glare.
We will see whether this spider exists or not  she said firmly and I warn you Mary-Lou if this is a again a trick and there is no spider you will go to Miss Potts for punishment I wash my hands of you.
She advanced to the desk she threw open the lid dramatically Mary-Lou drew in her breath and got away as far as she could looking at the inside of her desk with scared eyes    
 
Honey you've moved it too far away haven't you?
I can see this is going to be a problem  hmm?
I can't remember where I've got to now.
There is no spider to be seen it had of course retreated to the darkest corner it could find again.
Mademoiselle swept the desk with a searching glance and then turned on poor Mary-Lou.
Bad girl!
She said and stamped her foot.
You so quiet and good, you too deceive me.
The poor Mademoiselle I will not have it.
Mademoiselle do believe me, begged Mary-Lou in despair, for she could not bear to be scolded like that.
It was there an enormous one.
Mademoiselle rummaged violently among the books in the desk.
No spider not one, she said.
Tell me where has it gone, if it is still in there?
The spider was alarmed by the violent rummaging, it suddenly hurried out from its hiding place and ran onto Mademoiselle's hand and up her arm.
Mademoiselle stared at the enormous thing as if she really could not believe her eyes, she gave a shriek even louder than Mary-Lou had given.
She was too scared she wa too was scared of spiders and there was a giant specimen running over her person.
Irene exploded.
That was a signal for the class to enter into the fun and one and all scrambled over to Mademoiselle.
Ah, where is it the monster?
Girls, girls can you see it?
Wailed Mademoiselle.
It's here, said wicked Elissia, with her light finger down Mademoiselle's spine  She gave a scream thinking that it was the spider running there.
Take it off I beg you Elissia, remove it from me.
I think it must have gone down your neck Mademoiselle, said Betty, which nearly made Mademoiselle have a fit.
She immediately felt sure that it was all over her and began to shiver and tremble.
Elissia tickled the back of her neck and she leapt in the air.
Oh, la la, la la, what a miserable woman I am!
Where is this monster girls, girls tell me where it is gone?
There was now a complete uproar in the first form room, Miss Potts again in the second form  room was amazingly exasperated.
What could her form be doing now, had Mademoiselle left them alone, had they all gone mad?
Go on with your maps for a minute she said to the second form who were glancing at one another in astonishment as they heard the noise from the first form room.
She left the room and went rapidly to the door of the first form.
She opened it, the noise hit her like something solid, worse than breaks she thought grimly.
First she could not see any mistress there at all and thought the girls were alone and then she caught sight of Mademoiselle's head in the middle of a crowd of girls, what was happening?
Girls!
She said.
But her voice went unheard.
Girls!
Irene suddenly saw her and started to nudge everyone.
Look out, here's Potty she hissed.
The girls flowed back 
Potty 
from Mademoiselle as if they were water.
Ah ha.
In a trice everyone was by her desk.
Mademoiselle stood alone trembling wondering what was happening.
Where had the monster of a spider gone?
Mademoiselle, really, said Miss Potts, almost forgetting the rule the staff had of never finding fault with one another before the girls.
I simply cannot think what has happened to this class you've ta when you've .
Mademoiselle blinked at Miss Potts.
It was a spider!
She explained, looking up and down herself.
Ah, Miss Potts, but a monster of a spider, it ran up my arm and disappeared.
Ah!
Seem to feel it everywhere.
A spider won't hurt you, said Miss Potts coldly and unfeelingly.
Would you like to go and recover yourself Mademoiselle 
 
and let me deal with the first form?
Ah no, said Mademoiselle indignantly, the class it is good, the girls they came to help me to get this monster of a spider .
Who's she?
Gwendoline, I think, look it's on her  leg.
Hmm  yes.
So big it was Miss Potts.
Miss Potts looked so disbelieving, Mademoiselle exaggerated the size of the spider and held out her hands to show Miss Potts it was at least as big as a fair sized frog.
The girls had enjoyed everything immensely.
What a French lesson!
Gwendoline had enjoyed it too, especially as she was the cause of it, though nobody knew that of course.
She sat demurely in her desk watching the two mistresses closely.
And then suddenly she felt something running up her leg she looked down it was the spider, it had left Mademoiselle a long time ago and had secreted itself under a desk afraid of all the trampling feet around.
Now, when peace seemed restored the spider wanted to seek a better hiding place.
It ran over Gwendoline's shoe, up her stocking and above her knee.
 
She gave a piercing scream 
everyone jumped again.
Miss Potts turned fiercely.
Gwendoline go out of the room, how dare you squeal like that.
No, don't tell me you've seen the spider, I'm tired of the spider, I'm ashamed of you all.
Gwendoline shook herself violently not daring to scream again but 
 
filled with the utmost horror at the thought of the spider creeping over her.
It was the spider, she began, it  Gwendoline what did I tell you, I will not hear another word of the wretched spider, said Miss Potts raising her voice angrily.
Go out of the room!
The whole class can go to bed one hour earlier tonight as punishment for this shameful behaviour.
And you Gwendoline can go two hours earlier.
Weeping, Gwendoline ran from the room.
As soon as she got outside she examined herself carefully and trembling to see if she  see if the spider was still anywhere about her.
Yes.
To her enormous relief she suddenly saw it running down the passage, she leant against the wall, how tiresome of that spider to come to her when it might have gone to anyone else.
Now she'd got to have a double punishment, still she would soon put it about that Elissia and Daryl had planted the spider in Mary- Lou's desk.
How sickening of Miss Potts to pounce on her like that.
She couldn't help it if the spider came to her.
But perhaps, after all it was a good thing that Miss Potts had come into the room and heard it all.
Perhaps Gwendoline might even drop a hint to Miss Potts about Elissia and Daryl putting the spider in the desk.
Miss Potts came out of the room at this moment, she eyed Gwendoline with dislike.
Miss Potts the spider ran away down there, said Gwendoline pointing anxiously to  anxious to get back into Miss Potts' good books.
Miss Potts took not the slightest notice but swept into the second form classroom and the door shut.
Gwendoline felt very small.
Now what was she to do?
Stay out here or go back into the classroom, she didn't want to be found out there if by any chance Miss Graining the Head came by.
She decided to risk going back, she opened the door and sidled in.
Ha!
You are back again, and who told you to come?
Demanded Mademoiselle now ashamed of her part in the affair and ready to vent her humiliated feelings on anyone she could.
You screamed and made Miss Potts white and angry .
who did that?
Amy I think.
Is that how you spell it?
No, it's 
No 
got two Ts.
Well Mademoiselle you screamed, too protested Gwendoline in an injured tone, louder than I did, I should think.
Mademoiselle rose to her in her seat and for all her smallness she seemed enormous to Gwendoline just then, her beady eyes 
Who did?
flashed .
Mademoiselle.
You would be rude to me, Mademoiselle Dupont, you would argue with me  
 
Oh dear.
A good  trio aren't we?
Mademoiselle Dupont.
You would argue with me who have taught here for twenty years you, you, Gwendoline turned and fled.
She would rather stand outside the door all day long than face Mademoiselle when she looked like that .
Alright, I think we'd better give up and have some breakfast.
Oh, but I only had one.
I know but it's late this morning.
Oh!
Mind the yogurt!
That's not fair.
 

It's half past ten.
Half past ten   
Oh!
I only had two!

Mary you've missed Playbus.
Yeah 
I should think you've missed that haven't you?
No.
What?

No I haven't.
Hmm, try it if you like.

But why do I have to say thank you?
Because it's polite.
Oh.

Pardon, pardon.
On my plate yes.
Thank you.
There's your plate.

It'd be a bit hectic for you though cos it'll be, yeah it's cold but  it's uneven ground and that's  
Oh.
Mm.
You w you're not  do you?
. See the thing is he's gonna run us up.
It's only just   Newton Bromswell which is just up the road.
But you see if you take a car it's eight pound to park a car.
Ooh!
But if you go in, if you walk in it's free but you, you can't walk there because it's  well you're talking about five mile out into the country.
Mm.
And although we're not so far from here cos we're  this is Newton Road and the next town on er village on is Newton Bromswell.
Mm.
But you see if you're coming from  Hyam you've got to come all the way through  Chilveston and that way
Oh yeah, yeah.
and erm  cos then Pam ph Penny phoned and said shall, it's her who's the horsy fanatic but  it's lovely.
Yeah we just go and have a pound on the nose you know and er 
Well that's it.
You've got to.
there's about ten  ten runners.
They only do it once a year on the flat.
er Thursday night erm  we went to the gala at the new gala club.
You know  Connells' all been took over by Gala?
Yeah.
Yeah.
And erm they had their opening, big opening night Thursday so  he was, he was  out, he was up at half past four that morning so I thought well  we might as well go.
So I rang mum at four o'clock.
I said do you fancy going out tonight cos it's The Bachelors who opened it   
Ooh that's alright then isn't it?
So erm  so went about  half past five.
We got there for about ten to six.
They had a band called Me and Him on.
They done all Chas and Dave.
 
Me and Him.
Me and Him.
Chas Chas and Dave stuff and Roll Out the Barrel and all the rubbish you know?
Oh I bet that were great weren't it?
Yeah.
It were 
Yeah.
Then we had the local girls that do all this erm  balls and  
 
and twist er you know like the ra ra girls.
Yeah.
And then er as I say The Bachelors come on at  seven until eight.
They were rea they were  they were good.
I mean 
Yeah.
Yeah.
not particularly my cup of tea but mum enjoyed them and they got everybody going and  and then we had a good game of bingo.
We had a sherry when we went in and erm  bottle of champers on the table and balloons and 
Ooh.
Tell you what she's living it up more now than she did before!
Well, you have to make something.
But they've got, we've got a new club here called The Beacon.
It's at Northampton.
And it's massive.
It's an ex-Tesco's warehouse.
Mm.
It's absolutely massive.
But every night they have  every Saturday night they have a cabaret on and tonight it's Renee and Renata.
Ooh!
Oh my god.
Yeah .
Last week it were the  Barron Knights 
Oh I wouldn't have 
Yeah.
minded seeing Barron Knights.
It's, I mean it's all free.
It's for the end of your night, your cabaret.
And the houses are a thousand pounds each.
so I mean 
Ooh!
Yeah.
Yeah, so I mean  if you have a win yeah, and a woman that sat  on the next table to me.
Touching my shoulder  she said to me  I want all the ones, all the ones.
I said go on, you'll get it you'll get it .
And I looked up and said it's here!
And she laughed and she said here  here  here she went like this  and I shou shouted as well.
Mum said good job you shouted, they wouldn't have heard her.
I mean she must have been in her seventies.
But we, we got it and she
Oh good.
she had a thousand pound.
It were nice.
Oh it is, it is nice isn't it?
I mean it's just a matter of you know, being able to afford to go and 
Yeah.
And keep it going.
I mean I used to love me bingo.
I mean once upon a time nothing was , but I've spent  two and a half thousand pound if not more since I've been off work.
Yeah.
You know, the dole don't keep us.
Well no.
I mean it's 
There's no way I mean 
No.
you can't live on the dole.
Not when you buy like I buy.
No.
No.
I mean your joint of meat costs you a fiver don't it?
Course it does.
Oh aye course it does yeah.
So I mean we're
And the rest sometimes.
I went 
Well 
I went down town  yesterday and got some braising steak and it cost me five pounds sixty.
I know.
It's crazy.
And that's just for three of them.
I mean I, four of them.
I don't eat it you see.
That's without your  and that's without your bits to go with it, your veg.
That's right yeah.
And then cooking it.
I mean 
I know.
gas and electric's expensive now isn't it?
I know.
And I keep thinking to myself well something will come along, something'll happen, but  I I think what it is  there is no jobs round here at the moment.
I think what it is is that I feel  if I go into something for the sake of going into it to earn money  I shall be absolutely bored with me life.
I f I shall feel as if we've been from here  cos when I was first married we lived up round the next road.
And I shall feel as if I've got up, been round the world
Yeah.
and come back to, to where I were twenty six year ago and 
Mm.
Yeah.
I don't want that.
I've got to 
No.
have a purpose to go out to work.
Mm.
I mean most people go out to work to earn money.
Mm.
Yeah.
I mean I went out because I mean
The house does get boring.
I I got really  really fed up.
Erm I mean I were working 
 
at library.
I mean that were no problem.
But then when I left library  I just got fed up and  I went and  went down to help Sue didn't I?
And I thoroughly enjoyed it.
Yeah.
Mm.
It's meeting the people.
But now she's left and she's had a baby  and I carried on  because he wanted it, the the new landlord wanted me to  to stop on and help out.
Oh my giddy aunt.
And I would go in and I  I never said nothing to him at first did I?but I just couldn't take it any more.
Mm.
And it was either thinking about the wage packet at end of week which I was at first.
Mm.
And then  I were coming home and I were, I were really awful.
And I thought why should I?
And then on Thursday  I went in to work and I had had enough.
And I come home and I says to him, I'm not having this no more.
I said no,.
Mm.
He says well if you want to pack it in love 
Bless you.
pack in.
And I did and to be quite honest, I mean  it wasn't the money really when you think about it because at end of day, forty six pound  he were spending in pub anyway.
So  I were working for nothing really.
Yeah.
but he he were getting cos you were going out and having a drink er on er Tuesdays Thursdays Saturdays and Sundays.
Whereas now, I mean  we don't go.
You don't go.
No.
And well I, we even considered me and my sister even considered going back into driving instruction.
We went to a seminar
Mm.
a fortnight ago.
It's stupid, I mean I've been a driving instructor seventeen year, and I'm not allowed to teach over here.
No?
No, I've got to take it all again.
You're talking about sixteen, seventeen hundred pound to get you through.
Yeah.
But you see with this bank thing with the government, you can have a loan  I think it's up to about four thousand pound  like a restart.
And it's a free loan for fifteen months.
Mm.
And then on the sixteenth month you've gotta pay it back.
However you decide to, by instalments or by
Mm, mm.
one, one big lump.
Mm.
But at the end of the day, it ain't really what I want to do.
No.
I mean I, I want to get into mental health care.
Mm.
And and erm  if I  I'm hoping I'll like it when I get in there, but something tells me I would.
Well as I say I went for this interview and she phoned me last Sunday didn't she?
I went on the Monday for the, to the house.
Then on the Tuesday I went to the hospital.
And erm  she phoned me up on the Sunday.
She said I'm  I'm just ringing to tell you Joy that you didn't get  you you haven't been successful with your application this time.
But she said  erm I wanna just tell you  all the others  that haven't made it, we've just said well I'm sorry.
That's it.
But, with you, we feel you've got so much to offer  and we don't really wanna just say no and  and  and it would make you feel oh blow it I'm not gonna do it.
Mm.
She said I feel that  there is a place for you in the health, in this mental health service.
But she said  what it is is basically we're all just starting from the bottom because this new idea of where they're buying small homes and making them small communities
Yeah.
erm  they're all starting from new.
They're all been institutionalized up till recently.
That's right yeah.
So they're gradually buying houses in certain areas.
And she said I'm sure you'll get in.
But you see it's like everything else, we're in a recession.
You, you go for a job and there's two hundred people going for that one job.
Mm.
Mm.
That's right, yeah.
There's three hundred and eighty went for a job up the  Hilly Home Where they have the spastic kids.
Yeah.
Imagine, for one post!
Yeah.
I mean Kerry's doing caring you know?
And she 
Is she?
Yeah she's a carer.
What the old people?
Old people and er  and handicapped kids.
Erm  she's teaching erm  she's teaching handicapped now at er Hilltop  School.
Er  seven to eleven I think it is.
Erm  but they are not the really  really disabled kids.
No.
They're, they are the the mental ones.
Yeah.
Erm  
Cos they're mentally sick or mentally handicapped?
Mentally retarded.
Er me men yeah mentally retarded.
They just need a little help like with feeding or  or if they throw a tantrum  
Yeah  mentally handicapped more than mentally sick.
You see the ones I wanted 
Yeah.
to do.
I wanted to work with people that had had er severe depression.
Ex alcoholics, schizophrenics.
Aye.
Where you don't do anything like that.
You just work on a plan where  that i at the er at the beginning of the day you're, you're given your people to watch.
So every mortal thing that person does you note.
Like if he doesn't wash, you don't wash them.
You note that they haven't done it.
Mm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And then you see you come along  where you're pushing them to live on their own and you  make suggestions.
That's right yeah.
And erm I went to a place in  and that's what I wanted to do.
But you see they ain't got no places here.
No.
Erm and it's a shame.
I mean Mencap are all men 
It is really isn't it?
I mean there's there's more people now 
When you've got so much to offer.
Yeah.
There's more people like that nowadays isn't there, than?
Mm.
I think there's gonna be more and more.
Because at one time th I mean you never saw them because they were pushed away in in these 
That's right.
great big hospitals and forgotten about.
Whereas now 
That's right.
th they're coming out into community so you're seeing more of them.
Oh yeah.
And th th there's more but I mean  the facilities for them is there?
Well you see and I've also put in for a job  for the the marina at Northampton which is another mental home.
But that's for a mobility assistant where  I go in and befriend somebody and they employ me to take them somewhere for two hours.
Whether it be 
Yeah.
pictures or  shopping or round the market or just for a walk or  for a meal.
Whatever you  they employ 
Yeah.
me, but it's five pound eighty for a two hour session.
Well you've got to think about going to Northampton.
Yeah.
You're talking about half hour there and back drive.
So that 
Yeah.
two hours is now three.
Yeah.
Plus your petrol money to get there.
Yeah, yeah.
That's right.
Do you want me to fetch a pillow?
No, you're alright love.
There's plenty of cushions  
No, you're alright.
And erm  so you see you're, you're throwing money to get money which is, which is a bit stupid.
That's right.
pointless .
But then I erm  she phoned me yesterday and she said to me have you had any  professional  lifting erm  lessons at all.
I said no.
None whatsoever.
So she said oh, that's alright, I've got it all in me head what, what I've got with you.
So I do believe in me soul that she's working for me.
Mm.
Mm.
But she's offered me a relief post as I say, where I go round and help but she don't know how many hours it will be.
Mm.
But I think I've got to get in and I've got to think well this next six months  erm I've gotta work hard to get in  regardless of whether I go  voluntary or whether I go to a hospital and learn it at me own you know, expense.
Yeah.
I think I've got to put something in to get something out.
I've never been a person that gets something for nothing.
For nothing.
No.
I've always had to work very hard but at the end of the day I'm, I'm self-satisfied because I'm  I'm doing what I want to do.
And I 
Do, yeah.
think to myself well it's six months  I wish I'd have done it in August, now.
Mm.
Mm.
Wish I'd have took it up in August.
Took the bull by the horns.
See six months down the road I could have been there.
Yeah.
That's right, yeah.
You see and
Yeah.
It's like everything e but th s saying that  we had him.
We had him in September didn't we?
And I mean  he took a lot of rehousing cos he come from a  a a family that hadn't really cared for him.
I mean he's a happy little soul, isn't he, in in certain respects?
I don't think he'd been ill-treated, but he's took a lot of love and a lot of attention 
Mm.
to to to get him into a home.
And she said he'll probably take four or five months to settle in
Yeah.
and feel comfortable.
But I never leave him.
He's never left is he, at all?
If I go out I take him to mum's.
Or if, if I go out  Rudy'll stop in.
Or if he goes out I stop in.
It's  he's took our life over in a certain respect
Mm.
Mm.
but he's, he's brought us a lot of pleasure hasn't he?
He is, he's a lovely little character.
Benjy!
Come here.
But er he's hard work.
You can see he is cos his fur's 
Oh aye.
Oh yes.

Oh yeah.

Are you coming to your dad ?
Well my brother  the only person he does it to is him.
He growls like mad at Gary.
Doesn't he?
I've never heard a dog  he don't do it to anybody else.
Sometimes he'll growl at Rudy when he comes up to say ta ta in the morning.
That's because he don't want me to go to work.
I have to bath him two or three times a week.
Yeah.
And it takes me over an hour to dry him.
So he's he's
It's not, no it's hair you know 
It's hair.
Yes that's right.
Yeah.
normally a dog can well it's bristly isn't it?
But this is all hair this is.
And he's like a teddy bear.
He's mummy's teddy boy.
He's a teddy bear.
You'll have to remember Rudy he's had nothing to eat  
He's a teddy bear.
for a day.
He's ever so finicky.
Oh he'll have to eat when he wants to eat.
So he

Yeah.
You know when you've done here, will you come and ?
Do yours.
This wants doing, this room now.
Yeah.
Wants doing again.
I try and do a little bit of everything you know  
I want me 
I ain't a bl builder or a carpenter or a chippy or a tiler but  as I say I I I plan it out, always plan it out how I'm going to do it.
And I take me time.
me two weeks to do it I'm gonna do it and then when it's finished it's done right.
Yeah.
That's it, yeah.
You know?
Well that's it isn't it?
Don't keep scratching.
You'd better take that brolly with you.
My big golf brolly.
Oh I can't.
No, I'm not carrying a brolly round.
If we get wet we get wet, simple as that.
Fair enough.
I'm not carrying a brolly round all afternoon.
Or take that smaller one.
No.
I hate things in me hand.
I'm only gonna take some money in me pocket.
There you are.
Poor old Rudy, skint again.
 
There's something to be said about that.
You mean poor old Joy.
Well I had to come down on his side.
I've got to spend afternoon with him haven't I?
Don't come down on his side.
 

Well as I say I hadn't, I hadn't planned on going anywhere.
I erm  I just said to him 
You get off Joy.
Enjoy yourself.
I said to him you'll have to go and get me some money cos I  I ain't got hardly any.
And erm so he reluctantly went down the bank and got me a tenner.
And there's tear stains on it but I'll put up with that.
 
Ah of course you can.
Tenner'll do.
Look.
I mean he's even marked it look.
Yeah.
Where he kissed it goodbye.
Have you noticed George has stopped smoking?
Have you noticed I have?
Oh yeah.
Good luck 
Yes.
Have you noticed Rudy hasn't?
And he said he was gonna do.
Oh I have a, have a cigar when I  when I have a pint.
W how long you been packed up?
Two years.
Two year.
Yeah I were gonna say 
No you 
two year in June.
Cigarettes.
 
since we saw them, that's right.
Yeah.
Yeah I'm sure you'd packed up last time I saw you.
That's why I didn't erm notice.
I packed up  I packed up for two and a half years  and then erm  when we went to Spain in August, no in October, the four girls went  me and me two sisters and a friend from work, Barbara.
We went to Spain and erm the smell of the fags, it absolutely poured with rain for four days and nights.
And I mean in Spain it rains.
Mm.
And erm we were l we were stuck in the villa, right up in the mountains  er, could do nothing but play cards all day and  scrabble and erm  all these stupid board games.
But erm  and I just felt oh  fancy all this way just to come and sit and play cards.
But  we had a good time.
It were nice just to relax and  I started smoking again and I packed up last Sunday.
I thought that's it.
I can't afford to keep chucking two quid down the drain.
And I knew they'd go up again on  on Wednesday.
The budget mm.
So I thought that's it, I'm gonna pack up.
So we're watching that programme, Is this Your Last Cigarette? or whatever it were called last Sunday on the telly and I thought  I'm stupid cos in six month's time I shall say I could have packed up six months ago.
So I thought well if you're gonna do it in six months
Mm.
do it now.
So I 
 
I just packed up and  never thought any more about it.
Couple of occasions I've felt  haven't I?
I've said I could do with a fag
Yeah.
but I won't, I won't relent.
I'm I'm too, I'm quite stern that way.
I was just stupid but I was as I say, since Oct erm  when was it?
Since September  I've had hell and high water with my sister.
It's been dreadful  to say the least.
Mm.
And erm  well she's gone down from what?
Twelve and a half stone?
She must be eight and a half.
Ah!
Christmas  no  new year's eve  we went to a party.
It were my  other sister's  daughter's eighteenth and she'd booked up a party  at the club.
So erm  we went over.
Ten to twelve my sister said I'm going home.
She said I couldn't see the new year in.
She said it's too painful.
So I said alright then 
Is that still switched on?
Yeah.
Switch it off.
Yeah .
And then erm and then er  when we went out, mum was in bed with fl pneumonia, well near pneumonia.
Wen er Wendy had gone.
Mum had got Benjy so I thought  we'll pop up, see mum, get the dog.
And as we come out I said to Rudy I feel we ought to go up and see if Wendy's alright, cos she was a bit upset at quarter to twelve.
So he said alright then.
And we drove round and she's got a bungalow and all  she's got these curtains that all cross over and when you sit outside it don't look as if there's any lights on.
But luckily enough I got up and walked round the back and I could just see  the lights on in the living room downstairs.
And erm  I called out to her through the letter box  and she come.
And she said I'm on the phone, will you talk to that person on the phone.
I said who are you on the phone to?
She said the Samaritans.
She said I just wanted to commit suicide.
She said I don't want to live any more Joy.
So of course that was it.
I said right come on, you're coming home with me.
That's  end of subject.
She said I can't I've just had a sleeping tablet.
And she said erm  I don't, I don't  I don't want to she said.
And we sat about an hour didn't we?
It must have been nearly an hour.
And I says come on, let's go up my house.
I said I, I'll make the bed up when we get home.
Anyway in the end I just said that's it.
I've had enough.
Switched the fire off.
Grabbed hold of her.
Grabbed her handbag.
Marched her out of the house in her dressing gown and  these great big slippers, you know, these with a funny face on.
Then we sat here till what, gone four?
Didn't we?
Talking.
Mm.
Then she got strong again.
She gets these  pangs where she can't cope when she's on her own.
But then when I'd strengthened her up I said  she'd be alright for a few days.
And then she phoned me up.
Said I can't cope again.
I'm down, down the pan.
And that's how it's swung.
Roundabouts and swings all the while.
You wouldn't have thought he'd have walked out would you?
No.
Cos they seemed, seemed so happy.
Well  .
So erm  as I say she's er
and take you all up there?
Yes if you'd just slip us up, will you?
I must go and get a tissue.
handkerchief round here.
I don't iron but at least it's done.
Enjoy yourself.
Yeah.
So erm 
And win something.
Yeah.
We only put fifty P on.
End of the big spenders.
It's only fif the maximum bet's about two quid I think, something like that.
Come in .
Ooh ooh come in.

But I've got to have a maxi boiler first.
A maxi boiler?
Mm.
What's that for?
Combination .
Oh a combination but  well I don't know do I?
Come on?
A combination boiler.
What for your  water and hot 
Yeah.
Have you got radiators then?
Yeah.
Oh we've got radiators.
Central heating but it's a back boiler.
Gas fired isn't it?
Back boiler .
Oh I see.
So you want a balanced flue like  this one of mine?
Yeah.
Cos our back boiler's about had it.
Did you shut him out?
Shut him in.
 
I shut him in.
Oh.
Come on then darling.
So erm  you see that's, that's why when we had  this we paid somebody to put this in cos the gas company wouldn't put my  my boiler right out the back.
He said oh no, you've got to have it here in your kitchen.
I said I don't want it in me kitchen, bloody great horrible thing like that.
No.
So erm  so we decided  I wish we'd have had erm  I wish sometimes we'd have had that radiator on that wall.
Mm.
Cos it don't half limit you to having a radiator that length.
Mm.
Yeah.
That 
And there's nowhere else I can put me furniture.
Cos if you put  the suite, the settee over there it's gonna absorb all the heat into the settee.
That's right.
You're the same with, you're the same as us cos that's where my radiator is, underneath the window.
And all it 
That's where they normally put them.
That's where they normally are.
That's right.
But you see I, I'd have preferred it on back wall.
Mm.
But there again, having it on back wall where stairs is, it's still gonna make  you're gonna still be putting things in front of it.
In er in my room.
So where else is there to put it?
Really.
I mean that's the only thing in here  you can't put  I mean I could do away with me birds and have another single chair standing there, but it shortens your room
That's right.
all the time.
You see that's what's happened with mine.
My suite's far too big for that room.
Far too big.
Well this one is a wee bit I think.
So
I wouldn't say so.
I wouldn't say so.
It's just that I sometimes think oh I'd love to have a change round but
But y yeah you can't cos
You're limited cos that wall is wasted really isn't it?
Mm.
And this wall's wasted cos of this.
I mean you can't put that settee here because it  it blocks that door.
Mm.
So that's the only place it can 
Yeah.
really fit.
Mm.
Mm so  I wanna try and get it decorated this, this year.
Yeah.
It's getting ever so yellow.
Mind you, we all used to smoke.
Mm.
The girls come.
Surprising how dirty things get when you smoke isn't it?
Oh it is yeah.
Oh aye.
What are you going to do Joy.
Are you taking wallpaper off?
Mm.
You're gonna take it off?
Oh yeah.
I'd like to halve it like, like erm  erm  I've done me bathroom.
I'd like  a nice plain one at the top and a patternedy one at the bottom with a nice thick border about as wide as that all the way like on the dado.
Mm.
So erm  and then it really wants, it's it's up here where it's so
Yeah.
getting dark.
But this takes quite a few rolls of paper.
Yeah.
What did we say, fourteen?
I don't know.
It's quite a few.
You're talking about sixty, seventy pound.
Mm.
To do it at the cheapest.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
You used to buy Viv two rolls of wallpaper a week didn't you?
Keep her quiet.
 
Mm.
Used to love it.
Did you?
Love paper, what you loved the art of wallpapering?
Mm.
Did you?
I loved painting and papering and  having something  to achieve at end of it.
Mm.
I used to love to sit back and see it done.
Whereas now  I mean then I could afford to have done it.
I mean in flat, you'd have loved my flat wouldn't she?
You really would have loved it.
I can't live in the muck of it all the while.
I hate it.
No.
Yeah that's what's getting to me.
You see now our Judy's gone, I mean she weeed everywhere and  there were nobody had got the heart to  to do anything about it.
And  now we've come to stage whereas  I mean I were cleaning carpet  every minute of day.
Mm.
Just mopping up after her.
Well you've gotta be clean  
erm 
Stop scratching 
And er getting back to that and cleaning it with a real good clean every single week.
And now, I mean  I'm wanting to do, I I've got it  to stage where it's comfortable.
But I haven't got it to stage where I want  want, I want it like now I want it like me flat.
Mm.
I really do want it like me flat and I can't get it like that.
Sometimes you can't do it that way though can you?
They don't they don't 
No.
there's  the sh I mean the shape  that, that bed in my spare room, it's really filled the room right up.
Whereas originally I didn't want a bed up there, I wanted a bed settee.
Yeah.
One so that I can  go up there and sit and read and erm  sit and knit and er learn to type
Mm.
and do me studying.
But
I mean for the price of that bed, I mean you couldn't go far wrong though.
Oh no.
 
It's a lovely high bed isn't it?
Yes it's, it's got four drawers.
Yeah underneath, yes.
Yeah.
It's a, it's a lovely my 
I give twenty five quid for that.
Eh?
Yeah.
Well if you ever get another one, for twenty five quid
as high as that  get it me and we'll send you the money straight down w in fact we'd be down for it.
Twenty five pound.
That's with the headboard.
Yeah.
Oh my giddy aunt.
I went to fetch it in the van.
And the mattress is like new.
In that little van.
Mm.
Good grief.
It's just two pieces.
Yeah.
And the mattress.
four drawers.
You see it's it's high whereas  I mean I bought a high bed, but even my bed's not as high as that.
Have you seen that one up there?
Mm.
Why do you like a high bed?
Just the getting on and off of it?
Mm.
Yeah it's easier for me to get in and out of bed of.
Mm.
Higher it i well the lower it is 
Well you can see how new it is cos the cupboards have never had nothing in them I don't think cos they're just, there's not a mark in them.
The lower the bed is, the harder it is for me to get out.
Yeah.
He has to pull me out.
Drag me out.
Whereas  if it's at high level I can get me legs out.
Er yeah.
Let them dangle on to floor.
And then 
Let the circulation go.
I'm I'm  I'm like that you see, I'm straight on up.
And only thing I do is get hold of windowsill to get out, and I'm alright.
But if it's a low bed 
You've had it.
there's just no way.
He has to  hoist me up.
Mm.
Well as I say I went out and erm  I thought, well Jill phoned and she said  at the time my mum had got a boy that was sleeping rough down the sandpits.
Erm, with nothing.
No  no covering or nothing.
He were only a young boy, seventeen year old.
His mum and dad kicked him out, they didn't get on together.
So erm mum went down one day and he was there and she said  he were with my sister's boy, they were both sleeping rough.
And my mum said to Adrian I don't like you sleeping down here.
She said it's bad enough  you know, being er sleeping rough without sleeping down here with nothing.
So  she, she phoned Wendy and said you know, this is ridiculous.
So they got him a tent, and they put it at the top of my mum's garden.
And then erm  eventually Adrian got a job.
He worked at the hotel didn't he?
As a chef.
Yeah.
And the other one, seeing as it was like September October, getting cold, my mum said well the bed's empty, you might as well come in for the winter and stay here.
But erm  he sh he went about  did he go just before christmas or just after?
He left just before.
Can't remember when he went but my  my sister wanted to come down but course she couldn't come to mum's because he was there.
And I said well if y why don't you come to us?
We can always make a bed, you know, for a couple of days.
And erm and say I went shopping and I I saw that and I liked it and I thought oh  I'll go in and ask how much it is, he said give us twenty five quid for it, you can have the lot.
So I said well that's fair enough.
I come home and told him.
Mm.
He went and fetched it up for me.
I phoned Jill, I said I've got a bed for you.
I went down and bought  a quilt and new pillows.
Only cheapy ones but, you know, enough to cover.
That's all you need isn't it?
But when the heating's on you don't need much 
No.
So erm I was thrilled to bits cos that long cupboard that's in that bedroom, that  from the same person that we got the table from.
Mm.
So we're really pleased with that cos it's absolutely ideal.
But it's  too big for that small room really.
Yeah.
But I didn't want it down here.
And it, that's the only place it could have stood, there.
Mm.
And again it would have been  it's wrong for this room.
You can see it's  
That's right.
Yeah it is, yeah.
But er so there's always things you can do.
I mean I'd like to get  I'd like to get some more  pots and things for the patio and fill them up and I'd like to get a trellis on the  side of the house with all flowers and that on there but
It takes time doesn't it?
You've gotta do it when you can afford it.
Mm.
We went over my sister-in-law's erm  I you, you've never met Joe have you, my brother?
No.
They've got a, they've got a  a house in erm  Rotten Row in .
And erm  he's got a massive paddock at the back of his garden.
Erm, oh you could get what?
Six bungalows on it couldn't you?
Easily.
six.
Eh?
six .
Yeah well you're talking about four  and I'm talking about six bungalows.
I'm trying to give you an idea of how big the field is.
And erm  they started to  develop the land all round Joe's cos there was nothing behind him, only fields.
They started to develop and they found saxon bones.
So they've had five years  this is not re , this is not  just recently.
As now, yeah.
No this is going back about  ooh ten years ago.
Mm.
So of course they couldn't do anything.
And erm my brother said well you've gotta give me some  they told Joe nobody had got to go on it  from his property and nobody had got to step on it because .
So Joe said well it's no good you doing that.
My kids have got a paddock, where they play.
They kick the ball, it goes over there.
He said they're gonna fetch it so you tell me where I can go and then I'll make sure that the kids don't go.
So it was a law.
You know they, nobody ever went only Joe.
They'd g got these white flags
Well he's not had a holiday since our Craig was thirteen months old and we went to Ibiza
Why?
and we've never had an holiday since then.
Why's that?
I, it, I, twice two years on trot I've booked for him to go with me, and he won't go, he cancels it every time.
So I said that if he, if he went with Rudy, I know he'd have off  and he just grins don't you?
Toe rag
He's a little toe rag.
I'll tell you what, I love my holiday when we went on our own and it's the best time we've ever had.
I find I relax more when I ain't with Rudy because er
Yeah
he can be so stubborn sometimes and, and you know the other
bores him, but he won't and then it pulls me, I want to do what the majority wants to do and then he don't and I feel guilty cos I think oh I should be with him, but 
Well as I told, told Rudy and apparently we both the same, I'm not a sand seeker, I
I, I, the trouble is with me
I liked to go on it
I don't like to get stuck in the place on the same open road, and I like when I go on holidays right
You see it
I like to get out, you know
mm
do things out, you know, this is me, because this is what a holiday for me is, is all about get away off the regular routine of 
Yeah 
you know, thinking they will, oh christ you know what am I sitting down here for doing that anyhow, I could of been done that at home before I didn't have to 
Yeah, that's right I mean there's no point in going away and, and sitting on beach 
That's how I look at it 
and just
Oh I go down beach for a few hours really 
 
that's right, two or three hours 
I mean which we did the last time we went we went down the, the beach and so on down the
 
Oh I 
we had the old beach beds and we eat out over there 
Yeah
and it's really nice.
I mean that when we went to Italy, when me and our Terry went to Italy last year  erm  first thing in the morning we'd, we'd have our breakfast, then we had a wander round  and then we went on beach, two or three hours in and out at the
there and then we went back had a shower  went and had something to eat cos it was only like bed, breakfast and evening meal, went and had something to eat and then
sat around a little bit, got up and had a walk, find a
where we were going, I mean it were, it were like concrete
but it were so nice, er, there wasn't er, er  there wasn't anywhere where you could go.
But you see the difference being you don't drive do you?
No, so we couldn't 
Well you see 
get out and about
when you go into the villa, A you've, got to have a car because there's not a shop and B you're a long way from the airport and if you get taxis you're talking about fifty pound a touch from the airport, so that's twice, so there's a hundred pound gone already 
 
That's right, yep 
so that's all it'll cost you for a car
Yeah
so you might as well have a hundred pound for a car
Got a car then you can go everywhere 
can go everywhere .
That's right.
Because if you go down to the shop it's a thir a ten, a ten, ten pesetas 
Yeah ten, ten quid 
which is a fiver
a fiver
That's right
and then that's a fiver, and then you've got the worry of and you got you got to go shops because when it's so hot things go stale you've got to have 
That's right 
fresh bread every day in Spain 
yeah 
cos bread goes, although she's got a freezer and a washing machine and everything at the villa, so she's, she sold her house in Jersey and they're gonna do the villa up because they, they've sold it Christmas didn't they?
They sold it Christmas Eve day it was gonna go through the twenty third, Christmas, the day before Christmas  erm it was gone and they were supposed to fly over to Spain and they were gonna, gone, exchange a contract to sell it and then she phoned me back and she said I've got some good news for you, we've decided not to sell, it's so beautiful up there and it's called Los
no, Los, mm
Erm  Los Aldos 
Los Aldos
It means the height
Yeah, but, when you're up there you're in the eagle valley, and you get all these beautiful eagles right above you just soaring all over you, they're beautiful aren't they?
The birds and it's so peaceful, I mean you can go out the villa and walk and walk and walk and walk 
 
all the way up to the mountains, you could walk so far you could nearly cross over and go to another village right up the mountains, just keep walking and walking for ever, or you could go into the 
If you're enjoying yourself , enjoying myself I mean, we like to go you know, like place like museums see the history of the place you know 
Yeah, yeah 
things, I mean where we went to
we wanted to go to the erm  where they make the wine and so on 
We wanted to go to the Bri , Bristol Cream and Sherry 
 
Bristol Cream Sherry, factory 
It was right there and you know and
We went to the see the erm 
Thing's like, I like that cos when we went to Italy we went to that Madam whatever, it's a big erm 
hyper, like a big hypermarket so it's called 
Yeah

We went, we went up the mountains er a fabulous hotel

It weren't a tenner each, must of been  I would say about six quid each 
I think the leg of lamb was four hundred pesa erm eight hundred pesetas which is four quid 
Four quid 
and then your starter was about well your starters are dear because sea food is
That's right, yeah
but 
didn't thought of that
you could eat at anywhere in Spain for less than a tenner any day
Yeah 
then you go, er Val's got places of interest booked in her place where if she's gone somewhere like, if she comes home and gotta a little book in the cupboard she might then, then the place, follow the road to the
so many kilometres, look to the right you'll see such and such follow the road round to the right and you'll find it, go to restaurant  Alpalo or whatever and

You see Pam and them was going to a bull fight but I don't like
I don't like bull fights, erm I don't think I, I could cope with one of them
No I don't think
anything else but that
You see when you go down the bottom of the sea where the villa is you just go over the roundabout, and it, you just go straight over and that's all the 
What's the sea Pacific?
Mediterranean
Yeah
Mediterranean
Yeah
all the way, you look one way as far as you can see and you, when you go to Gibraltar you're only a few miles from Africa
Yeah
 
Are you?
of Africa
on the  Peonies on the Peonies
 
you can go over to Africa on a day trips from down there, but you have to have a full passport you can't 
that's right 
go on a yearly passport
Right oh
so it's, you have to have a full passport, well we were gonna do it this year but Robert and Wendy only had a yearly passport
Yeah
didn't they?
So we didn't get over, there's so much you can do, we went to the erm, er to see the dancing horses, you know the
dancing horses
Mm
The stallions
Penny that come today she's a horse fanatic, she's only just sold her own, her own horse, but oh they're out of this world, absolutely, weren't they, they were just stunning.
Absolutely, the things they get those horses to do.
You go up to 
which is a long ride it's nearly four hours away from the villa weren't it?
Yeah
We left there, we left about half five, six in the morning didn't we and we were getting lost in  and we knew it was in the village in that town but we couldn't find it and we kept getting lost so we all pulled her up and he went back and he said to this man can you tell me where the 
Went in this yard this place had oh lovely gates and I walked through straight up to the house and ring the bell, and it's 
 
Because we asked, we come to see the  horses and he said well if I tell you he, he, he was English weren't he?
Yeah, yeah
He said you go down here and down there and he said down 
down here and you've gotta turn right at the 
he said I'll tell you what, all this messing about get in your car and I'll come, so he got his car out the garage 
he got his car out , beautiful Mercedes
What?
Yeah
and took us to the dancing horses and then 
took out and showed us how 
just dropped us and waved to us
Have a nice day
yeah ever so friendly, mind you you find people like that though, you know don't you?
I mean you want to see his house I mean it was set back off the road and you see the people pull ploughing
you know round the entrances
Ah
and then, they, how they've got their money from their own blood, not everything up there you know
was he, he was coming over from er South Africa ain't he, on fourth of April, me mum's eighty on first of April and he's coming on fourth.
I wanna see that then the bungalow's got four, five bedrooms?
Four or five bedroom bungalow and all trees in garden
Because I don't know, I don't know where, where South Africa is getting to, I hope they're going to something stronger
It's not the sort of place I would like to live and have
He loves it
He loves it
Is that his own house then?
No it's er, no it's er
What does he work out there?
Yeah
We've not seen ought
He's my boss
Is he?
We've not seen
yeah
He hasn't been home for twelve months
It just means, no
once
but he, he, I mean we've not seen him  he's been away four years, I know he's been coming home first, for holidays, visit, but he's not been at home because, well we moved into that house, if you remember we moved
that's right, but, when we moved into that house  erm  I conned him I says er are you gonna give us er ten quid for a new house?
To buy some mud and he says considering he's gonna
I says my god I says it'll never be known that my brother said that you can be anything and that was first thing he ever gave me.
You see, what does he do again?
He, does he own the company?
Well he had shares in it, or something he said 
So how's that you're still with the same company you're all
are you away from home as much as you use too be?
Are you?
Are you?
I'll travel it tomorrow I
Do you, and where are you this week?
You, it all in different places?
I get worried when he does things because when he's working like he's working and he's travelling like he's doing  I'm, he goes Monday morning, he comes back Friday, by the time we've done our shopping Saturday, he's, he's, if we go out Saturday night it's what, eleven, twelve o'clock or more, it's gone twelve o'clock usually after he's gone and he's back up then.
Do you work every night then George?
And he travels with it and I'd rather him not.
I do more this job, yeah
Do you?
I'd rather him not travel it, I'd rather him stop here on Sunday and not come home so that he's got ample rest, cos he's not getting it  I, I, I dunno, I, I might be wrong, but he moans at me cos I knock me
out, he says to me you'll kill yourself, you always want to do something, but to be honest it's worse for me to sit there and watch that, it's more tiring because by the end of the night I'm not tired or I've been asleep all evening I, I'm better to go out, I know it sounds awful but I don't like being trapped, I don't like being in because somebody seems to think I should be in
Yeah
that, and, and, I mean it's probably better for George to do what he wants to do, rather to do what he don't want to do because we used to be in the same predicament when we were doing cabaret, we'd go down to London on the Saturday, we'd leave here what about half three, four o'clock, so if we stayed in digs, we'd be finished work say midnight, we'd be back in digs for one, then he'll go up till seven the next night
yeah, yeah I mean
what do you do I mean, your ok you can go to bed, but there's only a certain amount of hours you can stay in bed cos then you're wondering and wondering and won so you're more tired trying to find something to do so we 
That's right 
we made it straight away, we were working Saturday and Sunday in London as soon as we were finished I always used to make us a pack of sandwiches about six or eight didn't I?
A massive great big flask of coffee and when we got there we stopped and had a sandwich and a coffee, and we'd go in the club, set all up and we'd sit quiet and then we'd have a quiet drink wouldn't we?
As soon as we'd packed all the stuff in the ba van we'd have the rest of the sandwiches the rest of the coffee or another cup of coffee and then we'd get on the road and even if we'd got back for four, by the time we'd got home and, and had something to eat or if we didn't want nothing to eat, watched the telly for half an hour and get to bed, you've got from eleven till sort of three or four the next day which is just nice because you're in your own home
That's right.
But you think it'll kill him from one o'clock in the night till seven o'clock the next morning, it's, it's ridiculous and financially were no different because you've got to pay for digs you've got to pay for the petrol 
That's what he says, that's what he says, but I 
I mean driving isn't, driving is not necessarily
to the right sort of people, you enjoy driving it's a shame you don't drive because then that way you will have your Saturdays free because you could get your shopping done and, and be done.
That's right, yeah.
And then it'll give you the time just to relax together but I mean that, that's why I say, Rudy hasn't got a clue in this
my mum's seventy five, how does she get back er ten pound of potatoes and all the week's shopping, I say well I'll go and then he moans at me cos I'm running around after everybody else but
True
Yeah, but, no, no, it's exactly the same as them he couldn't be bothered, I mean my mum's eighty and, and she can't get out now and he can't
the same you know with me, but I mean end of day you've got it to do
Of course you have.
I mean I've got to look after her
Mm  I get worried sometimes for him.
You see my brother Joe is wrong, he should have, he's a workaholic, and they're doing sixteen hours a day and they're working, can you imagine, and I mean my youngest brother Brad who's working with him said er Joe don't stop, a week, no a fortnight la , a fortnight last Sunday  they had to put a  not air conditioning  yeah it is air conditioning unit in Smith's in Staines and they had to whatever happens they had to get it working for the next day, it's got to be in and working and they worked all day, my brother, my eldest brother Derek weld it for nine hours non stop, to the point where Brad our, my younger brother and Joe had
just working in the same room as him welding all them hours 
You've lost your
you've lost your
The dog has got it
I've lost me
Like erm, like Maureen she's erm  she's worried for Joe, she says he don't stop, he don't, but you see the difference being is it's Joe's business and it's as he said, some people don't pay you for twelve months, and a lot of your money has gone out before you can get a chance to get it back in 
Back in 
I mean they don't put, they don't, I understand in, in, when you've got your own business like Brad and them, well our Joe can't be hard up he does a job and it brings him thirty grand in
Mm
I said yeah, but that thirty grand he's got to 
he's gotta wait for 
he's got to wait for, plus the fact that he's probably spent twenty of it out getting equipment
That's right 
That's right, yeah 
then you know, they don't believe that
I don't know
he said well you know
my boss you see my boss isn't very workaholic at all 
Mm, his boss is the same
he's in there every morning before eight o'clock and he don't leave there much before half past six, sometimes seven o'clock, and then the workers goes in on Saturdays and if he knows there's nothing to do just walk around a crowded place and
but I mean he's a millionaire, and that's how, I mean this is the difference between probably between him and Joe, I mean he don't depend on money to come into this
No
cos there still an
so great in running different
and so on, every month their money is straight into the bank all their cheques come in straight into the bank so he'll, you know, and I mean our pla , and the whole of the site nearly is let out for different people, you know, which is money coming in all the time
Yeah
you see?
Yeah 
But I mean you know he's a workaholic and he expects everybody to be the same and then he works in there by the time I get there in the morning he works, works solidly right through until I leave there at night, you know.
Yeah, but you see then he's at fault  I mean like yesterday he come in he said he's got to drop off at Milton Keynes and he said I, I, he weren't due to be dropped until what half past ten?
Half past ten 
And when he got there the bloke said oh just pull up and go and get it done now, I said now any other man would of gone in the cafe and thought right, I would of been drop now till twelve
That's true.
and he being dropped at sort of nine o'clock
Yeah.
he went straight back to work
Yeah but, yeah but you see 
you see he always makes an excuse but
no it's a, it's, it's, it, it, it is not like that I'm making an excuse, I always think ahead and look ahead right, now I've got a phone in my cab, all the other lorries have, you know, a mobile phone, right, how he know I'm supposed to give the
drop off at half past ten right, that's
yeah
if I finish on road in the
right, they jump in my cab and I decide to drive away and he phones and then he
can you get the so and so erm
driver for me on the phone, so he calls me up, oh we've got load of them he said
 

I get back to the phone many time later you know  see, I can't
be late, because then I would be lying cos I'm just home and I want to get
pick up so and so, so and so, I know, you, I think
drop myself in the
you know
That's right, yeah.
Whereas if I had a, a, a phone in my cab, right and he, and he phone me etcetera etcetera
at night, ok
it will need for him to phone the firm then because he got me direct
That's right yeah, yeah.
But I tell you what you don't get any badges nowadays for being honest, I know that much .
Well, no , I'm afraid not and it's, it's a sad state of affairs, I mean when you see 
Well I see 
of when you've got to be a rotter to get on but I'm afraid that's how it's gonna be 
Well that's all , that's all that it is, it's all the rotten people that are now getting on.
But as I was saying to George the other day 
Or selfish 
and, and, and
you know, he's that sort of bloke, he's a very nice bloke and he's got a heart of gold and he's saved us no end of the money ain't he, since I've been working for him?
He's saved us a lot of money in one way, but he don't pay the wage
This is what I said
I mean
so I suppose one counteracts the other 
Compensates yeah
compensates for the other 
yeah, yeah ,
I mean I know which one I'd rather have
yeah
the
that's right, yeah, that's right, yeah, I mean it's, it's, it's, disgusted when you know a bloke for this firm
and all this money that he's got, can't pay a man a living wage, so  but it's a decent as I say, he's lucky to be got a job these days.
That's true, that's very true 
I mean I know that now because I never thought I'd be on the scrap heap, but sometimes I really do feel as if I am
Yeah
because er, when they say how old are you and you say forty nine, they say oh well we, we, we were really looking for somebody a bit younger
Mm
and you think to yourself how can you, you know, I'm prepared to work cos I'm
I mean she said to me when I went for this Men Mencap job she said erm, have you got any trade behind you?
I said well I can do everything in the hotel trade from housemaid to housekeeper to barmaid, the only thing I haven't done is managed one but I could do that if I had to and I done, done booking of the reception and I've done bar, I've done diner's room, I've done kitchen, I've done
I've done chambermaiding, I've done housekeeping, there ain't many other things you can do  and then she says and what about cooking?
I said well I, I'm a confident cook, I've cooked from meals all round the world you know, and she s and erm, she said oh that's worth knowing, now the
some, some of us can't even boil a bloody egg, I mean it's, it's ridiculous, you think to yourself what's, what's it all about at the end of your at the end of the day
Yeah
so, you've just got to have to, point is I'm not gonna try and get big
going, but I'm, I'm just, I'm trying to think of how I'm gonna get myself motivated again to get back to work
Yeah 
and that's what it is gonna be motivated, but at the end of the day there, the, the people that you work with they ain't worth a
I know that's true 
I'm afraid you have to be like them cos, to survive
yeah 
I mean I don't know about you, but if I, if somebody drops a spoon in the restaurant I can't help but
Pick it up 
pick it up 
that's right, yeah
Most blokes say they don't give a
you know, so what do you do, do you follow your instincts or do you follow the law?
Are we gonna push off?
Yes, dear.
Get me coat
till about nine
Oh well you've still got a chance to go and get her ready duck.
Are they?
You
he weren't gonna miss going out tonight were he?
I think you don't know going one
 

He's staying in.
Look, we'll come up one night, one Friday night 
done this job for a long time won't you?
We'll stop Friday night, one Friday night when you're doing none.
 

Oh, well anyway, well, we gonna Marbella again, how's about that .
I finish , I finish at one o'clock on a Friday
Do you?
I'm back home for half past two
Oh well
We could be up here for er
tea time
Yeah, on Friday what?
Give us a ring when you're not doing nowt 
I think we go up 
Well you give us a ring when you wanna come, I mean
I mean Friday night we don't do much anyway you know, I mean it's like everything else if I don't, if I say to mum, mum we've got nothing to do, I mean it's like everything else you can't afford to go out and do what, things that you would like to do, but you know like bingo and things, so we al , we get a game of cards going just to stop the rot and the boredom
Yeah
We play dominoes more than cards at the minute though
yeah
I mean it's only just to, just to do something otherwise you just sit here and you think it's, you're stuck here from morning till night and all you can do is keep going round, I mean I can keep working here
Oh I, you could always find a job to do can't you?
Oh yeah, oh there's hundred's of jobs want doing round here again, but you do the same ones over and over again and I think to myself what a waste of a day.
Mm
Cos at the end of the day you've worked hard and you ain't earned nothing that day.
Oh yeah, yeah.
So that's what we'll do.
Well you let us know when you want to come down
Yeah.
it's as simple as that  well then we can go out and have a drink with you, weren't fair, we weren't gonna stop this long were we, we just popping in to see
Happy New Year.
It's a long way, it's a long way to come and pop in  see  without you knowing him as well as I do he, he, Rudy's so hard to move, I mean I'd love, I've said that 
Stick a bomb up his backside 
oh , I used to say when, if we were living in England now, we could go Scotland for the weekend, we could go to the Lake District, we could go to the Cheddar Gorges, we do nowt.
We will have to go to the Lake District my darling.
He's just such an old bore.
Because, I only ever so it
See people say to me you've got to do, well you've got to remember one thing Joy, Rudy's older than you and I think to myself well if he don't wanna do it you know that's, that's his problem, so, but
Yeah
I'm not very 
 
They don't find drivers 
 
I have to do blooming miles and miles,
suffer all this sort of thing, you know.
That ain't, that ain't basically it, you don't wanna do it, that is the main thing, I mean you never been one for wanting to go, I mean even when we lived in Jersey and you ain't got any idea how small Jersey is, Val and John used to come to us, but we never went to Val and John's, it's hell all mighty getting him out, if I don't go on me own, I don't go.
Oh, you weren't like that years ago though were you, when he was stopping out at bloody four o'clock in the morning  I come round Joy, I've come round
I know
he'd be here knocking on the door, arrive early
I wouldn't of got to work.
I would never of bloody did that time, every time she says anything is about the sleep night that we had.
I blooming late night 
Mine was the noise
I'd like a double of that.
We used to, we used to, we used to have some lovely card nights, he never plays cards, we, we have a game of Trivial Pursuit when we go to Spain he'll join 
I've got a game 
he'll join in then but he wants to 
I bet you , I'll tell you what I've got a game and I will fetch it down
the one that Sue bought kids for Christmas
oh god you can't buy it, well you can but it's thirty pounds, thirty something pounds to buy.
Dingbats?
No 
Pictionary
no 
no it weren't Pict ,Pict , erm no it's not that.
Cluedo
No it's not that
How do you play it?
Tell me and I'll tell you 
It's a board about as long as that, that's all you've got in it and then there's all these cards and questions and what have you 
And how do you get the questions done, do you write, draw pictures 
It's questions and answers, I don't know, I've forgotten, I, I, I only opened it up and had a look at it at Christmas and I thought thirty something pounds for that, a load of rubbish, I don't know what it is.
Not Dingbats?
No 
No 
Is it
 

Dingbats, I think we've got Dingbats and Pictionary and we've got miniature Trivial Pursuit, you know, the travelling one, where you
Oh I've got the big one of that
Yes, but you, this one you've got some little bits that you spin it round and if it lands on a colour you, it tells you what you've got to, then you've got to put 
No, I got 
and er, Trivial Pursuit.
But you see when we're in Spain we sit rou ,rou of the swimming pool and we play that 
 
and everybody, everybody will hear you know, who was the Prime Minister of India between the year such and such a, and were saying Mahat Ghandi, me hat and me coat
Me hat and me coat me jacket and me hat and me, all sorts
what with me hat and me coat
and er where's me Ghandi and all this and then somebody from the other side of the pool was saying it so and so, so and so, then he said couple of old
you know
, spin it again and you
I forgot, I'll fetch it you down anyway, next time
We've had some real, we've had a real good
So did we
 
We use to dig er , we use to dig er, we use to dig er, dig the old ice box over with the drinks in it, ice with the orange juice, and gin and tonic and all bloody sorts
Home made sangria, we'd leave it in the fridge you see 
Sangria and we'd have it, yeah 
then he comes home, that's what he likes to do potter around the house, well I don't want to potter around the house when I've been stuck in for twelve months.
No  oh we'll have to get motivating him then.
You can't motivate him, I've tried, in the end I just 
Oh, he's got to get motivated cos if we're going away we got to save some pennies up and if we commit ourselves then we've got to save pennies up, it's no good coming and saying to me you're going away next week, I shall turn round and say sod you matey we're not cos we've got no bloody money.
It'll be harder to get to the villa in some respects because Val and John, Val, Val's husband's retiring in July, he suffers with his dreadful headache, and they're going to spend ninety per cent of their time in Spain, but she did say whenever I want to go, as long as I let them know they'll come home cos they're gonna buy a house in Chesterfield and er she said whenever we wanna go, they'll come back over to their house in Chesterfield, so, we
I mean you were, you were
it's just a matter when I get a job, I mean
well that's it.
Alright they don't want to go to Chesterfield then we thought they could come here, look after the house, look after the house the same as we'd look after it, and Val said this
Yeah
as I say Pam and her husband are going back down to villa erm in June  I mean Val wants me and Rudy to go down to the villa, they're going from July to the end of September this, this year, probably for longer, but erm
I made up me mind
holiday, cos I've got four weeks holiday to come now, this year  and that's not, that's not 
I was gonna say, but you see 
counting the Saturdays and Sundays and so on  
its, it's, it's the same Saturdays and Sundays, I can't get him out of the house  and yet soon as we get there we have friends and family and they say, keep saying come on, come up and see us, I went up in the mini on me own one day and spent a couple of days with her, but, it, it ain't the same when you go on your own, I daren't go too far in my mini because it's, it's erm, it's not a car that you can be hundred per cent sure of it, I mean as soon as it rains it stops anyway, we went out in it today and there's all water in the front of the, in the front, but
That's your heater.
And me heater's packed up 
that's the trouble with being out of work, when I'm getting behind with every, by the time I start work we'll probably be wanting new bedding, new towels, the house will want doing
Mm
take me twelve months to get back on me blooming feet.
That's because I
you have not tidy though.
The old 
 
I mean you'll spend just what you wanna spend in Spain, I mean like we, the night, when we went the first time, we took an ice box, but oh, we
take it back, you don't wanna lot of clothes cos
you, you literally need shorts, swimmies, there's all towels and that there in the villa, there's nothing to take in that, in that line only, only 
I say you only have to take something, cardigan
 
it get's, it get's cooler at certain time of day and it heats up again 
Only beach towels, you could, you could take everything in a, in a 
 
So what we done, we took a big bag full of food didn't we, like, every week somebody brings home another tin of ham, a tin of corned beef, tin of beans, or a packet of biscuits and then er, at
 
bacon 
yeah we went and bought a three pound, no a five pound pack of bacon didn't we right, right 
don't need to buy eggs , eggs over there 
we took a dozen with us 
duck eggs 
so that we got, cos say you have a lot of holidays, so that when we get there as I say we ain't gotta go out and shop and get stuff, we've got bacon and egg
Well you just have to
we take some of them part bake breads and some cheese and biscuits and a great big packet of cheese and, and you just you know, you can either just sit there, but the food, once you get down the food is so cheap you don't want nothing else in the heat.
Well that's right you don't, cos I mean you don't eat a lot do you?
You can have a nice cheese in a salad 
Yes, that's right, bread and butter and
eat at night
Yeah
without any cooking.
I mean there's no point in going away to be stuck 
 
in else cooking blooming meals is there?
Oh no
I mean that's how I was, I mean and that's 
And this is what, this is what we like to do you see enjoy yourselves 
That's what we like to do but Pam and them don't like 
We like to go out 
food, they're, they're non food people, they don't wanna go, all they want to do is get something in their stomachs, we don't, when we go oh I like to eat the culture, I like the
 
Yeah 
paella.
We went to this restaurant one night up in the mountain, he was starting to tell you, we walked in and there was all these people about eighteen and twenty sitting in the middle of the room and we went in, and it was late, it must of been eleven and we said you know can we eat and he said yes, yes and after he said, he said
fancy the paella he said no problem I make paella so, I mean all of half an hour went by, but we went in and we had paella and then all these people started dancing, they moved the chairs back and they started clapping and singing and dancing and I said is this 
 
a party and he said no, no, he said it's because it's so hot in the houses, they've come out to eat because it is so hot 
 
in their house, in their home and erm and yet in the end they were, they were coming round they were singing, dancing, clapping and they got all us going as well 
Yeah
and that was the only one night we never took the video camera with us
yeah
we had a fabulous time, didn't we?
yeah
Just off the cuff like that.
Yeah, well I mean it's always the unexpected
Oh yeah
that, that, gives you enjoyment, I mean other than that I mean if it's all pre-planned
oh yeah
you don't enjoy it half as much, I don't think.
Well the thing is
it was like Jersey, we lived there for twenty, twenty years didn't we?
And, and you think to yourself oh we've seen everything, but I used to get pleasure in taking somebody to the potteries because I knew they hadn't seen it and it would be like ooh, when they got there, you could see the shock, the surprise in their eyes when they went in there 
When we went to er when we went to Austria, not Austria the year before we had a trip out to the that er big factory at that er crystal factory
Oh yeah
and that
I've forgotten what you call it  oh the stuff in there were oh, but you couldn't afford to buy it
What
 
No 
You know you can buy them in, in London, four pound they were
Oh they were a lot more than that weren't it?
We bought these, we bought , we bought these up the road er, they've got a big er ceramic place there, any imaginary thing at all you won't

and this big, yeah 
Whereabouts understand the
They're nine, nine hundred and fifty pesetas each that's
Which is four pound
well thousand of francs is a fiver 
just half of that is a fiver 
And then like the smaller ones although they, they twenty five 
Yeah, but it's still a 
you see, I, I wove the basket
and that little basket on there
I, I and I sew this 
they're Spanish
They're Spanish, oh I've been admiring that tonight 
and 
I bought it only cost be about what, I think we said er, what less than a pound each, them two ash trays
and er I saw them on a rack and they were 
 
Georgey did you see the

Well what was the first one we made?
Jug and jug and
cups, and all to go, to go with it
Oh they're nice

The sangria jug and then there's six sangria cups to go with it.
Sangria you have all fruit in it you know.

Oh no I didn't like that
well that was what
Yeah, but there weren't, there weren't drinking 
 
yeah
our Brian and he went down and got him
But you see there's a lot, there's so many different ways of making sangria, I mean you can make it real rough like just cheap wine, what it should be, cheap wine, sugar and, and fruit, I don't when I make it I put rum or whisky liqueurs 
 
sugar and erm Tia er not Tia Maria, creme d' banana or something like that, yeah and erm plenty of ice cubes 
Plenty of ice, yeah 
and leave it and then er it's, it's the fruit that makes you silly.

The ones that I, I enjoyed and then there were ones that he had oh that were horrible, it was vile, yuck  I didn't like that.
I made one out of a pale wine a ros wine as well, the girls don't like the red wine, but they like the ros wine
I don't like red wine 
see you like the ros then do you?
but that really .
 
You see in Spain you buy packets of wine, they're like 
Yeah 
thirty pence a packet for a pint, so you buy six of them 
Oh it's cheap innit?
Oh yeah 
Oh yeah that's why, that's why it's Spanish cos it was, the fruit is cheap the wine is cheap
That's right
and that's why they make it, it's only punch after all innit?
Yeah
When we go down to the market and erm, what they call it 
 Porta Man Curit I mean  Bwangdirola 
 Bwangdirola you go round there, right
You get a kilo of cherries for sixty P 
One, the one section, one section of it, it's all women clothes and lace ware and beautiful clothes and so on, you know it's a market but you know and little places of pottery and so on and then the next section you go down this old market, there's a old big square and you walk on there and you're talking about, you go to buy avocados over here , you're buying sixty and seventy pence for one, and you're paying sixty pence for about bloody six over there 
For a kilo

Oh no
you know, and they were, as soon as we got out it was let's have dinner quick

Mm
everything's closed up, I love to walk in the nude
well at night when we've come back from wherever we've been with Wendy, it was a ritual to walk round, cos on the, on the
where the villa is there's the most beautiful restaurant you've ever seen
Oh don't get me wrong I don't like doing this every night.

Their son had his Sierra broken into and erm  er  a good thing, no were not actually there.
Got it back, there was erm a blanket in the boot and when they took the blanket out it was all ten thousand pounds worth of drugs and needles and everything in it, so the police have took it all back and they've written it off, so they've got a new Nissan, a Bluebird
Yeah, it's fabulous
so erm, as I say but 
But you see the parts of these cars now, right, like erm, what you say Nissan and blooming Toyota's and so on, right, they've got their factories open here
Yeah
if you went to Burton-On-Trent I think it's Toyota, you ought to see the size of that blooming place, er it's right huge where they're manufacturing cars, eventually, well probably now parts of these are, are, are going to be cheaper.
They're going to be cheaper for the English market but they'll have to put on their prices for the export market for those that are going out
yeah
the company expect this
yeah
but don't these Japanese factories who their idea now are, are they about to tend
Ford's are blooming, all these people are
are gonna start suffering
Well Vauxhall are suffering already aren't they?
Because they're too , because they're too blooming expensive 
yeah 
Jill was saying they made another twelve redundant at Creda  Graham's jobs changing all over when they go back at Easter

Yeah and that's another thing I found I had a letter from the Social Security saying would you please send your order book back you're not entitled to any more money, your sickness benefit's run out, I thought it can't have, I don't go back until the twenty fifth of March, phones up for the appointment I got it on the fifth of March, nine days ago
Oh

Does she not find
no
what she say, is she well enough
not well enough to do that, so I'm not looking for a job yet, she said your nerves are all
she, keeps checking me for the thyroid as well now, every time I go  and the tablets are all going haywire, she takes a blood test, a blood thing you know, your pulse every time I go
 

Well at least you know what is responsible for half of the things that have gone out
yeah
but, it quite such a burden is it?
no.
See what he's doing with his fur, look  scratching and it's going off and, he knocks his fur off and then it falls, falls out  look at him the
Yeah probably, if er
Yeah probably he has to scratch
wouldn't make that if you
it's cos he went up mum's the other day and they've all got it but I don't like 
yeah but if they get 
it in the fur though
get him a flea collar
The trouble is, if you put, I bought him one, but it knots all his fur up
well
and it's a hell of a job getting them knots out of his fur, it's a real problem 
Benji
he knows
he knows his name, you ain't been walkies today have you?
He did have one today all morning
came down, I think he came down and all of a sudden 
blop, he was back with him, he stays out there all the time when
come down.
He likes his

with old age, he wants to go for a walk  you've been walkies today?
He's so soft
Have you, have you been in your garage yet with sold on, what you can sell and what you can't sell?
Oh well you

because I say if he's got a key and he can get in
Well he's got a key
yeah
and he bought a key
oh
but the policeman said there's, there's no way he can just walk up there and come in the house
Yeah but who is to say he won't if he's go to 
Yeah he's got a key 
Well I don't, I don't have to give him a key as long as I let him in, you don't have to have a key, but he can arrange, he can arrange for me to be there 
to be there 
and the police said all I have to do is phone the police and say well he wants to come and look round the property can I have a policeman there cos I don't want 
so he's not allowed to take anything out 
yes , no
well if I were you I would start sorting out if there's anything good in there that you can make a few bob out of 
mm
you can sort it out 
Sell the 
yeah
you sort it out and 
That's what we said yesterday you should have sold that car
Yeah
although the cops 
I tell you what 
said if I would have sold that car next to nothing I would have been done for it
Was it?
yeah, it went for, four.
how much did he sold it for do you know?
Don't know , no 
But your solicitor will sort that
yeah
you, if there's any money to come back on that
he said that will all look bad on him he said if he sold it and er don't I, he, he said he's got two choices, he either sells that car and pays off the loan in both your names or he, he sells that car and gives you half 
half 
and he said and if he sells the car and keeps all the money and spends it on himself he says that's gonna look, he's gonna look really bad
oh yeah 
but you know what he was taking out of his bank that's what he
to do with
yeah
 

and that's what he
they'll get into the, they'll get into that garage right, so they look and see things they didn't know that they can make money on 
Well there's, there's erm , there's er erm hydraulic jack in there with all the bits, brand new that's in there 
Tell you what if they've got a hydraulic jack in there, several people have to buy it off him, the boys will buy it off 
 
there's , there's a, a small jack red or about as big as that like that 
What, the jack?
and it's got three ton
Three ton?
Yeah, that's there
There, I'll tell you what, the garage, were always looking for blooming things like that, that's what they want to
Oh I, I know that this, this little jack takes more weight than the hydraulic one  and he's meter in there ain't there?
That, that real nice electrical meter
what they call them, erm
What like Daph's?
yeah, I ain't
after that you want to put all your, wanna put it in a box of, and see what you
selling and then if there's anything that's
then you won't
I don't know what he took, no one here, full stop, they can't say well he can't say well I left it here either and he's got any proof
no
you sell them it and make yourself a
 
there's some very there's some odd, odd tools up there
yeah
Pete also said you'd, you'd be best to keep your drill, your electric drill
drill, cos you never know when you're gonna need a drill, then I'll show you how to use that 
yeah, yeah
I've got bloody drills here and all sorts you don't want a
 

Yeah make yourself some money, Kev was looking for a drill, but the trouble is you  you don't get your money off Kev will you?
Mm
I don't know what else is up there
Er you want to let him have a look 
yeah 
take him over Pete , Pete 
 

Have you got your money off Rachael yet?
No, I've sent her book back, I've got her book it's going back
Why?
They've altered all the money again haven't they?
I had, I had a letter, I had two letters one for her and one for me saying would you please send your book back for her and mine send your book back cos I ain't qualified for
unless I phone them up tomorrow and say look, you know, I, she, if she keeping on the club she'll go backdate it
Will she?
Yeah, all I've got to do then is send, send it in and I'll phone them and say well can I cash it up and still on the club and they'll say yes  but I'll have to get up and get round there tomorrow then 
She's good though she's kept
mm
she said she would didn't she?
yeah  I don't know where it's all coming through now I tell you
I said to that bloke today well how, how long am I gonna be before I go to court, he said it could be two years away
Did he?
Yeah
Well that's ridiculous
he said well it all, it all depends how quick you want a divorce 
What have they said about your divorce then?
Nothing
You've not heard nothing about it?
No
I can't understand it, what if some people with families been evicted or chucked out or whatever?
Seems strange don't it?
Mm  Oh I've put in for one to pay the erm interest on the mortgage, which I have to do and that's all being seen to because I've had another letter saying can you tell me what this second loan were for and I've put down yes, it was for windows and sent a bit of paper er, you know, that we've paid four thousand seven hundred and something, five thousand, nine hundred and something we've paid for them windows and I've spent that 
They get 
paper first before you sending them money
No, but I've asked for them to be returned, it's only gone to the D H S S in Wellingborough 
Your aren't half losing weight though  still you ain't getting your down periods now are you?
No, I only had one 
Coping with 
this morning
You did?
Mm
What over that?
Yeah
Yeah, but, I think that was more shock than anything
Yeah
Oh that reminds me as well what your
how you getting on better down, you know, your poll tax business, are you getting any relief on the cheaper unit?
Course I'm not 
You're not?
Of course I'm not because you're at work 
Oh there's
I can't understand that either, they ain't getting no relief off of their poll tax and yet they're, yet she's not at work and he's on the dole, and they still having to pay full whack.
I says to them 
Is that true?
that's not right, I said you get, you get twenty per cent reduction off
Yeah
they'll get sixty percent
sixty percent, I'm expecting a bailiff at my door any day 
If, if, if, if it's, if it's, if it's, if it's two of you living in the house right  the poll tax isn't paid by one person, it's each person is, is responsible for their own poll tax
No they're not
No, if one's not working and the other one's working, the one that isn't working's supposed to get relief on it
No, you're wrong, you're wrong, you're totally wrong dear, because as long as one's at work 
As long as one's at work 
you're responsible for mine and if I'm at work I'm responsible for yours, I wrote to the D H S S
Mm
I had a paper to say and they said there was too much money coming in here a week, because you were working that I couldn't get anything and I, it said, I wrote, it, it all come when I wrote to say could I have relief off of prescriptions cos I was on that H I V at the time
Yeah
and they said no, I weren't entitled to it
No
I'm not entitled to, if I'm, I'm entitled to pay up to eighty pounds on a maximum dentist treatment, which is a hundred and thirty pound
A hundred and fifty pound.
I could pay, I would have to pay the first eighty somewhat and I would have to pay the first ninety, ninety somewhat on a pair of glasses 
I had all this then it went and then it went into 
If I if you've got people in prison and then you had to go visiting you, you could get relief after, after the first twenty five pounds, so if the expenses were going to see somebody in prison were more than twenty five pounds I could get relief with them 
Er how could I, I mean, is there a
I mean there's so much of money coming in the house every week
I'll kill him, they don't worry, they don't worry about what, what bills you've got going out, I E a car on H P or your or erm furniture on H P, when you're on on the dole you're you ain't supposed to have had any bills incurred
whether you still pay them tax wise they now I've still got my redundancy money I weren't thirty days without it, or I'll 
Yes, but this is not, yeah 
save mine up
this is not a
this is er, this is er, erm, how do they call it?
I think it's imposed by, by the laws of England
Mm
right, this whole tax business, this is not a thing when you incur the
they've stuck on you, right  so I mean alright, I'm paying, I'm paying my food
if you work it out this year, right, Joy keeping her dole right, this one, say
having this whole thing out, right, she'd pay right, I bring home wage, right believe it or not I'll tell you it's about between a hundred and eleven and a hundred and fourteen pounds a week, that's forty and ten, that's a hundred and fifty pounds a week, right, now if she got to pay poll tax out of that, right, what she's getting which is twenty odd pounds a month
Mm
I've got to take twenty odd pounds a month, right 
and forty 
that's forty 
that's fifty pounds innit for a month, so that's a month
No that's a month so it's fiver a week
Yeah
fiver a week
yeah
plus your rent
yeah, plus your rent
plus your gas and your electric and your living
yeah
you know, you ain't got nothing to live on at the end of the 
No you've not 
so this is what I'm saying how come that the she's still got the poll, we have to, got to pay poll tax at that rate because she's not working
Mm, they told me though that there's too much money coming in the house, you, you, you're only allowed to have I think it's about sixty something 
Yeah 
pounds from
to get any relief if any of it's 
 
well I know when, I know when Alan and Jade were both made emplo , unemployed and Alan  withdrawal his dole and when Jade was unemployed they took the dole off Alan and give him sixty pound a week which was you know
Income support 
income support  so 
 
the dole 
I had, I had a letter the other day saying that I'd been paying thirty nine pounds, fifty a week to live on, but I've been entitled to fifty five pound something for low income support so are they gonna backdate all that and then get their
I reckon they'll have to, yeah they will have to surely, that's their error  they'll have to
They said a, a normal person living on their own is only entitled to thirty nine pound sixty a week and that's what I've got in that book, but I don't think they realise that I I'm on me own and I've got a gas, electricity and everything else to pay out of that 
I don't know how, I, I as I say I can't figure it out how they work it out though because I mean are they 
 
I don't know whether they 
 
I was so annoyed I thought to myself
If you go down Citizen's Advice it's all done, on a big, on a big board down there what you're entitled to 
You would have been , you, you, you would have been better off paying your normal rates as you used to pay
Yeah, yeah
than in actual fact because they're making a
 
that's what Kevin and Cindy said their rates on that house were a hundred and something pound a year, their poll tax is nearly four hundred 
Four hundred 
they're paying three hundred and eighty pounds, they're paying
Yeah, they're better off paying the normal rates 
said it's ridiculous 
and they've stopped this on you and they expect you to pay all this amount of money I don't know
Yes, we did have some good news about that court case, about that accident we had, it's all been thrown out of court
What car accident?
You know we had an accident along where we opened that car door and that cyclist
Oh yeah 
hit us in the side?
Well they got to court without a solicitor cos they weren't entitled to Legal Aid, and now you see that's another thing, they're both out of work, they weren't entitled to any Legal Aid, so they had to go on their own to court
Yeah
and explain the situation and the court said oh well we'll take it to the magistrate's then, then he had a letter two weeks later saying that it's been thrown out again, they haven't got a case cos she were in the wrong, she's never, ever have gone 
 
over round the left hand side in the first place, but she must have been in the wrong so they must have seen it as well, they haven't really got a strong case so they threw it out of court and last week he had a letter, he opened it, from the, from the court, and he thought oh gawld here we go again, he's got jury service, oh 
How old is he?
Oh right, I'd love to do that
So would I, it's in April
I'd love to sit in
it said if you are on the dole or unemployed or whatever you must take this form down, because he's entitled to
So, so, so much per day
Yeah
or whatever it is, yeah
yeah, yeah, for, for, for fee, for a, for a meal
yeah
I don't know why, if he gets put on a murder case he's there for three weeks in a hotel, it's easy he said well I, you'll be able to come over if you want to it'll be like sitting at work, no one will know 
 
It might be, I think in actual fact during your er, I think it might be a waste of time, but I think it's probably advisable to try and find out a bit more about this
I've been darling, I, believe me I've, you ain't gotta do it
Well I've got to go down tomorrow, I ain't got a clue what to do.
I rang, I rang, I went to the dole office, when I went down I ask them as soon as I left Ann  said the same, go down the dole when you ask about your poll tax, they said to me we can't give you any id , er anything, you have to phone them, council building site, I phone the council building and they asked me, that's why I sent all your wage slips in for
Yeah
and that was for that, then I had a letter back to say that we were having, there was too much money coming in a week for me to draw unemployment and then they, then a few days later I had this double page letter a big one that says you are entitled to no prescription help, X amount of pounds after erm eighty pounds per glasses you are responsible for the first eighty pound, we say that you can afford to pay that, so much on your teeth, if you're visiting somebody in prison then you exceed a certain amount of mileage you can only get it if you exceed more than twenty five pound incurring, then I thought oh blow it, forget it, and I never done it, that all come to then, that's why I wanted a ten of your wage, wage slips  you remember now?
That's it.
Yeah, a hundred and eleven pound a week
Oh say, say about my fault, I shouldn't want to pay 
I, I tell you what 
I've got more money, I've got more money than that and after I've been, after, after I've paid, after I've paid the tax 
and I'm not, I'm not paying mine before October cos as far as I'm concerned it was paid, he has my wages 
out of that and my National Insurance contributions, that's all I come out with
Mm
So like I even said that to the coppers today I said he's been handling seventeen hundred pounds near enough near as damn it 
That's right 
a month, I've been here none, my poll tax weren't paid, my mortgage owed three months, what's it, been three months in arrear
Of course your wages were six hundred and something
Yeah and he were coming out with eleven 
eleven hundred, eleven 
eleven hundred, yeah, yeah 
eleven hundred and sixty , seventy and you had
a bit more 
nearly, nearly, nearly seven hundred pounds a month 
a month 
and he had over a thousand, one hundred a month
Yeah
nearly eighteen hundred pounds a month
Did he now?
and yet the mortgage was three months in arrears, no poll tax paid, no other bills paid, all he's paying is the gas, electric and the water rates 
 
I just don't see how they can waste that money, but there you are, I said that one day, I, I put down that fact today 
well I couldn't believe it when we went to Jersey and he was out of money and I couldn't believe it he ain't got any money
and you were 
well he 
eight hund , how much he owed eight hundred pounds
No five hundred quid
overdrawn?
Well he, he's on himself hanging over his car because he said it's, it's, that it was an inconvenience cos they were late for work, he suppose to be getting a taxi into work every day and back, but where's his proof that he did?
He declared
He's declaring that he's using a taxi and it costs him a hundred and sixty pound a month, every day back and forwards to work, well everyone knows that's a lie cos she takes him to work
You ought to shop him for the income tax then
I'm gonna 
As I say he's getting away 
Last word will be
I said oh well, what
I said to him well where the receipts to prove this paying this taxi, right
I ain't got that, nothing
well which, or which taxi firm you've been using
mm
and they get
for the taxi books as well 
mm
because I'll tell you what when they send a probe in, they go through every blooming thing with a fine tooth comb
You can't believe where they know all what they know from
er
you didn't, it, it 
That Colin's come up today and he said, he said, did, erm, Dick  do the job for you?
I says what job?
Yeah 
He says on the car, I says it's nothing to do with you and Chris, he said what about you trying to, you were going to break into his flat then and erm set light to it, where'd they get my
information from?
You see, I mean, what happens is erm
I don't know
If, if, if, if Jersey right where I used to have the, Joy used to have the house
because this is once a year, there's not
right  they knew exactly how much money I was banking, how much money was going into the bank, I
they always say, they always turn round and say well the bank is not su supp supposed to divulge how much money you've got in the bank now, now how did they have any
ah?
I don't know if they do the same over here 
Yeah
where the bank is not suppose to disclose how much money you've got in that
income tax man had go
that copper man had told me this morning
because you're suppose to declare what you earn 
What you earn, yeah 
for a year and pay the tax out of that
yeah 
right
mm
but how did they 
 
they'll get, they'll get you 
When they start probing you, they go right back and I mean they went back what ten, twelve years didn't they?
About twelve years when I was in Jersey
Yeah  yes
It's frightening what they did to us.
Well he said to Dave that a policeman hasn't got the clout to phone up the erm  driving place you know in London where, where you thought that, what's it called D L V C
It's the
yeah, to see if that car's been sold, stolen or whatever and yet a solicitor come  he said your solicitor will be able to pick up the phone, take you through the right channels, see if he's sold that car, he hasn't sold the car, who's he sold it to 
 
yeah, everything.
He said that's what you've got to do first thing Monday morning, find out where that car is, he said, and then you want half the money 
seemed that the police and we've got a
in theft and fraud and 
yeah 
things like this, but regards to the fact that when, when something is sold to somebody right, erm, and then a, and, and the person who's selling it receives the money, I mean the person the police can't do nothing at all about it unless fraud comes into it
I mean, he, he said about
come up mum's with the, and he snatched my handbag and he took the keys, he said that copper has got no rights to tell him to hand over them keys to me, I said what and he snatched them out of my handbag and I've got no rights to my own house keys and I said what rights have I got to do, down his flat and collect half of my stuff back then?
Yes
He said you've got no rights at all, I said so what rights has he got to coming in my own home then, he ain't paying for it, what rights has he got to it?
What he say?
He said well he's got rights because he owns half of it, I said owns half of it but he ain't paying for half of it.
That's right
He says no, but he, he, he still half owns it, he says his name's on the lease, I said but it still don't make it right that if he, if he earned half of it then half the bills are his 
Half the bills, that's right 
 
Then you've got to pay half the bills
Yeah  I said well I earn half of it as well then and I've worked for half of it, but I ain't paying the bills either 
Seems, it all seems strange to me
He said it'll all come out in court, he said he, he won't get away with it
Who said that?
Oh that copper, he said he, he said the thing is he said what you've gotta do is give him as much shit and aggravation as you can possibly give him, keep him hot and keep him roasted up he said because what happens is he's getting along, long and he's thinking oh I can do this and I can do that and I can do the other, he said but if you can get your solicitor to keep him on his toes he ain't got time to think about nothing, he said and if he has done that job himself, he's laughing at the moment, I said well he must have done it 
I think that, I think in actual fact, that the only thing really to do is if  he doesn't want to be himself do something else and then he won't do it ever again 
And then he should sign it all over to me 
He should sign it all over to you and say alright I'm relinquishing all responsibility
But he can't do that, until he's paid up every penny he owes
I was gonna say
Yeah
if she, if she gets it all signed over to her she signs all the bills over 
but you see 
yeah well then
he can't do that anyway, for him, for him to sign them deeds
no
and everything over to me, he's got to be paid all the loans completely off plus the mortgage that's in arrear, that, that house got to be round to square one with a, with a fourteen thousand pound mortgage and that's it before he can sign that house over to me
Yeah
That means that the two loans that he had, he can't sign them over to me
And that was on the house?
Yeah
Oh well
he can't sign it over 
No he can't 
to me even if he wanted to
I didn't know whether he had two loans or not or whatever it is because 
 
Yeah he had two 
 
that if had relinquished all his responsibility regarding the mortgage and so on and signed it over to you, then you could have turned round and say alright that's it, I'm going to sell the house
That's right and there's nothing he could do nothing about 
and if the house was , and if the house is, if say for argument sake that the house after  you've sold it, you've only your, er fourteen or sixteen thousand pounds to pay then and you've paid that off, right, and the house was sold for about forty thousand
Mm
right, you've made yourself a, your, twenty thousand anyway, then you could probably buy a, a nice little two bedroom bungalow 
Yeah 
for about thirty thousand or something like that and then go back to work and just pay your own mortgage off
Yeah, but I can't do that
but a, as I say if it's, you know, if he gotta pay off all this money first well
Well you're such
at the minute cos you've got, you're sitting in your house
Yes
you're in care of bills that he's, he's responsible for anyway
mm
he's gotta be, you wanna make sure that that electric bill
 
I'm going back down, I'm going down there Monday
Good
 
say I give you no authorization 
I'll fight 
I don't want mail coming to my house addressed to me, my husband is still in charge of these bills, but you don't change it over, I shan't open them I shall just return them back to you, frighten them.
I mean that's like they went into Nigel's and put that erm
Well that's that's why the gas, gas and electric 
leaflet 
men come up with them
for me to sign, I said I'm sorry I'm not signing them and I wouldn't sign any of them and he went back and he said alright then we'll leave it in your husband's name, I said yes you'd better had cos he still owns the house, yet all those bills have come through, I've had water rates come through in my name, I've had the electricity come through it's in my name, the only one bill that was never in his name, never has been is the telephone and that's included 
But I say that, they've got no right to just change your, your name over, I mean, basically, really and truthfully when we got this place Rudy weren't on, on, he never signed on on nothing
No
when this place come it should have been in my name weren't it, because he never done nothing for it
no
Yes,
no
he were never even on the bills, on the papers
no 
where you?
No
Never even knew I was the one 
 
but all the things , everything that comes now comes to Mr and Mrs , you know?
Yeah, that's right 
Yeah
the only thing that doesn't is my telephone bill, it comes sort of under I F, which is if
Which is if I'm a
Yeah  but erm, I, I can't understand why because when I put in for the my, my house I didn't put him, he weren't even on the pap paperwork and all of a sudden he, he
They only
had half my name as well 
he was pulled in, I mean
I went, I went all out to get this place in nineteen eighty three
It seemed that
he didn't know nothing about it
what, you see, what, what happens you see, I mean  all my re all the transactions here are done through banker's orders you see  and the banker's orders they, they won't know who, who ever it is going to be responsible you know, but you've got to put down the wife and, and yourself, see
Mm
but this is where, where it goes back to the, to the house
yeah
as Mr and Mrs you see?
yeah.
Yeah, but you see that's why when Tracy come to me saying she wanted to, to exchange her council house I was annoyed because I said no, I got that council house for Tracy it's in her name
Mm
Yeah
if she relinquished that name and puts it in, in
name 
name yes
and anything breaks up, Tracy's lost her home, she'll never get another one
No
I fought for them two, to get that home for her, so I said no, the only way you'll do it, and I, when she were on her own, I said, not that I don't trust Nigel, I do, but you don't know what's gonna happen in ten, in ten years time, I said I fought for that house for you, if you exchange it, you exchange it in your name
Yeah
Well she come up the other day, they wanted to exchange Kelly's old house for, for, for her, somebody wants it er part exchange Kelly's house, you know then go and
Mm
I said, she said it's got an extra bedroom, Okay I can see that she's got an extra bedroom and they can perhaps do with one now that they got a boy, but, I said, you know, don't, what have you got what you've got, you know at the minute
Yeah
she said she's had all her own central heating
Yeah
done all her double glazing
Yeah
all her kitchen, all her new bathroom
Yeah
what you moving out for?
In another twelve month's time 
Yeah, I mean the boy gets, the boy gets as the boy gets older obviously the council will look into it because you can't have a wife sleeping in the same room 
Two boys 
That's right 
as a boy, therefore why don't they
but as I say that's, that's the only thing, but then on the other hand they can't fall out with me will they?
No
Before I lose that home I've got, I'm
I know, I know 
so
bloody stupid, look at him
Well I shall hand it back, if I'm a single person, I'm entitled to one of them single people's bus then aren't I?
Yeah  but as I say it's the same as when you know we come over when we went up to the
the place, I mean, the chap down at the housing down there, try to say to me we made ourselves homeless
Yeah
I said how can you make yourself homeless if you've been evicted?
that's right
You have made yourself 
but you see they do ,
You were evicted from a country weren't you?
From another country 
you, you, you, you get, do you we've never owed rent 
but that weren't no fault of your own
we never owed any rent, that was done through banker's order as well 
Yeah
to, to
yeah but you see 
I would like to say 
they didn't understand the cultures of another country and how it works 
 
and it was as simple as that, it was only until that I got all the paperwork from Germany that the letters and one thing and another, but somebody in there said to them well you're talking rubbish cos the girl's telling you the truth 
The truth 
Mm, mm
and then and then Miss  said you'd better come down and we'll have a talk about it, I've learnt a bit more about your ex country
Yeah
So, then, then we got into it he said I'm sorry I thought you made yourselves homeless, cos you just wanted to come home, I said no, way, I said we didn't even want to come home, I said we were very professional people 
 
Yeah
at the time, I said we were, I was doing sixty hours a week in me car, we were doing six nights a week cabaret and he was driving all day
Yeah
but I said why come home and miss a season like that in the middle of August?
I said I didn't make myself homeless and he said no I didn't realise by November we, well we went down, that was the September and by the October we got our home didn't we?
Yes
And we got, he got stuck into it, but, that's, that's how people, if you don't get somebody who's working for you, you'll get somebody working against you, and that's what I had, a good solicitor with you at the moment is, gotta be vital, I only hope she's doing her job
So do I  oh I'd better go, thanks for a lovely dinner
So what's Adrian gonna do now?
Dunno, oh he's, he's what, he's been for another job interview and the bloke 
 
Has he left that job?
Yeah, the bloke in
he's gonna let him know tomorrow
I thought he was saying, I thought he said he was gonna stay in that job
He got the sack
He got the sack, cos he got up and left his job  overslept and annoyed erm Rachael because she woke him up twice and said come on you've got to go to work, he said alright then, she, she went back to bed thinking he'd get up and of course he were still laying in bed, I woke him up at five to eleven, said come on you're an hour late, but when he got down there they said no it's no good you've got the sack, and he said well it's your own fault then cos you were woke up twice by Rachael at nine o'clock, he hadn't, he could have got up and gone to work, just idle  we met him twice, it really upset him
Did it?
Yeah, cos he's lost all his college as well ain't he?
Is he?
Oh yeah
Yeah, yeah
Will he be back into
Well he wants to, but I said you'll, you'll got a, you'll it's a long ladder to climb now and you'll never get another job like that
Well he won't get a reference
No I said he won't 
He won't get a reference 
see for reliability
No
He'd have been better off to of crawled back down there and apologise
Yeah
and said well I'll do an extra shift, I'll do an extra week shift if you give me my job back  it's a shame
Mm  that's what that girl's just said to me you get a lot of erm, she said he'll know it's hard and I was saying that you know I, I put all me eggs in one basket with that, I mean that really knocked me for six
I've gone down hill since then, but she said you know these folks are hard when you've been out of work for a long while, you've gotta just get back up and fight again, I said, she said and I know how hard that is, but she said you know, if you can get it going and fit and get in, so
Why she saying this?
she's just giving, she's just give me an adult education centre there at Spinny Hill, Northampton and she said they put everything in perspective for you so that you know where you've got to start, what is available to you and then she said if you go down the job centre and ask them if E T, education, employment training
Mm
so they,
just
so they just call it E T, she said they can actually send you to a place where you can get you, your experience and er because they've sent you, you get an extra certain amount, ten pound a week, cos you're going through the job centre
Mm
but you got to have been out of work six months, so I said well I've been out of work six months, so she, I've got that to do tomorrow, so I get up the firm this Spinny Hill, Northampton, that's an adult education centre where you can go and learn the skills of your trade, but she said that might not start until September
Mm
on the course you see?
Yeah
But if, with this job one, they could, they could say right well we'll put you in a mental home where you will learn your skills, but you will only get ten pound a week
Yeah,
I don't care about that, but at least I'm making a move 
at least you're getting a bit of experience aren't you?
We're getting somewhere
making a move
Yeah
and by the end of that it'll be, make me mind up whether it's what I want

But I saw, I went into town yesterday, haven't been into town and I saw er, I'm just going up past the job centre I had to go to council about me money and I thought well I suppose I ought to make an effort and look in the job centre cos I, I ain't done because I've been in catering all the while
Yeah
and I'm, I'm brassed off with him and I thought I'd know that mug face, it's Maureen
What in the job centre?
I'm dying to stand behind Geraldine in the dole queue 
and I said no waste your bloody time applying cos you won't bloody get it anyway
She said hello she said how's your dad?
I said oh I'm afraid he died, he was cremated on Friday, she said ooh I am sorry

she said that she'd seen Julie and Julie 
Oh yes

No, I mean it's, it's nothing, I rang erm Social Services this morning in Northampton and I got an appointment for an advisory thing on Thursday morning, erm, the women I'm going to see she retires on Friday, she said well I'll have to get you in quick, erm and she, they advise you on the, what you've got to do to get into what I want to get into you see, so erm I've got that to sort to do, I mean
Well that's what you really want though innit?
I really disa 
Is she alright there, sure?
I was really disappointed cos erm I didn't get that one from Mencap cos that was in Rushden
Yeah, because that would've been ideal.
Mm, I thought I'd get it, I really did think I'd get it and I went down with a bump when I didn't
Did you?
Yeah, it knocked me for six
hang on, hang on, I said look
she said who, I said Joy, she said oh blimey is she, I said yeah, so he hung on a bit but he'd
cos there's nobody there today
I could've come earlier cos I've been over Tracey's since quarter past one, as I was coming out the Jehovah Witnesses were coming out
Oh where they?
and erm, I always have them in and have a chat, you know, I don't 
Yeah , yeah well that's what Pauline does sometimes when I go up she has them in for friendship, a bit of company innit?
That's right, I just, I always say to them you're welcome to come in and have a coffee you know, I don't really, I've got me own views, I'm not really interested in what you've got to tell me, I know all about it, but you know you're welcome to come in 
Come in that's right
and they come in and have a coffee, that's it, good boy, and erm, er, so, I, I said well I'm gonna have to go I'm going over to me daughter's she's just had a baby so
So what did she have?
Another, she had a little boy
Oh
Yeah

Tyler she's named him
Oh, she alright?

Is he?
Yeah, he's got so much about him 
 
leave her alone now?
Who?
That bloke
Oh yes, yes, oh yes
yeah
rubbish, oh we have
Last time I spoke to
they, two days before I'd left,
me, me, me, me, me all the while they would not shut their
over there anyway, cos I'm doing the work for
and I wrote it all down, couple of days
Oh, yeah we had another trauma
erm,
Have you had enough to eat?
Eh?
Yeah I'm fine, you know this erm, you know this young girl that was killed along Benji Avenue with her mother?
Well I thought it was Wendy's daughter
Did they?
Half past eleven at night they went and knocked Wendy's door and says can you give me some photos of your daughter and there were two girls and they thought that they were the only two and the woman said that the only two girls I know that are alike them, their age group, erm, er are Nicholas  daughter and erm, and erm her friend
Oh my god,
and erm
strange, having a look round
and er, anyway, they had to get photos and they said well we don't think this is her, but we'll come back
Oh
but, then the next morning of course when Wendy got home she'd been down my nephew's looking after the kids for them and erm, and said we've come to arrest you, and no, oh Rachael said oh mum there's a police car pulled up outside, so she said, oh my god don't tell me they're wrong and it is Tracey, cos Tracey's left home, she's gone to live with her friend and erm, anyway, when Wendy got to the stairs she couldn't go in, she couldn't go any further and she said erm, when, when the policeman said Mrs  I've come to arrest you, she just about said Christ she said what have I done?
They said well your husband's car's been vandalised and they think it's you that's done it so we've come to arrest you   so she said oh I thought you've come to tell me it were me daughter that was dead and he said, he said what you talking about?
She said well the police were here after eleven last night, that young girl that was killed on Benji Avenue they thought it was my daughter, they've got all the photos 
Oh it's terrible 
and he just said oh I'm so sorry he said I wouldn't have come if I had known, but there was a massive wreath in the garden where that girl was knocked over 
Yeah, I can see it 
Yeah, she said 
It was 
Is she, she getting worse?
Brain damage ain't she?
Cos of
 
they left three children in the house
Yeah, that's what Alan said they were away weren't they, she'd only gone to walk the dog
That's right, yeah
Ain't it a shame?
I know its dreadful 
Never know what's gonna happen those bleeding idiots 
Two young boys 
Yeah
er chasing in a X R X you know 
Scott you know he's a swine now Scott
Is he?
From a
I think his mother don't bloody want him, he's a pain in the arse, but she said, I reckon she said piss off and
and he really is immature now
Yeah
said he was running round to see his dad and he's got a car now, he passed his test, he's got a little Renault and he's as stupid as a
and he comes out from
at two o'clock on Saturdays and whizzes round the town doing wheelies round the town  so I said to him last night Scott sit down I want you to read something, I said take a good look at the paper, I said it could've been you, doing that, you think you're so fucking clever and big running round the town, I said it only takes you to lose control go up the bloody curb and bang, that's what happened, I said think about what the hell you're doing
Mm
said it's just one big joke it didn't go in
Yeah
and it pisses me off cos 
I know 
like me I so wanna drive for the right bloody reason
Yeah
you know and, and these last couple of weeks with me mum I think oh if I could
drive you know, but I thought cor there's an idiot like him
On the road
Yeah, it ain't worth him passing his sodding test
No
I don't know how he did it.
Well, you don't know that, I mean it's, I, that's what I've said all the way along this, this world's getting to be that the wrong person 
Priorities wrong 
Yeah, the wrong people are in the wrong jobs
Yeah
ain't they?
yeah, that's quite worrying
Where did their daughter went to
yeah she came home
Did she?
Why was that?
Back at home, back at school and everything now, I don't know, she never ever told me the story, she used to talked to Steffy  she used to shut me off, and I thought I'd
no
but, I, I forget who it were, it were either Lyn 
That was strange cos she's the only daughter isn't she?
Yeah, I don't know the full story 
Mind you 
no, if Maureen's the same at, at home as she is at work then you can see why she left home 
well that's what we said, what we said 
so
I think she still sees Cathy at times
Who Maureen?
Yeah, yeah, I mean I've never seen nor heard
Mm, Cathy knew what they called her in the initial stage
that's right, yeah, that's right
I can't be doing with that
No I can't
I'm glad I'm out and I'm glad that I never see some of them bloody people again
Well
cos I said to Maureen have you seen anybody?
She said I saw Julie cos when I left Julie said to me,
Julie said oh if I
when I told Alan
oh well, we can't very well be whether Julie said she liked boys to go out with her, go, and we provisionally booked, I think it was the last week in February, we got quite a bit on, I said er if I can't make it I'll ring you, but then, oh that was it she rung me up, and she said Lynnie
I said no Julie I said I haven't I said I would tell you cos I said I, she said to me do ring me and let me know, and I said I said I would and I will, I said no cos I didn't tell her when it were you see, so I said it's this week coming and I'll ring you this on Monday, so she said oh it was only, cos she said I saw Deb and Deb wondered, I thought yeah I bet she did she would 
Yeah 
fucking laugh, so I said to her no I said it is this week Julie I said and it's towards the end of the week but I'll ring you by the weekend and let you know, well of course come the Thursday morning I haven't seen Val, and I was ever so upset because it really the end of the line money wise, I couldn't do any more
Oh
the end of the last straw you see, so I went in the Co-Op and I felt really, really fed up, I said I oh I said I could cry I said because I've tried so hard I said not for lending you money I said, I'm not meant to have any sodding luck so got a couple of bits and I really couldn't get me act together and on the Tuesday dad's gone in hospital with that fit, so I was thinking of him a lot and I thought I don't know dad, you know I'm sure, I'm sure that he weren't gonna come out when he went in there, I thought they were gonna bloody find something with you boy and that would be it, so I come home here and I ain't done no work, so I started off for work, both sitting here bloody bawling cos this house looked like shit, spoke to me sister on the phone and er I felt a bit better so I thought oh I'd start doing the tree, so I pulled it all to bits in here, got the polish and duster out, put all the bread and everything for Alan's sandwiches, it'd be about oh, about half past twelve and the bloody phone went it was mum, she said Lyn do you think you can come up to the hospital with me, cos I've got no transport and so I said what's up then mum?
So she said dad's got to go straight down now for emergency surgery, come on then, for emergency surgery and they want you to be there before he goes, oh christ perhaps I'm
and erm I said well, so I rung Alan up I said Al can you get out?
He said I can't I'm here on my own, he said get a cab and I'll give you the money back, so anyway I rung Pauline's husband up Steve and he said I'll take you, I said to Steve I've gotta get there for one o'clock cos I said I really do feel that if I don't see him before he goes I ain't gonna bloody see him, he was ever so good, he were here at twenty to one, got straight in the car put his foot down, went to the General and just as I got in the door Steve don't worry about me parking, go, I'll find you, just get in there, I ran through the bloody doors, ran up the stairs cos I knew
where he'd be, and they were just wheeling him down, him crying
Oh
must've been frightened, cos he's never had
in his life
Ah
So I held his hand all the way and mum was there and I said you'll be alright dad I said don't worry about it I said er, we'll be here when you come out, he said yeah alright, I'm alright, so as the surgeon came out he said look Mrs   he said I've seen your daughter, yeah, I have to say this to you he said it's a fifty, fifty percent chance that John will come back from the operation, operation OK and he said it's a one hundred percent chance he won't without surgery of course he don't know anything, got his little cap on
What and he heard him saying this?
Yes, said to me dad and all, but I said to me dad I love you, I've always loved you you know and I'll be here when you come out I said you'll be out don't worry, crying when he went in
when he went in mum started crying she said Lyn he ain't coming back he ain't coming back I said he might mum, he's just might so anyway that was, at one o'clock he went down, quarter past five, ring, we kept saying can you ring and see if, and they rung said be out the operating theatre to tell us how far they'd got and what was happening, he's had four units of blood
That was
Yeah
yeah it was the one leading to the aorta, an aorta, they call it an aortic
That's the main one to the heart then?
bigger and anyway he came back and he said
bloody packets of blood you know what oh, and it's ten percent of
and erm, and I missed the
he said and in all my years of surgery I've done a hundred and odd drainages and that is the biggest
I've ever done, he said and I'll be totally honest with you he said if I'd have known how big it was I wouldn't have done the operation he said I really didn't know what I've let myself in for, he said he's had problems with
leg and knee, he said he's got arterial disease and his arteries are all blocked, he said we've tried to put some
down into his arteries and we can't get anything down there so they're blocked, but he said how the hell he survived that op I don't know he said they could've done more with his legs but it meant another hour and a quarter minutes in surgery, and he said he'd had enough we couldn't have kept him on the table a minute longer  so he said all we can do is wait, so now mum said well he's alright in intensive care, he's responding well, getting over the operation well, but what we was worried about was him breathing on his own, had he, had he been you see, anyway he said this on er Thursday
this was on the Thursday and he said er we'll leave him on the
machine until Monday and then though we'll take him off, of course being on it for a long period
to his brain, then they comes the next day, oh no that was it, they, then they, we left it, we left it, we left it, he kept saying we might have to make a decision, erm your dad's leg deteriorated he's got no circulation in his legs at all, we've found a pulse in his left leg but we can't find one in his right, he said I think you're gonna have to make the decision of amputation  oh god, anyway comes Monday came off ventilator and of course he couldn't talk
He knew you where there though?
Yeah, he knew we were there, he was responding and erm, he said er, he's responding well to the operation and then on the Tuesday he went bright yellow and of course mum noticed it 
That's jaundice 
Yeah, so mum went into the ward and she said he's awfully yellow, is that normal?
So the nurse said to the sister she said he's got a bit of jaundice, but they were whispering and Pete said well dad, so mum said no bloody jaundice she said, he, he
then they got the
gotta come off
this was on, in the morning, in the afternoon they said his leg would deteriorate, they've got to take the whole leg off  so he said we'll give it another go and see what happens, course by this time he said the operation hasn't
the only reason that we could take his
we can't take him down and put that right, wouldn't make it, he said he'd
or any check
so anyway he went right on until the  Saturday and he said look, on the Friday they called us in and they said look we're gonna take him to the ward I'm afraid there's nothing else we can do, just deteriorating and he said there's no
which in a way were pleased we haven't got to make the heart rending decision of him having his legs off, cos Denny told us, mum kept saying to him for three days, he would arch his back  ooh, ooh, couldn't move, and mum said yes he
when he's down he can't move, I said yes he can, she said he can't, and three times she told them and it weren't until the third day, they apologise, they said I'm awfully sorry we didn't realise just how
because the
is so close to Dad's spine it's
Oh
but then on the erm, Saturday, and the, that's, and then on I say then on the bloody Friday night what happened he fell out the bed  I phoned
and I said can you tell me how dad's
so she said erm, erm, I said I only understand that he fell out of bed last night, so she said yes but he's quite comfortable now, I said is he, is he really?
I said well I'm gonna come up in the next hour and I wanna
who was on the ward last night and sister that was on today and I wanna know why and how he fell out of bed  when I got up there they said would you like to come in, I said I most certainly would, she said erm, what would you like to say?
I said what would I like to say, disgusted with the way he's been treated, I said my father left intensive care at one o'clock on Friday, we was told he was gonna leave there at four o'clock to go home and have a meal and be with him when he went on the ward, when we came back, he'd been moved, he'd gone on the ward, he was plonked in the chair, his catheter was on his lap, it had leaked all over him, his dressing was hanging off and seeping with green stuff  the wound on his leg was run all down over his foot, he'd got no cover on his seat so he could see, Dave said they looked and they didn't look very bloody nice
And your dad could see that?
Yeah, and I said erm, and I said that weren't, if that wasn't enough I said bearing in mind he'd just come out of intensive care off a life support machine, I said and which I think that, that tells us that he needs a bit of extra care compared to some of them on the ward, I said I know they're all important and I know you're busy but I said I think you should've had a bit of priority, he was dying, and you know he's dying, you'd been told, she said yes that's right, I said but what really broke my bloody heart was from one o'clock that dinner time he sat in that chair, we left that hospital at half past eight and you assured us he'd go to bed and when we came in the next morning at half past ten Joy he sat there exactly the bloody same, in the same filthy blanket and the same catheter on him, oh I went fucking mad and I said how dare you, I said because somebody's told they're dying does that mean they've got to be forgot?
I said he's my father  and then he falls out the fucking bed when they put him in it because they admit negligence, they forgot to put the cot side up, dad has got lack of oxygen to his bra brain, he thought it was the Battle of Hastings going on  but they said there was nobody there, well surely they must have known Joy he fell out the bloody bed because he's laying like this and he's falling and he's falling and bang come out, he split all his bloody head open, do you know the blood was there from the night he fell out, he fell out at half past ten at night and they never informed us, which is against the law and the blood still sat there at quarter to four the following day, all over the floor, he's got a bloody stitch in his head which they done to him while he were in the bed, and ripped three tubes out of his arm, split all his bloody arm open
And your mum knows all this?
Yes, we went fucking mad
 
Was he insured?
So you see I couldn't fight with them too much cos I thought they'd take it out on dad, so I said look I don't want him here, I don't need all this but I said another thing that got my goat, you asked my mum to help turn my dad, they asked my mum if she could help turn him because they didn't have enough staff or he couldn't be turned and when my mum turned him she come out and was sick and cried her eyes out cos he had no skin from the top of his spine to the bottom, and he had a water blister like that Joy yellow on his arm, his penis was nearly the width of my arm pouring with blood, and septic from the catheter, oh and the smell, you've never smelled nothing like it from the sores and the wounds, cos he was cut from here right the way down to here  and they had a, all his legs were festering and gangrene in his legs 
They'd been better off just giving him an injection and put him to sleep 
Yeah and Mike's seen him like that and mum went round the ward and she made all the beds to help them and all, we had to bribe them to look after him, but was he looked after in the end, on Saturday I said look, I said don't fucking come over here and tell me my dad's gonna be turned in a minute I said because a minute is a minute, I said but when you come over here three and a half hours later to my dad that's like three years, he's in excruciating agony, he wants to turn him when you tell him you're gonna turn him
Mm
I said I understand your busy, I said if you can't turn him say, then I will turn him in an hour I can't do it before, fine, I said at least I'm not sitting like a prat telling him a load of rubbish
Mm
and I said then on the, on the Saturday his leg, his wound, he come out of intensive care on the Wednesday and on the Saturday his, his dressing hadn't been changed on his leg and it reeked and I said can we actually please have a clean dressing for my dad's leg, even if I've got to put the bugger on myself, that was at quarter past eight
yes that was at quarter past eight Saturday morning and at ten to eight my aunty came at night and went fucking mad she said I want a dressing and I want it now, twelve hours ago I asked for that dressing and weren't done  then came
came up to say it was a matter of time he probably wouldn't last the weekend he was dying and he was on morphine tablets 
What she say, thanks to you lot so wondered he survived this lot .
I went mad , he said well accidents happen, I said not with my fucking dad they don't  not to my dad I said I'll tell you what Mr  if I'd have known then what I know now I wouldn't even let you operate, I wouldn't Joy I would have said leave him alone, I wished he'd have died when the
exploded
Mm
because it, all of that was terrible 
Was it, your dad was it?
That what I say there's a lot to be said for going gracefully 
Yeah, and then that was
come Saturday they'd rearranged the whole ward and they put him on a W R V S air bed, he were in heaven on this bed, I said why the fuck couldn't you have done that earlier?
He fainted when they moved him, it was such an upheaval thought we'd lost him then, and then on a beautiful air bed and he looked
it was too late came Saturday night he was on morphine tablets, I stayed with him all day Sunday, and I could see he was dying then, I stayed with him all night, all day, and then, gone Saturday night
four children, me mum all round the bed waiting for the bugger to
cos that's what they said, dad's so high on drugs and lack of oxygen, he's, he was comical, he was a bugger
Mm
you know we had a real laugh with him
mm
It didn't seem right, yet, looking at his face you'd, she'd thought he could have come home, but when you lifted the bloody sheets and then she'd never seen anything like it, and then on the Monday morning, I stayed with him Sunday night and he were on morphine fusions and then on the Monday morning I woke up and mum had gone, when I looked at dad I thought to myself then I thought oh boy you ain't gonna go now  mum nipped home for a bath they said she could and it'll be alright and they said
and er, that was at eight o'clock and er, then they all came back at about quarter past eight and er they sat us down and said daddy died at twenty to nine
In the morning?
Mm  but oh, they've
you can't do with it can you Joy?
No
I mean it ain't on is it?
I know they're short staffed 
When you need people 
but by Christ
when you need people, well it, there's, there's been a programme on this morning there saying it's not that there, this is vote for your, for your parliament you know, what you call it?
Your vote to phone in and they said erm  something about what was I gonna say  no what was I gonna say?
Oh no they were saying that the Health Service's and
the Health Service is deteriorating so bad, and they said no not so much that it's that they're not, they've got enough staff but they're not being managed correctly
Mm
they're, they're hovering around
That's right it's like there's no big 
don't know what to do 
it's like, I mean, I mean when I used to work in a hospital you weren't allowed to have hair down and hole in the tights, they're a load of toffee cows
No, I know,
not one of them doctors or an anaesthetist that come to dad had anything on, suit, trousers, jumper, floppy t-shirt, sweat shirt, no overall, no gloves nothing
no, no
I mean even us we we're going in and out intensive care having a fag, having a cup of coffee, walking in, we're full of germs  I mean at one time you used to have to have gloves you know, didn't you?
You know, dad got a chest infection 
Yeah, sterilized gloves 
see, the chest infection
Well you weren't surprised are you?
You see, I, I mean my brother 
But I mean the intensive care girls Joy I can't say enough about them, they were wonderful
Yeah, it's no good saying 
 
it's no good fifty percent of the ship being good 
that's what I said they thrown him out into a mad house 
you can't sink half a ship can you?
I mean they only threw him out because they just didn't, have the, the, the staff, I mean I sat in there day after day and I felt bloody sorry, they were ringing, ninety percent of their day taken by ringing, begging for staff
Mm
please, please could someone help just for an hour, we need help, we're too sh 
Mm
they were four, I mean there's only four beds but one day they had four in there but there was a need for urgency 
it makes you feel , it makes you feel when you're unemploy , ployed like they are 
Yes, that's what I said 
what are we waiting, but you see 
where are all these qualifications
yeah but you see, you, you, you can't 
you know 
do anything
no
cos if you go to do anything voluntary they look, look into it and then you've got trouble with your dole money
I know, that's it, yeah
then you can't afford to not have your dole money, cos your dole money 
 
The more I was up there, the more I thought cor I could take my coat off put on an overall, live up here forever 
That's right I know
you know helping people, there was so many things you and I could do
I know
and it was stupid things like 
Well that, that's why I think I went down so hard when I didn't get that job cos she said, I, I took, I took the erm, I went, I was the first, to go, first of all I didn't put in for this job it's one that's been laying around since last September, I wrote to, kept to St. Mary's for this mental health thing and I got in touch with this Mrs  and she said I've got nothing I can offer you at the moment but I, I will be in touch and I went down the job centre one day and erm, there was this thing to say that they wanted mental nurses
Mm
at the hospital, so I thought well I'll, I'll ring
Mm
anyway the girl said well I'll ring first to see where you get your application form she, and the, Sue  phoned and was on the other end and I said oh you should apparently you've got have erm, er, application form and Mrs  going to send you one, I said is that Mrs  on the line she said is that Mrs  speaking, she said yeah, I said will you tell it's Mrs  she said oh, well, tell Mrs  she's no need to apply I've got all her details and she is being looked at, you know, we are looking into it  anyway erm, as I say I had this letter just after Christmas to say that there was a job coming up at the Mencap at Wellingborough Road, Rushden, and I was being selected and erm would I go up for the informal interview on the Monday and the formal interview at the hospital the next morning, so I went up got the first person there and er she, she, it's a new, it's an old house but they've done it all up and there all papers on the floor and then she said oh I think I'll pick these up Ir Irene, I said oh call me Joy everybody does and she said alright, OK, I said oh I'll help you so of course I said, I went straight down with her on the floor picking all these papers up and she, and when the next person come she said poor old Joy ain't even got in the door and that's it, she's already working and she said I can see you're like me Joy you'll do a job when you see it's gotta be done, I said I've always been the same, I can't, I can't see a spoon or a bit of paper laying on the floor
No
I have to pick it up, she said oh that's good, as I say I had a brilliant interview when the other members of staff come Steve and erm, I forget what the girl's name was, but she's already had a
from her, training that er Princess Marina, and said oh this is Joy and this is Jenny and er, she's done well and when I came away Jenny went just in front of me into Sue who works for me Sue  she's, she's the, the area, the area manager
Mm
and she said has
come in?
I really feel she said, I hope that we can sort something out, but the next morning of course I was first on the list I had my formal interview, mine was half past nine, but when I got in there Sue, and Steve which was gonna be the head manager and this girl from erm Princess Marina who was gonna be the nurse
Mm
who would administer all the drugs etc, erm, they come in and they said right just take a sit Joy and you know make yourself comfortable, I said oh fine and I sat, sat in the chair said well I'll sit with these for me dining room and I'll have four for me bedroom and
do you want me to sit here then?
She said yes, cos they sat like one, two, three and I said hang on where's the plug, what time do you plug it in, you know ,
Yes 
a mate of mine said dead right, she said now, were not used to doing this she said so if you feel you haven't had a fair crack at the whip
Mm
on your interview she said I want you tell us because at the end of the, your interview she said, it'll help us to do the others, so they told us, giving me different situations, she's took a patient out to a cafe and the patient pinched a cake and eaten it, what would you do?
So I said well I've never been in the situation but I said if it, if it was, if I was in that situation I, asked to see the manager or person in charge, make an offer to pay for any damage that was done and if that didn't suffice then I would say well I am the care officer for a Mencap home and the only thing I can do is say will you er get in touch with my boss and it'll have to be sorted out from Head Office and she said perfect, you couldn't do anything better, then she give me all different things that we've gone into the next day and the patient's done everything down the bed, what would you do?
Mm
So I told them what I would do, but once again I've never been in the situation but this is what I'll do, said as if they were me own parents make them as comfortable as I could while I'll cleaned up and give them a bed bath or if they could shower, shower them and erm and get everything back to normal as quick as possible, fine, that were all fine she, and then as, as I got up from it they all said thanks a lot Joy it has been great you really have been great you've made it easy, we've got an easy day in front thanks to you, you know you're bubbly and all this and  then when she phoned me on the Sunday she said hello Joy it's Sue here and I, I said will you let me know one way or the another cos I said I hate being left up in the air 
Yeah, that's right 
she said oh yes you will, then she said to me I'm sorry to tell you you didn't make, she said you made exc , but she said I don't want you to feel erm disgruntled she said because er, you done a fabulous interview, the only thing that let you down was of lack of experience, so I said well you're never gonna get any cos you, nobody let's you in, they don't open the door
That's right 
I said I've been waiting six months now, I've given my life six months to wait for a job, I said, you can't get experience if you're not given chances 
No 
so I said but I'm not disappointed but she said just listen to what I've got to say, she said, erm, because anybody else that's failed we've just said I'm sorry we can't have you, but she said with you, we all feel that you've got so much to offer she said I'm gonna offer you a relief post which means that you can go into other people's ho er other homes, all around, all different hospitals if somebody's short, they can call on you and I said could it be a full time job, will it give me enough money to say that I'm working?
She said I can't promise you, so I thought well I'm sat six months now, so I phoned this ship thing yesterday on the telly called Just Start, no Start Again whatever it's called and they gave me, they phoned me yesterday and they gave me a number of Cine Hill, Northampton which is the job advisory centre, adults education and then they phoned me yesterday and they told me who to get in touch with so I've got an appointment Thursday at erm Northampton with the Social Services Department and they apparently map out all the places where you could go, say, say for instance that St Crispin's is the mental home I can go there and be with the patients and then I can go to the Marina's and be taught how to lift and how to bed bath and how to manipulate
Soon knowing, it's only a fashion like 
sick people 
the Y T S training scheme yeah 
That's right , and she, she retired Friday so she said I must get you in before Friday cos I'm going round Thursday morning 
Oh isn't there courses at Tech in the evenings or, or nothing?
Well that's what she's gonna tell me  so 
I don't know how you'll suppose to learn to get an interview
 
well I thought well if it checks me another six months at least when they say have you got any experience, but as I say I'm still in touch with Mencap and I'm still in touch with mine and I've also er put in for, what they call them mobility insistence for the Princess Marina which again an education and you just go in and be, be a friend to somebody and you take them out for an hour, er a couple of hours, you, and you're paid five pounds eighty for a two hour session
Yeah
whether it's the afternoon or an evening or weekend it's still the same price, but the, the mental patient actually employs you, you're not employed by the hospital, but they can only give you ten hours a week which is five session so that's only sort of twenty seven quid a week so you're
yeah I didn't really want to go with 
 
I, I, you see, I don't really wanna do Mencap, I didn't
no
I, I didn't want mentally handicap I wanted mentally sick like schizophrenic
very interesting 
alcoholic they abilitating teaching them to, to live again and, and getting into the community, helping them to shop and you know helping them to be self sufficient.
When I was at  Tesco's near where we work, we worked, when we were at Hodins, you know that Tesco's there?
Yeah
That day when I went up to my
Yeah
the first time I noticed there were no end of women like yourself with no end of
That's right
you know in wheelchairs, or just walk
Yeah 
and they were obviously quite poorly people in the way of their, their mental state
Mm
and er I thought of you then, and I thought where could they all come from, really are
where do you come from because
Mm
six or seven times when I walked down Tesco on a lunch time on my own, they're always at the end one, so I suppose they could get in and out, but they're lovely kids some of them
Mm
I mean, they're not kids all of them 
They go to a bowling alley as well they do 
Yeah 
and they went 
and I notice when we went, we went to see Chas and Dave er at the Derndan it was packed with them
Mm
and as soon as you've parked, they've obviously come from a home somewhere or from the hospital or whatever 
Oh they come from, they go 
you see, I mean what they do is soon as they've kicked them out in the mental homes they're having to put them in to erm, I mean erm, there are people who are not able to be on their own, I mean the ones they've kicked out are people that have been depressed and say well you've got to find, get your family to help, I mean, when you've got somebody depressed in your family you try and help them 
That's right, yeah 
with their help and medication, I mean you don't sling them out on the street
No
I mean I don't, I don't know whether say they flung them out on the street is the right thing, cos I, I, I mean there's all these places like Mencap and there's a big one in Wellingborough
Yeah
and MindBlank which is mentally erm 
Yeah 
insane
but there is a lot I mean, but how do you get in?
That's right, yeah, I mean, it's alright them saying you want experience but how do you get it if you know you can't learn 
That's right , so I'm hoping Thursday it's an advisory erm session and they tell you what you should do, what you, how to get there, you know
Yeah, because I mean, like when I had the home erm, that again obviously you can't, people said that, I mean, it's changed a lot but when I had the home you didn't just pull an , out anybody from the street and call them care assistants you had to offer them a day's training every week 
Mm 
at the Tech or courses, induction courses, Social Services meetings and stuff like that, but I mean there ain't none of this now they're just, you just, I, I can just apply for the job of care officer, care assistant and, and go in, but it's a pity that they don't do the same sort of thing like people can come in, have a look round see what goes on, be offered a, a day release
Mm
so like perhaps, say six weeks you're doing it on the voluntary basis
Mm
where you're just watching, helping, washing a few cups with somebody and, and then going on a course one or two days a week, and then you're consider whether being took on and even if you're not took on at that place at least you've got something to say you've done when you're 
Apart from that 
applying for another placement 
yeah apart from that you've got to know whether it's what you want to do
That's right, oh yeah, because I mean 
I mean, I mean I know I don't really want to work with old age pensioners, but I start in a 
No, it's depressing 
no I don't think I wanna just sit and wash somebody sitting in a chair 
Very, I would say it's not depressing that's the wrong word, there's no  there's a sense of, of reward and achievement, but, there ain't no thanks in it, no gratitude about it 
No 
do you know what I mean?
I mean I've just, but all the years that I was at the home every day I would say hello Flo, hello Elsie how are you?
Ooh, ooh this hurts and that hurts, never have, well how are you me duck
Yeah
do you know what I mean?
You'd expect about ta, thanks you used to think cor christ and then I, I mean all the bits I did for them and I remember one woman getting up saying come on Flo come and stretch and she said who are you?
And I'd been there four year, really, wipe shit from her arse every morning 
Yeah, yeah 
didn't know who I am
that's right
and that can be a bit soul destroying
Yeah
You, you really want something that, with the younger people you can build up a proper relationship 
You can get rapport with them, yeah yeah
and an understanding and a bond
That's right
whereas with old people you can't, cos they're so cantankerous anyway
Yeah
but,
well I say I'm just, I'm just trying 
keep trying , don't give up
Yeah
Yeah, cos at least you know 
I mean he 
what you wanna do, which is something you didn't when you were at
no, no 
did you?
You didn't really know what path to take or what you wanted to be
Well I'm virtually unemployable, let's face it I mean
Well it's like Callum,
come out of his job, he knows nothing, he's a great butcher, never get another butcher like him, but that's all he knows
Mm
If he don't, if he comes out and decides to do something else he's well and truly
Well that's right
gazumped, because nobody will take him, cos he knows absolutely nothing, about nothing else apart from butchery, it's the same with me I can't work a computer so I'm cramped in the way of clerical, it's no good applying for half of them because you've got to have keyboard skills and erm computer skills 
But you see that's what you should do now you should get in and do it while you're unemployed.
But you see, you get a lot of these courses and, I went in for reflexology, I went on a lovely
Come here.
a lovely course for re reflexology and one day, I went to Shambrook College and he said to me you've got, you've got a great feeling with your hands he said, you, you, you'd make a good reflexology, but the courses were in Luton
Yeah
and when you're unemployed you can't afford to go thirty miles 
You can't afford it, course you can't 
twice a week, I, for nothing
that's what I said to mum, you know, that's why I so wanted to pass me, me test, cos I said to mum erm, see I kept it, I only had six hundred quid redundancy, six hundred and twenty eight pounds, that's all I had, apart, I had me wages what was owed and me holiday pay, but my, me actual redundancy cheque was only six hundred and twenty eight quid 
Yeah, I only got six hundred 
so I've put that away, I, it ain't even in my account, Alan's got that and I said to Alan if I pass this test I shall buy a banger, five hundred quid with this tax money and then put the odd to insurance, if I don't I'll leave it where it is, because I, I mean little one will want a holiday and that anyway so I've kept it for that, but that's what I intend to do, so I said to Alan if I get a little banger just enough to get me to Tettering and back I was gonna go tech, to do some courses
Mm
see I can't afford the train for every bloody day
Yeah I know
it's one pound ten one way then you oh 
but you see there, that I was saying to Penny 
Do you want a cup of tea Joy?
make sure I see her this week, so she said oh she said Penny is a good girl she said er  there was Penny and Margaret working at G P P and she said they were both doing test but she said come the end of day they only wanted one she said and for that, so she said Penny stood back and let Margaret stay  to keep her job 
But 
that's alright innit, you're just trying to get comfy.
They're old as the hills them cushions, in fact they're
Do you want tea or coffee Joy?
I don't mind whichever one you're making
Mug or a cup?
Mug please.
What sugar?
One and a bit.
OK
Yeah go on then, that'll do  yeah  now this is the famous budgie is it?
Pardon?

That's George, famous George 
Georgey , Georgey
He's been

Yeah  getting old
Is he pulling his feathers then?
Hello, what you doing down there?

oh Dennis he's ever so 
I'll tell you one thing I, I take the top off
He's ever so finicky Lyn
   

alright, have your water
Is that strong enough for you or is it too weak?
No it's lovely
He's got turkey salad and he didn't even eat it  so I took the, the top off it so he could see the turkey in it, then he changed his mind now, I thought he might.
What's he got?
Are you warm enough?
Yeah
Sure?
Yeah, a turkey sandwich, oh he's cheeky
Not on the settee
No it's alright
You spoil him, what you got?
The trouble is he does it everybody's house
What you got?
Aren't you sure about that?
He's ever so finicky to feed  but don't worry about your driving you haven't lost it
No, it takes a bit of time doesn't it?
Well when you could do with it most
Yeah, with all, with all the running around at the hospital and all that, and now, and now 
Alright now?
and as you say if you go to college, but as I've said to Penny you know you want to try and find out if there are any courses that are going, if you want to get back 
Yeah, that's what I thought 
into office work  you feel you like, want to go back into it?
I'm sure I know
Oh, I tell you what
it got on my wick the bitchiness of it all, didn't you, I couldn't, I couldn't do with it Joy I don't think 
everybody 
I want to do that again
everybody said that what a 
 
I couldn't do with it now
Do you know the reason, the reason Maud phoned to told me it was the most hateful place
Oh
Tim  the, the life insurance, you know the man who still do the pensions on?
Oh yeah 
He said Joy it was a wicked
It needn't have been need it?
Well it, you know what I call it, seeping sewage, I said
Tell me off 
 
They usually say that the things called rising damp I said this
that was seeping sewage from the top
I think Geraldine remembers a lot of it I really do
They all do, wanna hear what Barbara's got to say
here ain't she?
Fine, yeah, she come over my house last Wednesday night, we go to the Beaker's bingo  just won't let you

Geoff cooked him a pheasant
Oh yeah
Yeah
I've got a great big rabbit in the freezer.
He's ever so spoilt that's the trouble 
He don't want the crust, he don't want the crust
No he don't like nothing hard, he loves chee , he likes cheese and things like that
yeah he'll, he'll eat it, he's following you
No I'm alright
You sure?
Yeah
Lyn
Yeah
Reggie  don't you think I'm fat enough?
Chinese porcelain, I wouldn't dare,
right, so I had the insurance man come up, come about my pension, he sat where you are and I sat there, he was a well to do man

Yeah, so how she doing not good?
She's had a lot of ups and downs, Christmas, New Year's Eve night Rudy and I went to a party, Pam's daughter's party, it's her eighteenth and at quarter to twelve when they started getting ready to ring the chimes in, at midnight Wendy said I can't stay Joy I'm gonna have to go I said oh alright then, I said I see you alright, are you alright?
She said yeah I'll be alright, but I could see she'd been crying earlier on in the evening, she said you always feel as if you're
That's horrible isn't it?

Well anyway Wen, Wen was in bed with flu, he was with mum so when we went up to pick him up about ooh twenty past twelve I said to and Rudy, I said to Rudy I'm, I'm worried about Wendy, he said are you?
This is New Year's Eve?
Yeah, I said yeah I am, I said I'm gonna drive up and see, so we got in, went up to Wendy's, you couldn't see through the door Pen, Penny and Kev said well we'll drive round as well, I said well she's had us up and down, cos one minute she was quite strong then the next she couldn't cope, I said Wendy all I want you to ever know is that I'm there, if ever you want me phone me, I don't care whether it's middle of the night, middle of the morning or whatever, so she says alright, anyway Penny went up, she said she couldn't see anything she thinks she's gone a bed and then me and Rudy went up, it must have been quarter to one cos I took him for a little walk and I got out the car and walked round the back and then, I could see her curtains were open and I could see a light on, so I went round the front and I shouted through the letter box, Wen it's only me I've come to wish you a happy new year, let's hope next year will be better than this one and she come to the door and she was broken hearted
Ah
so I said to her come on I said come on you'll gotta start trying to be strong, I know it's a nasty night being celebration night when everybody else looks as if they're enjoying 
Yeah 
Anyway when I went in the phone was on the hook, and I said who was on the phone?
She said the Samaritans she said Joy I were gonna commit suicide, and she said I thought well I'll just talk to the Samaritans and she said that's where I were, I said you won't commit suicide will you?
She said I can't cope no more, she said I just cannot cope any longer and I said you mustn't feel like that I said you'll break all our hearts, I said it's, life will never be the same again, I said come on home with me, forget about this day, I said tomorrow we'll come and pick your birds up cos she's got two beautiful parrots, she's got a  Mulican white with peach
Oh
and then she's got one of them blue erm ones, what'll you call them?
Macaws
Really?
and they're worth about three grand  so anyway erm, I said I'll pick your birds up tomorrow and, cos I
when you come and stay with me, she, anyway she, she wouldn't, well in the end I just said that's it I've had enough I switched the car off and grabbed hold of her I said, frogmarched her in the car I said come on, I'm going to bed, Rudy's ready for bed I said I want you with me, so that I can keep me eye on you if I have to sit up all bloody night, of course when she was with me I picked her up and got her strong again and I say you have to be worth it, you're better off without him then she come round and then she'd say I know I am I just go down 
 
but well anyway she say, the next morning I said to her do you wanna go home and get some clothes and come back here?
She said no I think I'll go home I'll be alright, so I took her back home about eleven and erm  erm I kept phoning her every hour on the hour just to make sure she's alright, then I said I want you just to promise me one thing you're not do anything silly, I'm here, I don't care what it takes, I'm here, so she said alright then, so I said it'll break mum's heart it'll break dad's heart,
No,

Yeah but I mean you, there are times when you feel weak and that  I mean
But you see Penny can't Penny can't accept that she'll say 
no they never been in it,

I have, and I you know, there's been many a day I've thought cor I'm really glad I'm in, I'm really glad that I didn't give, giving up day and there's been days when I thought christ how the hell did you get through that day
Mm
it seems like now to tell you at last I've come to terms with it now, I've really 
Yeah 
feel like I've accepted it, I've come to terms with it, there's nothing I can do about it
fair to your control and once you get to

your control you've, its nothing you can do 
but it took five years 
I know
I mean that, I was telling my mate Cheryl  they come to the funeral, he ain't fucking shown

Whatever for 
He come up the hospital, I was up in intensive care unit and me dad came round about half past ten at night and in he walked, he came straight down from Filey to see him, cos he used to think a lot of dad you see and dad did him years ago, he used to say he was more of a son than me own  but then he brought her to the funeral, they wouldn't speak to me, wouldn't entertain me at all, I nearly fainted when I saw little one, she's tall and thin 
Are they spoilt?
Oh, everyone knows them

I'll have to go backwards.
Excuse me, young man  well you ain't sharp like your mother are you Reggie?

It was lovely this morning 
Yeah,
I weren't gonna put myself out for them  then he got up and stormed out and then he went back to his sister's took his
out and never said ta ta to anyone, I mean I ran over and I said to mum he's got a funny on, what do you think?
So I said I know what he's like, comes back and he turns up he says we're just off now, I said oh you've come back then I thought you were a bit rude just storming out of the funeral and not saying cheerio to everyone, he said I've been insulted long enough by your family, I wouldn't be, I wasn't prepared to be insulted any more
Ooh 
Bloody shark, he ought to grow up
pathetic
so we all had a laugh about it when we went off, I said come on who's the culprit who upset god above from Yorkshire?
Sammy  said must have been me he said all I said to him here are Ton here's a mug of tea, mug for a mug
I said that'll be it, that's all he'll take

It's a good job that, he didn't take that mug that I've got, I'm a mug for a reason
Yeah, well weren't it daft, I thought that was clever

show them the garden, by Saturday night I felt shattered for it and I'd come home and I looked in the cupboard and I said Ton well what do you want for your dinner then?
He said nothing, he said you ain't gotta cook Jeanie and Rob have invited us down, he's
and she's doing you a spaghetti bolognaise, so I said oh that'll be nice, when we got there, shall we go in the bank for an hour, I didn't feel like going out, he said come on it'll do you good,
we went in the bank and I won a house on the bingo, you could of cracked me Julie said if we win we'll go halfs I said right you are so we said right that was fine, there was four of the bleeding winners one  pound fifty I ended up with 
It ain't enough for a bloody round, I said that was about right
but it was a bit of fun you know
Yeah
while we were out and er 
Oh I love me bingo
and we, we were ever so disappointed with the service at the, at the Crown ever so disappointed
At the Crown, why?
Mm , cos mum had Reverend  come round, you see cos dad weren't, none of us were religious least of all dad, he couldn't do none of it, so we said to, we didn't, we didn't know what vicar to choose cos none of us go to church so me mum said dad used to go to the church where me sister got married to the little Derby and Jones twice a week and Reverend  is always there so mum said we'll have him, dad got on well with him, he liked him, he knew dad, anyway he come round to see mum and I weren't there cos I had to go and sign on, I bloody wished I had been, anyway she said, she told him all about dad and she said I want you tell everybody how brave he was in the war and what a good father he were and a good provider and how he lived for his grandchildren and so on and so on, she said I don't want no hymns I just want his own organ music all through the service and nothing else and just some, do a couple of prayers, she, so he said right the Lords Prayer will be fine that'll be nice, well he never said nothing, he said I didn't know John  but he said I've been told he was a good man, he worked in a hospital, which he did, but I mean you're only like an engineer we weren't really emphasising on that and that was all he said, he played a bit of the organ music before we went in, a bit as we come out and there was about eight bloody prayers and the songs and everything read out and made us sing a hymn  ever so disappointed, hardly said anything, hardly play, played his music, no, I was well disappointed about that
Oh no  folks don't do what you ask
nowadays, do they?
No they do not
Oh I don't know I get disillusioned
Did you get a bed?
What were you after a single bed or a double bed?
Got it

I got a brand, almost brand new one
What double?
Divan with four drawers, headboard, like this headboard
Mm
only it's a bit more rosier than this is like
in it, the other one's, my one's rosy and erm, and a nice mattress, hardly used mattress, twenty five quid the lot, I'm well pleased with it, I've just had a lovely weekend, I've had Val and her husband over from Jersey

Erm  erm scanner, magnetic scanner 
Oh yeah , yeah

Oh

Oh what a shame
but she sold her house in Jersey, her husband retires in July, the school break, and erm and she said I've got some good, er when I got home from wherever I'd been, Rudy left me a note to say phone Val good news and I thought it were her back was good news, but she said no me medical problems were not good news, they daren't operate cos me back's in such a state and they haven't give her much hope for anything apart from a wheelchair sort of thing, later on in life and erm, but she said that I've got a bit of good news I've sold me house so I said ooh lovely, so she said I don't know any more but I ring you and let you know, the next night she phoned me back, she said yeah me house has gone they got two hundred and twenty thousand for it , they wanted them out a week on Thursday
Oh my god
She's going
Yeah
said she phoned me the night before last and she said she's been looking at flats I thought I'd just ring you to tell you we've been looking at flats and they range from two hundred and fifty to four hundred and eighty pounds a week for a flat
A joke
So I said what you gonna do?
I said you'd be better off to book into a guest house
Mm
and I, but you see John's ever such a funny eater, he's erm
Mm
erm, don't eat meat, what you call vegetarian 
Vegetarian , yeah
He'll eat fish, but he won't eat meat and erm, so probably likes a  he likes to do his own thing, I said well you ought to book in a hotel and
Yeah
bed and breakfast rather than have to pay out all that 
That's right 
so erm, you know, you know my millionaire friends from Jersey that I used to talk
Yeah
about, Tim and Pat
Yeah
well they've got a guest house where they rent, they let five of the rooms off in the summer to such millionaires
Oh yeah
and they just do bed and breakfast and I said I'm sure cos she knows Pat, she knows Val through me
Mm
so I said if you go up and see Pat I said I'm sure Pat will say well you know why don't you use the kitchen and come and live in 
Yeah, yeah 
I mean if you're gonna pay them you might as well pay Val 
Might as well, yeah that's right 
pay Pat and, and, and share her home
Mm
at least you'll live in the land of luxury, so she said I might just do that, so, well I'm not getting involved, let them sort it out
That's right
So erm I think John's gotta retire he suffers from these dreadful headaches now, they cri , they're killing him
Shame
the pain is so intense
Everybody's so poorly ain't they?
I think a lot of it's just a whole, everywhere is discontent at the moment, I dunno
Very poorly
I don't know whether it's that we want much, too much
 
I don't know what it is 
but we're not
 
it seems to have changed over the last few years
but I tell you what Val's put me back on my feet
Did she?
ooh, when I told her how I'd been treated
Yeah
she said you let them treat you like that,
Yeah
I couldn't believe it, she says I'm, well 
at the bingo the other night she
She never even said to ask me
I said to

I said you can put that away I've failed
Didn't you?
No,
No
never liked her, she knew it and all, and that last day I walked out I said bye, bye Debbie, she said, she went, she got in, in the car quick
and I wound her up so that she weren't too sure, do you know what I mean?
I wouldn't have
I'm glad that's the only thing I'm thankful for 
they said oh we've done 
being out of there, well I never 
they said oh hope we don't have a
reunion
Yeah I'm bleeding sure 
I'm sure that 
Yeah
all the girls will want all to get together I said no
No
I don't want to know, I said I don't want to know
Nor do I
So she said 
that was the laugh with David he said erm, he said about that and that cos when he had this, they had this big farewell thing didn't they at the bowling alley and I never went and I was the only one  and erm they come round, they come round and I thought yeah I really 
 
Is that the one Pam went to?
Yeah, they come round and they were all on about it and er, erm and that was it, Darren called us all into the canteen, well I, I mean Pam must have told you that I was, I couldn't get over it and he said thanks for all you've done, all your support and I thought yeah 
 
yeah, well they called us in the canteen
and they said everybody there's a meeting, so I thought oh christ cos it was just a standard joke me and Elaine, cos the last meeting they had, I were at the leisure shop then and they called the meeting to tell us it was the end and it was closing, and me and Elaine sneaked down the hall and we were going like this
you see, so, after that shop it came over the tannoy me and Elaine
staying open, I ain't going, I can't handle it I said I just wanna get out, it was really like a sentence I just couldn't stand it  of course I laughed, me and Elaine went to the meeting same place, same wall and I kept looking at her and we brought you in here to say thanks, and Elaine looked at me and I looked at her and I said well if that's all he's gotta say I said I'm not, I, what did I say to Elaine?
I said don't hold your breath Elaine but if it's what I think's in that carrier bag over there it ain't a voucher, cos they all were saying
What were it?
I wonder if we've got twenty five pound voucher there would be some oh greed at the front you know, and there was a, all of us attended this meeting and that's every single person in the building and I bet there was fifteen  maximum twenty, that was all that was left in the whole building
Is that the day Jane  asked them about the pension, how much there'd
 
No, that was pension no that was another day, and then he said and there's just a small token of thanks, so I said small it's fucking minu minute
and for twenty of us there was two half pound boxes of Dairy Box  I said are you sure you can afford it?
He said he climbed up squabbling, seven Debbie  had in her hand  you never seen nothing like it Joy I couldn't, oh it made me really ill 
Cor I don't know all about it 
Really make a bundle of laugh 
I just, I tell you what , I, I know it sounds nasty, but I am glad that Penny is some way has had something that has made her realised what that place was all about.
Yeah, cos you couldn't see it
No
No I know, I know she couldn't 
she never, never could , and I said what I tried to tell you all
Mm
I knew,
that day when I said to her I always remember on one occasion 
I knew 
I remember as clear as day, standing talking to Penny and I was calling their plumber, I'll always remember that and er I was quite took back and Penny said ooh she's been very good to me
Yeah
and I thought oh Penny if only you knew
Yeah
she ain't mate, she might be on the outside but she really ain't, cos Penny's such a lovely girl and I thought, and I thought, I've seen Penny butter up 
Penny who?
You think you see, my mate Penny 
to her and I've seen her laugh
but you see Penny's got no compassion, although she's me sister
Mm
she's got no compassion for nobody else, as long as Penny's alright, Penny's alright and, I mean, I don't, I don't say, say your own, to be
Say what's in your mind, I like people like that
Mm, mm
but I don't, I didn't like this if people didn't like what I, there was other women
That's right
 
 
not straight to me at all 
That's right
and there was only two people I felt comfortable, two and that was Barbara and June, that, that the two people I felt, one of them looked
Yeah
and when I said that to Penny she said well that's nice she said you've gotta lot of, a lot of friends at home, I said no, I haven't got friends 
You know 
I know people
Yeah
that put up with me, I know people that don't like me
Mm
and I know people that 
you suss it out 
do like me, I can tell you all about others from three weeks after I there, I was there I could have told you everything about it 
Suss it up 
Every one of them I told them all about peep hole 
I mean it's like when I walk in 
looked what he's done to them
Yeah
He wouldn't even give Pam a typewriter, he sold it under her nose 
I know, I know , because as I say they gave a
and he said I know who I'd believe, I said who would you believe?
She said well I know, cos when Elaine went to pick it up she said, Elaine told her I wouldn't want to make the choice out of two typewriters, I just said Pam didn't really care what she had as long as she had one 
Yeah I wanted one, it weren't even mentioned.
and he said and, and, and Pam said when Elaine asked Keith  he said if she can't come here and pick one up, she don't get one, I said and that is as much as Keith  thought about any of you
Oh yeah
 
I said and you all used to look at him as if he was bloody king 
king 
when you're playing cards
That's right
take me for a prat of the first order
That's right
and I told you that from the minute he sat down and he started playing, I'm a card shark, nobody tells me what I know about bloody cards 
That's right 
and when he used to say things about cards, I said you can't do that, but because he were who he is we had to shut our mouth 
He thought he had to be right , yeah that's right
but he weren't right
No
and I told him he wasn't 
That's right , that's exactly right 
I told him you don't pull the wool over my eyes, you might pull the rest, it over the rest, not this one, I said if you wanna play cards 
That's what happens 
with me, you play the rule, but when they came in and they said all this 
 
thank you, Keith, Daryl said to Keith I want a word now
you know, and I stood there, I mean there weren't a lot, I didn't have no back-up, when everybody went
No
there weren't many that sort, that felt the way I did, I mean I hated him, I really did and when he turned round and he said ooh Keith wants a few words I said to Elaine, look shit's gonna be it,
I'll tell him or anyone, and I meant it, so he started on about this night at the bowling club, but it was his actions Joy, I want to know who's coming, we need to know, I thought but why's he fucking boss me about on my private time, anyway to cut a long story short they booked all this night out and I watched and I waited I thought let them clock that I'm not going, so then comes a phone call, David  was in the bottom office so was the letter shark, and this phone call came over and David  shouted up to all of us on the machine who's going on Thursday night?
Of course they're all putting their hands up by me see, and Da , I thought David would clock, and he never said a word, I thought he ain't sussed it, anyway they went on this night out and the girls kept saying, Debbie saying oh Lynn just come, I said I ain't got no intentions of coming, I said David's going amongst all the others I'm not going, so Debbie  said why, I said why because David  is nothing but a wanker, a lot, along, a lot of the others, she said, she nearly fell off the chair, gordon bennett she said I never thought you, I never realised you felt like that, I said Debbie if you knew half of what I thought you would fall off that chair
Yeah
and then the next day I was in that shop working away and on my life this was
 

I said are you looking at me David, or is there a dog in here?
Cos I wouldn't, the only reason I kept  stoom was for my redundancy, it was only six hundred quid, but every ha'penny I want to get off them, do you know what I mean?
He come hareing up, you know, he's a prat ain't he?
He said  where were you last night?
I said put that finger down and I might tell you, I said don't point at me David I don't like being pointed at and Maureen nearly fell over, Maureen stood there, she nearly fell over
Oh
so he said  I said I don't have to tell you where I were last night David, I were out, so I said even if I were in it's none of your concern I said what I do in my private time is up to me, he said well why wasn't you there?
Oh did he?
I said I pretend I'd never heard that question David, because if I answer it  I said there's a lot more 
He knew what 
could be at stake
yeah I know
than my job  then he said I presume you've got mixed feelings, I said no my feelings aren't mixed up at all, I'm quite, I'm quite sure of my feelings of what I know, I said David I wouldn't associate myself, I wouldn't drink  and I wouldn't go out with anybody in this building  and he nearly fell over and he said dare I ask why?
I said don't ever dare
cos I said you'll be here to midnight David  and then on the day we were going he stopped me and Jane, little Jane, she was coming down the stairs behind me, I'd been up for a fax, and I don't know where she'd been, she was behind me and as she come down the stairs I was listening and he said  got her hand ooh he said I am gonna miss you my dear, so she said yes I'll miss Hodems as well, he said you have got a way with your words haven't you, he said for one strange minute I thought you were gonna say you'll miss me too
I said oh David you are naive
I said you're more naive than what I thought cos he hates, he hates me and vice versa, and he said er, who asked your opinion?
I said no bugger ever asked my opinion David but you can guarantee I'm always there to give it
you see him, his face was like thunder
But you see, that, that night Penny were called in
Ah
she were going it, she were going home, ten to six and they just, can we 
Oh I cried when Penny went I really did, I said you with a temper  and that last day you know, we all got a bucket filled it up with ash trays, dog ends, bits of paper, oh I don't know what was in it 
What you do, stick it in the fountain?
No, stuck it over David's head, he were on the phone to a client, we took a photo, somebody took a photo of it, we knocked on the door we said David have you got a minute?
He said no I'm on the phone and then they took a photo and that, Geraldine was there and they tipped the whole fucking bucket on his head, he had dog ends in his hair, and everything and he went you, he didn't know what to say, and we said see you David all the best.
Have you got your money then?
Yeah  no we haven't, no we haven't been paid yet, no that's, that's right we hate to got back with
Cos Jenny, Jenny  owes Barbara a lot of money you know.
I saw her and I, I be honest with you I hid, I be totally honest and I'll tell her the same if I see her because I've just found out then that they couldn't do any more for me dad and I really didn't want to speak or see anybody and I sat in the canteen on my own, I just said to me mum, mum on the phone I said mum I need to do this on my own I said I'm just gonna have a coffee in the cafeteria and I don't know if you've been in there but the cafeteria is all glass and she pulled up in a white van delivering something to the office, I thought oh no it's Jenny she's the last bleeding person I want there, I don't mean that
you know, and so I avoided her, but I would tell her, but if I saw her I would say Jenny I must admit I did see you going in The General but I didn't come out because I was so upset, but I, I wonder what she's doing, cos she, I heard she's got her own business, but I can't see that.
I know but she owes a lot of people a lot of money 
Might have been
cos she, you heard about all the union didn't you, what happened with the union down there?
They split it between everybody
The union money or your
Yeah, you know, you know 
Which?
we all come out of the union
Who split the union money then?
Well when you all went, as you all left, when the last lot of redundancies were made, I said I'm not paying no more union, Judith come over about the union meeting, I said I'm not going to the meeting Judith and I said I want to come out of the union I'm not paying any more, I said I can't afford ten pound a month for crap, well me and Jan had a big barney over it cos I never got on with her anyway and we had a big fucking row about it, she said the union this, the union that, I said where were the unions with my mates, they weren't in damn site, they were never there, we never saw one union representative from the day Audrey got done and we never ever saw erm till the last one got done, I said so don't you tell me about the union I said they did fuck all, they weren't even here, so I said I don't want to pay the union, and I said don't tell me what to do Jane, I said what I do with me money is up to me I said get me out the union and get me out now, and then they all started, they all wanted to come out of it then, oh Maureen I think I might but what would Debbie say, I said Maureen do you ask her for a shit?
You not got a mind of your own, do what you want to do
Well that's, that's the trouble you see they're all mindless aren't they?
Well then they all come out , everybody, even Dave  come out of the union and the only two that were left in it were Jane and Karen on our side and a couple from the warehouse and like there was Judith and I think Sonyou and a couple from the letter shop I, I, I don't know, I don't think Elaine went but I think the rest were, yes there were Pam and I think, I think Nigel were, but anyway when Judith comes up about what union money was left, I don't know where it was left from or how it's imposed, but they split the
between everyone, they had thirteen quid each
Did they?
and a little master Jane she said that was good weren't it?
I said you taking the piss out of them Jane or what?
I said you ain't sharp I said you've got all your priorities wrong I said you stood there Jane with thirteen pound ain't you, in an envelope?
She said yeah ain't it good?
I said I think that's wonderful I said cos do you know how long I've been out the union now, three months, well I reckon I've saved thirty pounds, you've got thirteen quid back
so you've really lost twenty odd quid Jane haven't you really?
No, she could 
she couldn't, she ain't got the mentality to
No, she
with Lynnette hasn't she?
Oh yeah yeah, no
over that woman's feet, cos you know what she did, she rang up Lynnette, she got through to the wrong extension Debbie  answered, she slammed the phone down, and Debbie  knew it were her she went mad
Who, knew it were who?
Lynnette 
And Debbie 
Deb, Deb rang back on reception and said there's been a call, they got cut off, so she said oh that was Lynnette  so Debbie  said
and put the phone down and she rung straight over onto Jan's extension and asked to speak to Maureen and Jan, so Debbie  got a snip of it cos Judith refused, she said rude cow, she said she needn't have slammed the phone down she could have at least said hello so they had her dinner time said Jan was that Lynnette on the phone?
So she said yes, she was cocky weren't she Jan?
Yeah
So she said I think that was damn rude she said she's just slammed the phone down on Deborah and there's really no need for that, well she said it's private between me and Debbie, then we found out she got her a job
Yeah
and she'd offered it to Maureen three months before and Maureen turned it down, and they went mad they said you little creep Jan, little bloody sneak
Yeah, but they were all like that, they'd all stab you in the back.
I tell you, you, the bitchiness in there when everybody went berserk was terrible, it made me laugh 
 
cos I never entertain none of them, I'd just used to sit there and laugh, I never spoke to David from the day everybody left.
I know me and Jenny had a do erm, when I went on post cash, you know when Janet was there?
Yeah
Er, not Janet , Janet for Barbara's friend pretty Janet with the toner 
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah 
and also you know when Janet's doing a stint because you can see if Barbara's smokes well me and Jenny had a do that week and then you, it were my birthday on the Wednesday weren't it?
Mm
And we left on the Friday
That's right
and, and Jan, Jan 
I was on holiday weren't I?
I was at Newcastle
No I think you were there
cos when I come back you'd all gone
That's right, that's right
Yeah
cos there were only you and Marion weren't there and we knew somebody else would be kicked out .
That's right, yeah, that's right I remember posting your card from Yarmouth I think it was.
Well you know where Penny's old desk were, where she sat looking up towards the, and Jenny sat there and Joan sat there, this Janet was sitting there and on that Friday morning when the phone had rung, well I got up and I went to go upstairs to take something or a fax coming for me or something, and as I went past Lynnette hit me on my shoulder and she said it's me Pat, Pat she said it's me, oh Pat I said what's, what's going on?
So of course I never thought no more, went upstairs and got me fax and on the way back Ann  was coming downstairs, I said what's going on Ann?
She said it's a big, big cut off, if your phone rings you're out, so of course the phone were ringing, then it went to one in post, no it never, it went first from Ann from Lynnette then to Ann  and then it went to Kathy and then it went to erm  somebody else and then it come to me but I've got seven hundred thousand pounds worth of money on my desk that I were banking and Jane had got that job and Jane was on post in cash cos she ain't got a job cos that thing with them shoes didn't take off and do you know
Well I've never know anyone like that.
Jenny said erm, this time it said I couldn't stand, when we all come out at twelve o'clock and the shock had hit us and we sort of said oh well we're better off out of it, I'll, I've survived twenty five years without, I shall survive again, and when Jan, and Janet was so sick and then I turn round and Janet says I'm with you girl, I said where you going?
She said I just went in there and she said I couldn't stand any more, she said do you know Joy she said you're one of the nicest people I know, she said I tell you what I've never heard in my life two people stab somebody like you're being stabbed, she says I couldn't sit there any more 
That's right, that's right 
so she said I, I went in and I said to Geraldine I'm going I owe you any bloody money take the bugger out me wages, she says I ain't having people that I like being stabbed like that by people like that, she said she ain't worth the salt of the earth, she's the salt of the earth she said with people like that pointing to Jenny and Jane, no way, she said and I'm going with my mates, I turned round and the next thing Janet and Janet and Barbara in there, when we got up the pub at twelve o'clock, course we were all having sandwiches me and Pam got the, me and er Barb got there, then Pam come in then a few more come and erm then the plumber and all that come in with them and I said oh girls we never clocked out, so I said oh well I'm gonna have to take my key back to Steve , burst out laughing, so I said oh no I said why don't we have a key cracking competition so of course that's what we did we all took our keys out of our bag and we went ready  for she's a jolly good  ready, steady,fellow, for she's  go and we cracked these ruddy keys and shoved them up in the air
Oh
Dave  face, ee, it was evil, and she said 
Can imagine 
guess, her, her punchline, those keys are fifty pence each
No
She did, I'd never forget it as long as I live, I thought to myself well you stupid cow, all she could think of was a fifty pence key, so I, I said to them, I said to the girls I'm glad to be out but of course when they all went cos there was Lynda  and all the girls from customer service that were kicked out and all of us that were there and they all said oh we've gotta go back to work and we said oh ain't that a shame you know, and we all went 
 
back to work and they all went

She said and he picked them up and put them both together and it was seven hundred and odd she had to pay out, for her car!
Bloody hell!
