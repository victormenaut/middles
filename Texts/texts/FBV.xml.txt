[COURT OF APPEAL]DERBYSHIRE COUNTY COUNCIL v. TIMES NEWSPAPERS LTD. and Others 1992 Jan. 20, 21, 22, 23;
Feb. 19
Balcombe, Ralph Gibson and
Butler-Sloss L.JJ.
Defamation — Parties — Corporation — Publication relating to administration of local authority's superannuation fund — Publication insinuating maladministration of pension funds — Balance between public interest in freedom of speech and protection of authority's reputation — Whether entitled to maintain action in respect of governmental and administrative function — Local Government Act 1972 (c. 70), s. 222(1)
The plaintiff, a local authority, brought an action for damages for libel against the defendants in respect of certain newspaper articles which made allegations in relation to share dealings involving the investment of moneys from the local authority's superannuation fund, sometimes by a complex series of deals, in companies connected with or controlled by a businessman.
It was alleged in the articles that the leader of the council had been a prime mover in the share dealings.
The leader and the businessman also brought actions for damages for libel.
The defendants applied to strike out the statement of claim of the local authority on a preliminary issue on the grounds that the authority could not maintain an action in libel for words which reflected on it in relation to its governmental and administrative functions and that the statement of claim disclosed no cause of action.
On the preliminary issue the judge dismissed the application holding that a local authority could sue for libel in respect of its governing or administrative reputation even though no financial loss was pleaded or alleged, that where a local authority instituted proceedings in reliance on section 222(1) of the Local Government Act 1972 it was for the local authority to decide on the expediency of litigating and it was not the court's function to do so on an application to strike out, and that since the words complained of reflected on the local authority itself in the management and rectitude of its financial affairs, the statement of claim did disclose a cause of action against the defendants.
On appeal by the defendants:—
Held , allowing the appeal, that, notwithstanding the general principle that a trading or non-trading corporation was entitled to sue in libel to protect so much of its corporate reputation, as distinct from that of its members, as was capable of being damaged by a defamatory statement, a local authority, as a corporate public authority, was not entitled at common law to sue for libel to protect its governing reputation; that to allow it to do so would impose a substantial and unjustifiable restriction on freedom of expression, since an action for malicious falsehood, or a prosecution for criminal libel, provided the local authority with the sufficient and necessary protection it required in a democratic society; and that, therefore, the local authority could not maintain its libel action for any words which reflected on it as the county council for Derbyshire in relation to its governmental and administrative functions in that county (post, pp. 41H, 48F–G, H — 49B, 56B–C, 58A–B, 59F–G, 65B–C, F).
Dicta of Lord Goff of Chieveley in Attorney-General v. Guardian Newspapers Ltd.
(No. 2)[1990]1 A.C. 109, 283–284, H.L. (E.) and Lord Ackner in Reg. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, Ex parte Brind [1991]1 A.C. 696, 761, H.L. (E.) applied.
Bognor Regis Urban District Council v. Campion [1972]2 Q.B.169 overruled.
Manchester Corporation v. Williams [1891]1 Q.B.94, D.C. disapproved.
Per curiam .
Under section 222 it is for the local authority to consider the expediency of the litigation.
It is not a judge's function on an application to strike out (post, pp. 49D–E, 58B, 65F).
Per Ralph Gibson and Butler-Sloss L.JJ.
Were the local authority to be able to sue in libel in respect of the same matters complained of by an individual councillor this would create duplication of proceedings and increased costs (post, pp. 56E, 65A).
Decision of Morland J. [1991]4 All E.R.
795 reversed.

Appeal from Morland J.
By a writ dated 11 October 1989 the plaintiff, Derbyshire County Council, claimed (1) damages for libel contained in articles appearing in the issue of ‘The Sunday Times’ dated 17 September 1989 entitled ‘Revealed; Socialist tycoon's deals with a Labour chief’and ‘Bizarre deals of a council leader and the media tycoon’, and in the issue dated 24 September 1989 entitled ‘Council share deals under scrutiny’published by the defendants, Times Newspapers Ltd., Andrew Neil, the editor, Rosemary Collins and Peter Hounam, two of the newspaper's journalists; and (2) an injunction to restrain the defendants, their servants or agents from publishing the same or any similar libel of the plaintiff council.
By their statement of claim the council claimed, inter alia,(i) that the council was the county council for Derbyshire and pursuant to statute was responsible for a wide range of governmental and administrative functions in Derbyshire, and in particular the investment and control of the superannuation fund;(ii) that in those issues of ‘The Sunday Times’ the third and fourth defendants falsely and maliciously wrote and the first and second defendants falsely and maliciously printed and published, or caused to be written, printed or published of and concerning the council and of and concerning the council in the way of its discharge of its responsibility for the investment and control of the superannuation fund;(iii) by reason of the words published in the articles the council had been injured in its credit and reputation and had been brought into public scandal, odium and contempt, and had suffered loss and damage.
By order of Master Miller dated 2 November 1990 the following point of law was ordered to be tried as a preliminary point before the trial of the action, namely whether the council could maintain an action for libel for any words which reflected upon the council as the county council for Derbyshire in relation to its governmental and administrative functions in Derbyshire, including its statutory responsibility for the investment and control of the superannuation fund, and whether, if not, the statement of claim disclosed a cause of action.
The trial of the preliminary issue was heard by Morland J. who on 15 March 1991 gave judgment for the council, holding that a local authority could sue for libel in respect of its governing or administrative reputation when no actual damage was alleged, and that the council had a cause of action in libel against the defendants on the basis of the pleaded statement of claim.
The following excerpt from the articles was cited by Morland J. as an example of the allegations as they might affect the reputation of the council and might be defamatory:
‘The fund's external investment advisers, Geoffrey Morley and Partners, have confirmed that although they were told of the scheme, they were not asked to give advice, contrary to a written assurance to a councillor by Reg Beard, the council treasurer, that they had been consulted.
The deals could be ultra vires…
The outcome of this extraordinary deal was that Derbyshire's pension fund had made Oyston [the media tycoon]richer on paper by as much as £1m.
Because the transaction was carried out in this way, the loser was Derbyshire's pension fund.
As with the Telemags transaction, the only advice taken by Derbyshire before making the £2m. investment was from its own financial advisers…’
‘Questionable share deals involving the Miss World group and the pension funds of a county council are being investigated by the Stock Exchange and the City's Takeover Panel after their disclosure by ‘The Sunday Times’ Insight team.
The inquiries will focus on a suspicious series of share transactions by Derbyshire County Council prior to the bitterly contested takeover by the Miss World group of Piccadilly Radio in Manchester earlier this year…
Such inquiries would determine whether a false market in Miss World shares was created before and during a takeover.
In a shares-for-shares takeover, the likely result would be to strengthen the hand of the bidder at the expense of its ‘victim’…
Insight's new share revelations come after evidence of improper behaviour and legally doubtful financial transactions between Oyston and Derbyshire.
Last week Insight revealed that some of Derbyshire's earlier associations with Oyston, including a plan to build a holiday resort behind the Iron Curtain, could be ultra vires, or outside the council's legal scope.
After a series of share transactions following a failed investment of £305,000 in the ‘News on Sunday’ newspaper, Oyston benefited on paper by as much as £1m. from investments by Derbyshire's pension fund.
By a notice of appeal dated 22 March 1991 the defendants appealed on the grounds, inter alia, that the judge erred (1) in following the decision of Browne J. in Bognor Regis Urban District Council v. Campion [1972]2 Q.B.169 even though he was rightly unable to accept the basis on which Browne J. had distinguished the decision of the Divisional Court in Manchester Corporation v. Williams [1891]1 Q.B.94;(2) in holding that Metropolitan Saloon Omnibus Co.
Ltd. v. Hawkins (1859) 4 H. & N. 87 was authority for the proposition that it was an ordinary incident of all corporations (including municipal corporations) that they might sue for libel; that case was only authority for the proposition that a trading company might sue for libel by which its property was injured;(3) in holding that the Manchester Corporation case was decided per incuriam when there was no basis for so holding and he should have followed it;(4) in holding that in bringing an action for libel not alleged to have caused actual damage, no valid distinction could be made between trading corporations and municipal corporations, which ignored the true basis on which a trading corporation was permitted to sue for libel, namely that it had a trading character, the defamation of which might ruin it:South Hetton Coal Co. Ltd. v. North-Eastern News Association Ltd. [1894]1 Q.B.133, 145.
Such a defamation might cause injury to the business goodwill of the corporation, and ultimately loss to the company's shareholders through a diminution in turnover and/or profits.
By contrast a municipal corporation was a public governmental authority with administrative duties owed to all the inhabitants of its area.
It had no business goodwill and was not permitted to trade; nor did it have shareholders;(5) in failing to take proper account of the fact that it logically followed that if a local government corporation could sue for libel in respect of its governing reputation then so too could any institution of central government (including, for example, a government department which was a statutory corporation such as the Department of the Environment);(6) in the premises in considering that there was no uncertainty or ambiguity in English law in relation to the extent to which local authorities might sue for libel.
The judge was therefore at fault in considering that there was no need for him to pay explicit regard to the public interest in freedom of expression guaranteed by article 10 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (1953)(Cmd. 8969) in seeking to resolve the uncertainty or ambiguity in the common law;(7) in failing, as did Browne J. in the Bognor Regis case, to have proper regard to the public interest in freedom of expression and to the question of whether in a democratic society there really was a pressing social need to extend the ambit of the law of defamation to enable a governmental body to sue in respect of presumed (and not actual) injury to its governmental reputation;(8) in failing to take into account the acceptance by the English courts of the fact that where a governmental plaintiff sought to invoke a private law right to interfere with freedom of discussion about the workings of government, the court's approach would (because of the competing public interests involved) differ from that in a private dispute between citizen and citizen.
It was an essential element of the cause of action in such circumstances that the governmental plaintiff establish that the public interest would suffer detriment in the absence of a remedy;(9) in failing to have proper regard to the legislative purpose of section 222(1) of the Local Government Act 1972 by which Parliament could not have intended to authorise a local authority to bring libel proceedings, a fortiori where it had suffered no actual financial loss;(10) having regard to the scale of costs likely to be incurred it could never be in the interests of the inhabitants of the area for the local authority to mount an action for libel in such circumstances, and certainly was not in their interests in the present case where no injury was alleged to the superannuation fund.
The facts are stated in the judgment of Balcombe L.J.
Anthony Lester Q.C.
and Desmond Browne Q.C.
for the defendants.
Alan Newman Q.C.
and Antony White for the council.
19 February.
The following judgments were handed down.
Balcombe L.J.
This appeal with leave of the judge, from a judgment of Morland J. given on 15 March 1991, raises for the first time in the Court of Appeal the question whether a local authority which is a body corporate can sue for libel under the law of England and Wales.
That puts the matter in its widest terms: the precise terms of the preliminary point of law upon which the judge made his ruling were:
‘whether the plaintiff…can maintain an action for libel for any words which reflects [sic]upon the said plaintiff as the county council for Derbyshire in relation to its governmental and administrative functions in Derbyshire, including its statutory responsibility for the investment and control of the superannuation fund…
The preliminary point continues: ‘and whether, if not, the statement of claim…discloses a cause of action.’
The judge treated this as a separate question concerned with the ambit of section 222(1) of the Local Government Act 1972; we followed the same course, even though this would seem to require that the question be phrased ‘and whether, if so, the statement of claim discloses…’
The facts in the case are fortunately refreshingly simple.
In two issues of ‘The Sunday Times’ newspaper on 17 and 24 September 1989 there appeared articles concerning share deals involving the superannuation fund of the Derbyshire County Council.
The articles in the issue of 17 September were headed ‘Revealed: Socialist tycoon's deals with a Labour chief’ and ‘Bizarre deals of a council leader and the media tycoon’: that in the issue of 24 September was headed ‘Council share deals under scrutiny.’
The council leader was Mr. David Melvyn Bookbinder; the ‘media tycoon’ was Mr. Owen Oyston.
It is unnecessary for the purposes of this judgment to set out in any detail the content of these articles: it is sufficient to say that they question the propriety of certain investments made by the council of moneys in its superannuation fund, with Mr. Bookbinder as the prime mover, in three deals with Mr. Oyston or companies controlled by him.
Excerpts from the articles giving the flavour of the allegations made will be found in the judgment at first instance [1991]4 All E.R.
795 (see ante p. 32D–H) to which those interested may refer.
The council is the ‘administering authority’ of its superannuation fund under the Superannuation Act 1972 and the Local Government Superannuation Regulations 1986 (S.I.
1986 No. 24) made thereunder.
In due course the council, Mr. Bookbinder and Mr. Oyston all brought actions for defamation in respect of those articles.
We were told that Mr. Oyston's action was settled on 7 October 1991 following a statement in open court, by an apology made to Mr. Oyston and the payment of damages and costs.
The actions by the council and Mr. Bookbinder (which are to be tried one immediately after the other, or concurrently, before the same tribunal) are stayed pending the outcome of this appeal.
The statements of claim in the actions by the council and Mr. Bookbinder are in terms which are, as near as may be, identical.
The defendants are in each case Times Newspapers Ltd., the publisher and proprietor of ‘The Sunday Times,’ the editor of ‘The Sunday Times,’and the two journalists who wrote the articles of which complaint is made.
Paragraph 6 of the council's statement of claim asserts that in the issue of ‘The Sunday Times’ for 17 September the third and fourth defendants wrote, and the first and second defendants published:
‘of and…concerning the council and of and concerning the council in the way of its discharge of its responsibility for the investment and control of the superannuation fund the following words…
and then follow the words of which complaint is made.
Paragraph 8 of the council's statement of claim makes a similar assertion in relation to the article of 24 September.
Then the second paragraph 9 of the council's statement of claim is in these terms:
‘By reason of the words published on 17 September 1989 and the words and graph published on 24 September 1989 the plaintiff council has been injured in its credit and reputation and has been brought into public scandal, odium and contempt, and has suffered loss and damage.
It will be noted that no special damage is pleaded.
An application by the council to amend its statement of claim so as to plead special damage was refused by French J. on 31 July 1991.
The argument before the judge on the first question, whether a local authority can sue for libel in respect of its governing or administrative reputation when no actual financial loss is alleged, proceeded under two main heads.
(1) Whether, apart from arguments based on the right to freedom of expression, a non-trading corporation has a sufficient reputation to sustain an action for libel even though it can establish no actual financial loss.
The judge answered this question unequivocally in the affirmative sense.
(2) Whether the right to free speech, whether as a right at common law, or under article 10 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (1953)(Cmd. 8969), led to a different result in the case of a non-trading corporation which was also a public authority.
The Convention was ratified by the United Kingdom on 8 March 1951; article 19 of the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (1977)(Cmnd. 6702), which was ratified by the United Kingdom with effect from 20 August 1976, is to the like effect.
The judge gave short shrift to an argument based on the right to free speech, and held that it did not affect his primary conclusion as stated above.
He answered the second question, which he considered as turning on the effect of section 222(1) of the Local Government Act 1972, by concluding that the council had a cause of action in libel against the defendants on the basis of the pleaded statement of claim.
From this judgment the defendants have appealed.
The arguments before us ranged far and wide, as they did before the judge, but in the end they resolved into the following issues which I propose to consider seriatim. (1) Can a non-trading corporation sue for libel in respect of its governing or administrative reputation when no actual financial loss is pleaded or established?(2) Does the right to freedom of expression affect the position where the non-trading corporation is also a public authority?(3) Does the operation of section 222(1) of the Local Government Act 1972, or any other matter contained in or omitted from the council's statement of claim, preclude the council from continuing with this action?
(1) The right of a non-trading corporation to sue for libel
I start, as did the judge, with the proposition that the raison d'ëtre of the tort of defamation is the protection of the reputation of a person.
Where the person is a living human person no particular problem arises, but sometimes the personality is a legal fiction, as in the case of a corporation.
Does such a fictitious person have a reputation which it can protect by the law of defamation?
It seems never to have been doubted that a corporation created by Royal Charter can sue for libel.
Thus in Metropolitan Saloon Omnibus Co.
Ltd. v. Hawkins (1859) 4 H. & N. 87, 90, Pollock C.B. said:
‘That a corporation at common law can sue in respect of a libel there is no doubt.
It would be monstrous if a corporation could maintain no action for slander of title through which they lost a great deal of money.
It could not sue in respect of an imputation of murder, or incest, or adultery, because it could not commit those crimes.
Nor could it sue in respect of a charge of corruption, for a corporation cannot be guilty of corruption, although the individuals composing it may.
But it would be very odd if a corporation had no means of protecting itself against wrong; and if its property is injured by slander it has no means of redress except by action.
Therefore it appears to me clear that a corporation at common law may maintain an action for a libel by which its property is injured.
The Metropolitan Saloon Omnibus case concerned the right of a trading company incorporated under the Joint Stock Companies Act 1856 (19 & 20 Vict. c. 47) to sue for libel.
The court was unanimous in holding that it had such a right.
The argument of counsel to the contrary effect and, indeed, some of the judgments — e.g. the reference by Pollock C.B., at p. 91, to the plaintiff as a ‘quasi-corporation’— seem to reflect a confusion of thought about identifying the company with its members that was not finally laid to rest until the decision of the House of Lords in Salomon v. Salomon and Co.
Ltd. [1897]A.C. 22.
Nevertheless each member of the court held that the company could sue to protect its trading reputation.
Thus Pollock C.B. said, at pp. 90–91:
‘But in order to carry on business it is necessary that the reputation of such a corporation should be protected, and therefore in the case of libel or slander it must have a remedy by action.
Martin B. said, at p. 92:
‘As my Lord said, there may be particular kinds of libel which cannot affect a corporation, but in respect of such libels as are injurious to it an action may be maintained.
Then is it any answer that the libeller is a member of the corporate body?
Watson B. said, at p. 93:
‘One of the safeguards to individuals against libel is the remedy by action; and I cannot conceive a proposition more dangerous than this, that because a company is incorporated they have no appeal to a court of justice if they are libelled.
The assertion by Pollock C.B. quoted above that a corporation could not sue for libel in respect of a charge of corruption, because a corporation cannot be guilty of corruption, appears to have been the foundation for the decision by a Divisional Court in Manchester Corporation v. Williams [1891]1 Q.B.94, but more fully reported in 63 L.T. 805.
The Divisional Court held, on a preliminary point of law, that an action for libel was not maintainable by the municipal corporation of the city of Manchester.
The leading judgment of Day J. makes clear the basis for the decision in the following passage, 63 L.T. 805, 806:
‘This action is brought by the mayor, aldermen, and citizens of the city of Manchester to recover damages from the defendant in respect of that which is alleged by them to be a libel on the corporation.
The alleged libel is contained in a letter written by the defendant to the editor of the ‘Manchester Examiner and Times’, which charged, as alleged by the statement of claim, that bribery and corruption existed or had existed in three departments of the Manchester City Council, and that the plaintiffs were either parties thereto or culpably ignorant thereof, and that the said bribery and corruption prevailed to such an extent as to render necessary an inquiry by a parliamentary commission.
Now it is for us to determine whether a corporation can bring such an action, and I must say that, to my mind, to allow such a thing would be wholly unprecedented and contrary to principle.
A corporation may sue for a libel affecting property, not for one merely affecting personal reputation.
This does not fall within the class of cases in respect of which a corporation can maintain an action, but does fall within the second class commented on by Pollock C.B. in his judgment in the case of the Metropolitan Saloon Omnibus Co.
Ltd. v. Hawkins , 4 H. & N. 87, with which I fully agree…
There then follows the passage from the judgment of Pollock C.B. which I have cited above.
The judgment of Day J. ends, at p. 807:
‘The charge in the present case is one of bribery and corruption, of which a corporation cannot possibly be guilty, and therefore, in my opinion, this action will not lie.
Lawrance J. was of the same opinion and for the same reasons.
Morland J. accepted the submission of Mr. Newman for the council that the Manchester Corporation case was decided per incuriam, in that it was theoretically possible for a local authority to be guilty of corruption under sections 1 and 7 of the Public Bodies Corrupt Practices Act 1889 (52 & 53 Vict. c. 69).
Mr. Lester, for the defendants, sought to persuade us that a local authority could not be guilty of the crime of corruption and that the Manchester Corporation case was correctly decided.
I do not find it necessary to reach any conclusion on the question whether a local authority can be guilty of corruption.
The decision of the Divisional Court in the Manchester Corporation case is not binding on this court and, although it may in the event have reached a conclusion with which I would now agree, I find the reasoning by which that conclusion was reached wholly unconvincing.
Like Browne J. in Bognor Regis Urban District Council v. Campion [1972]2 Q.B.169, 177, I find the criticism of the Manchester Corporation case by Spencer Bower, Actionable Defamation , 1st ed. (1908) convincing.
The author said, at pp. 278–279:
‘It is obvious that ‘reputation,’ in the sense in which alone it concerns the subject of defamation, has relation to the particular person enjoying it.
But it must not be forgotten that ‘person’ for this purpose includes an artificial person: that is to say, it includes both ‘a body of persons,’and a firm…
That a commercial ‘body of persons’ has a ‘trading character,’and can sue in respect of a publication tending to injure that trading character, is now clearly established…
But it is submitted that a ‘body of persons’ has a collective character independently of the question whether it is a mercantile body or not, which the law is bound to protect; in other words that any such body can sue in respect of an imputation of any conduct whatsoever of which its agents, and therefore itself by its agents , can be guilty.
At present the authorities have not gone so far as this.
Indeed, there is one dictum and one decision (not, however, of the Court of Appeal) which are against any such comprehensive proposition.
I venture to think that both the dictum and the decision are wrong, and that, as soon as they come under review by the Court of Appeal, will be declared to be so.
Then later in a direct reference to the Manchester Corporation case he said, at p. 280:
‘The case is about as unsatisfactory a one as can be imagined.
No real thought seems to have been bestowed on the important principle involved either by Day J., who…appears to found his decision simply on the above dictum of Pollock C.B., which happens to mention corruption, as one of the inapposite illustrations of an unsound proposition, or by Lawrance J., who contents himself with a bare expression of concurrence.
It is submitted that the judgment cannot be supported on principle, though, as regards the particular application of the principle, but no further, it must be taken to be law in any court of first instance.
The next case is South Hetton Coal Co. Ltd. v. North-Eastern News Association Ltd. [1894]1 Q.B. 133, a decision of the Court of Appeal.
The headnote accurately states the effect of the decision:
‘An action of libel will lie at the suit of an incorporated trading company in respect of a libel calculated to injure its reputation in the way of its business, without proof of special damage.
The relevance of this case in the present context depends on the statements of principle contained in the judgments which, being in the Court of Appeal, are binding upon us.
Lord Esher M.R. said, at pp. 138–139:
‘…
I have come to the conclusion that the law of libel is one and the same as to all plaintiffs; and that, in every action of libel, whether the statement complained of is, or is not, a libel, depends on the same question — viz., whether the jury are of opinion that what has been published with regard to the plaintiff would tend in the minds of people of ordinary sense to bring the plaintiff into contempt, hatred, or ridicule, or to injure his character.
The question is really the same by whomsoever the action is brought — whether by a person, a firm, or a company.
But though the law is the same, the application of it is, no doubt, different with regard to different kinds of plaintiffs.
There are statements which, with regard to some plaintiffs, would undoubtedly constitute a libel, but which, if published of another kind of plaintiffs, would not have the same effect.
…Therefore, although the law is the same with regard to libel on a firm or company as with regard to libel on a person, the conditions under which the particular statement can be libellous may not exist with regard to them.
…With regard to a firm or a company, it is impossible to lay down an exhaustive rule as to what would be a libel on them.
But the same rule is applicable to a statement made with regard to them.
Statements may be made with regard to their mode of carrying on business, such as to lead people of ordinary sense to the opinion that they conduct their business badly and inefficiently.
If so, the law will be the same in their case as in that of an individual, and the statement will be libellous.
Then, if the case be one of libel — whether on a person, a firm, or a company — the law is that the damages are at large.
It is not necessary to prove any particular damage; the jury may give such damages as they think fit, having regard to the conduct of the parties respectively, and all the circumstances of the case.
Lopes L.J.
gave a judgment to the like effect, although he limited his remarks to the ability of a corporation to sue for a libel reflecting on the management of its trade or business.
He too repeated the assertion that a corporation could not sue for libel in respect of a charge of corruption because it cannot be guilty of corruption, but this assertion was unnecessary for his decision in the case and was obiter.
Kay L.J.
also concurred in the result.
After referring to the ability of partners to sue for a libel on their firm he said, at pp. 145, 146–147, 148:
‘The same law is applicable to a certain extent to a trading corporation.
Its property or its business may be injured by defamatory statements whether written or oral.
It has a trading character, the defamation of which may ruin it.
…Then it is suggested that, although an individual can sue for a libel upon him in relation to his business, or even the members of a partnership may maintain a joint action for such a libel, yet that an incorporated company cannot.
But why not?
Such a corporation has a trading character, which may be destroyed by libel.
If an individual or the members of a firm may sue for a libel imputing to them insolvency, because of the damage which such a libel is calculated to do them in relation to their business, could it possibly be maintained that a trading corporation could not sue for a like libel?…
I therefore am of opinion that a trading corporation may sue for a libel calculated to injure them in respect of their business, and may do so without any proof of damage general or special.
Of course if there be no such evidence the damages given will probably be small.
In National Union of General and Municipal Workers v. Gillian [1946]K.B.
81 the Court of Appeal, affirming the decision of Birkett J. at first instance, held that a trade union, having at that time a legal personality recognised by the law, could sue in defamation.
For present purposes the judgment of Uthwatt J. in the Court of Appeal is most relevant when he said, at p. 88:
‘It is well established that in certain cases a trading corporation may bring a suit in respect of an imputation on its trading reputation, and I see no reason why a non-trading corporation should not have the same rights as respects imputations on the conduct by it of its activities.
A trade union to my mind stands in the same position.
It, too, has its reputation.
Why should it not be protected?
The decision in Gillian has now been overruled by statute: see section 2(1) of the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1974;Electrical, Electronic, Telecommunication and Plumbing Union v. Times Newspapers Ltd. [1980]Q.B. 585; but that in no way detracts from the persuasive force of what was said by Uthwatt J. in Gillian .
Bognor Regis Urban District Council v. Campion [1972]2 Q.B.169 raised the direct question whether a local authority could sue in libel.
Browne J. reviewed the authorities and followed the principles set out in Gillian .
He said, at p. 175:
‘Just as a trading company has a trading reputation which it is entitled to protect by bringing an action for defamation, so in my view the plaintiffs as a local government corporation have a ‘governing’ reputation which they are equally entitled to protect in the same way — of course, bearing in mind the vital distinction between defamation of the corporation as such and defamation of its individual officers or members.
He found himself able to distinguish the Manchester Corporation case [1891]1 Q.B.94, by which he was technically bound, on grounds which I have to say I find unconvincing, as did Morland J. Browne J. said, at p. 178:
‘The actual decision in the Manchester Corporation case can perhaps be supported, as Mr. Waterhouse suggested, on the argument that the libel there was not capable of referring to a corporation consisting (as the plaintiffs did) of the mayor, aldermen and citizens , and not, as here, of the chairman and councillors.
I think that that case is distinguishable from this on that ground, and also on the ground that in my view none of the statements in the leaflet in this case actually impute corruption.
But I hope that the Court of Appeal will soon have occasion to consider the Manchester Corporation case.
It is to be observed that in the Bognor Regis case Browne J. did not consider whether his decision had any effect on the right to freedom of expression, doubtless because the point was not taken before him by the defendant, who appeared in person.
This was one ground upon which Mr. J. A. Weir in an article, ‘Local Authority v. Critical Ratepayer — A suit in Defamation,’[1972A]C.L.J. 238 attacked the decision in strong, if not intemperate, terms.
He also criticised the decision of the Court of Appeal in the South Hetton Coal Co. case [1894]1 Q.B.133, by which we are bound, and with which in any event I agree.
But in so far as his criticism is based on the right to freedom of expression and its particular relevance where a local or central government authority is concerned, I consider that aspect in the next section of this judgment.
A more moderate criticism of the Bognor Regis case, but raising similar points, is to be found in an article, ‘More Bother in Bognor,’ by J. K. Gatenby in (1973) 36 M.L.R. 307.
The Bognor Regis case, and Mr. Weir's criticism of it, was also considered by the Faulks Committee: Report of the Committee on Defamation (1975)(Cmnd. 5909) who in their report took the view that the Bognor Regis case was ‘rightly decided in accordance with the present law:’ see p. 90, para. 334.
The Bognor Regis case has been followed in other common law jurisdictions.
In City of Prince George v. British Columbia Television System Ltd. (1978) 85 D.L.R. (3d) 755 the Bognor Regis case was followed and the Manchester Corporation case distinguished both by Toy J. at first instance in the British Columbia Supreme Court and by the British Columbia Court of Appeal (1979) 95 D.L.R. (3d) 577.
The reasoning of Aikins J.A.
is contained in the following passage from his judgment, at p. 582:
‘In my opinion, it is beyond question that municipal corporations have reputations.
A cursory examination of the Municipal Act reveals the great diversity of matters in respect of which municipalities may legislate and the diversity of activities in which such corporations may engage.
The way in which a municipality legislates and the way in which it administers the legislation it enacts and conducts itself in relation to activities which it lawfully undertakes cannot but create a municipal reputation, be it good, bad or indifferent.
I can see no basis in principle for holding that a municipal corporation, empowered by statute to sue in its corporate name, cannot maintain an action for libel.
To hold otherwise would leave municipalities the helpless victims of all those who choose to publish untrue imputations which injure their reputations.
He also considered an argument based on freedom of speech, but rejected it for reasons which I consider in the next section of this judgment.
In Church of Scientology Inc. v. Anderson [1980]W.A.R.
71 Brinsden J. in the Supreme Court of Western Australia also followed the Bognor Regis case in an action for libel by a non-trading corporation with a ‘religious’ reputation.
In my judgment the principle established by the authorities to which I have referred (other than the Manchester Corporation case [1891]1 Q.B.94) is that any corporation, whether trading or non-trading, which can show that it has a corporate reputation (as distinct from that of its members) which is capable of being damaged by a defamatory statement, can sue in libel to protect that reputation, in the same way as can a natural person, although there will of course be certain types of statement which cannot defame an artificial person.
This principle seems to me to be in accordance with good sense.
Even a non-trading corporation may need to engage in various activities in pursuance of its objects.
Thus it may need to borrow money, and its ability to do so may potentially be affected by an attack on its creditworthiness.
Or it may need to employ staff, and a statement that it engages in discriminatory employment practices may potentially affect its ability to attract staff of the right calibre.
These are only two examples of cases where it should be possible for a non-trading corporation, which asserts that its reputation is capable of being damaged by the defamatory statement, to sue for libel.
In so far as the Manchester Corporation case is inconsistent with the principle to which I have referred it is wrong and is not good law.
(2) The right to freedom of expression
Article 10 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (1953) is, so far as relevant, in the following terms:
‘1.
Everyone has the right to freedom of expression.
This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers.…
2.
The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society…for the protection of the reputation or rights of others…
Article 19 of the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (1977) is, again so far as relevant, in the following terms:
‘1.
Everyone shall have the right to hold opinions without interference.
2.
Everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds…3.
The exercise of the rights provided for in paragraph 2 of this article carries with it special duties and responsibilities.
It may therefore be subject to certain restrictions, but these shall only be such as are provided by law and are necessary:(a ) For respect of the rights or reputations of others;…
Although all the reported decisions refer to article 10, I conceive that the same arguments mutatis mutandis must apply to article 19.
For the sake of convenience future references to article 10 in this judgment should be deemed to include reference also to article 19.
It has been stated on high authority that article 10 is in effect the same as the English common law.
The passages below, taken from the judgment of Sir John Donaldson M.R. in the Court of Appeal, and the speech of Lord Goff of Chieveley in the House of Lords in Attorney-General v. Guardian Newspapers Ltd.
(No. 2)[1990]1 A.C. 109 (one of the many Spycatcher cases), although referring to a common law (or more strictly equitable) action to protect a right of confidentiality, must also apply to the common law action of defamation to protect reputation.
Sir John Donaldson M.R. said, at p. 178:
‘The starting point of our domestic law is that every citizen has a right to do what he likes, unless restrained by the common law, including the law of contract, or by statute.
If, therefore, someone wishes to assert a right to confidentiality, the initial burden of establishing circumstances giving rise to this right lies upon him.
The substantive right to freedom of expression contained in article 10 is subsumed in our domestic law in this universal basic freedom of action.
Thereafter, both under our domestic law and under the Convention, the courts have the power and the duty to assess the ‘pressing social need’ for the maintenance of confidentiality ‘proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued’against the basic right to freedom of expression and all other relevant factors.
In so doing they are free to apply ‘a margin of appreciation’ based upon local knowledge of the needs of the society to which they belong: see The Sunday Times v. United Kingdom (1979) 2 E.H.R.R. 245 and Lingens v. Austria (1986) 8 E.H.R.R. 407.
For my part I can detect no inconsistency between our domestic law and the Convention.
Neither adopts an absolute attitude for or against the maintenance of confidentiality.
Both contemplate a balancing of competing private and public interests.
Lord Goff of Chieveley said, at pp. 283–284:
‘Finally, I wish to observe that I can see no inconsistency between English law on this subject and article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights.
This is scarcely surprising, since we may pride ourselves on the fact that freedom of speech has existed in this country perhaps as long as, if not longer than, it has existed in any other country in the world.
The only difference is that, whereas article 10 of the Convention, in accordance with its avowed purpose, proceeds to state a fundamental right and then to qualify it, we in this country (where everybody is free to do anything, subject only to the provisions of the law) proceed rather upon an assumption of freedom of speech, and turn to our law to discover the established exceptions to it.
In any event I conceive it to be my duty, when I am free to do so, to interpret the law in accordance with the obligations of the Crown under this treaty.
The exercise of the right to freedom of expression under article 10 may be subject to restrictions (as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society) in relation to certain prescribed matters, which include ‘the interests of national security’ and ‘preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence.’
It is established in the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights that the word ‘necessary’ in this context implies the existence of a pressing social need, and that interference with freedom of expression should be no more than is proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued.
I have no reason to believe that English law, as applied in the courts, leads to any different conclusion.
So article 10 does not establish any novel proposition under English law.
Nevertheless, since it states the right to freedom of expression and the qualifications to that right in precise terms, it will be convenient to consider the question by reference to article 10 alone.
Article 10 has not been incorporated into English domestic law.
Nevertheless it may be resorted to in order to help resolve some uncertainty or ambiguity in municipal law:per Lord Ackner in Reg. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, Ex parte Brind [1991]1 A.C. 696, 761.
Thus (1) article 10 may be used for the purpose of the resolution of an ambiguity in English primary or subordinate legislation:Ex parte Brind ,per Lord Bridge of Harwich, at pp. 747–748;per Lord Roskill, at pp. 749–750;per Lord Ackner, at p. 760. (2) Article 10 may be used when considering the principles upon which the court should act in exercising a discretion, e.g. whether or not to grant an interlocutory injunction:per Lord Templeman and Lord Ackner in Attorney-General v. Guardian Newspapers Ltd. [1987]1 W.L.R. 1248, 1296, 1307;In re W. (A Minor)(Wardship: Restrictions on Publication)[1992]1 W.L.R. 100, 103, in the Court of Appeal.
(3) Article 10 may be used when the common law (by which I include the doctrines of equity) is uncertain.
In Attorney-General v. Guardian Newspapers Ltd.
(No. 2)[1990]1 A.C. 109 the courts at all levels had regard to the provisions of article 10 in considering the extent of the duty of confidence.
They did not limit the application of article 10 to the discretion of the court to grant or withhold an injunction to restrain a breach of confidence.
Even if the common law is certain the courts will still, when appropriate, consider whether the United Kingdom is in breach of article 10.
Thus in Reg. v. Chief Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate, Ex parte Choudhury [1991]1 Q.B.429, where the issue was whether the common law offence of blasphemy is restricted to Christianity, Watkins L.J., delivering the judgment of a strong Divisional Court said, at p. 449:
‘[Counsel]accepted that the obligations imposed on the United Kingdom by the Convention are relevant sources of public policy where the common law is uncertain.
But, he maintained, the common law of blasphemy is, without doubt, certain.
Accordingly, it is not necessary to pay any regard to the Convention.
Nevertheless, he thought it necessary, and we agree , in the context of this case, to attempt to satisfy us that the United Kingdom is not in any event in breach of the Convention.’
(My emphasis.)
This approach of English law to article 10 is wholly consistent with the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights.
That court has, on more than one occasion, held that a decision of the English courts has violated a litigant's rights under article 10 and this on occasion has led to Parliament having to change the substantive law.
Thus The Sunday Times v. United Kingdom (1979) 2 E.H.R.R 245 was in part responsible for the Contempt of Court Act 1981.
Of more immediate relevance to the present case the European Court of Human Rights has held in Lingens v. Austria (1986) 8 E.H.R.R. 407 that the prosecution and conviction, under the Austrian law of criminal defamation, of a magazine publisher in Vienna for printing two articles critical of the Austrian Chancellor was a violation of article 10.
In my judgment, therefore, where the law is uncertain, it must be right for the court to approach the issue before it with a predilection to ensure that our law should not involve a breach of article 10.
That was the approach of Lord Oliver of Aylmerton in In re K.D. (A Minor)(Ward: Termination of Access)[1988]A.C. 806 where, in relation to an argument based on articles 6 and 8 of the same Convention and a previous decision of the European Court of Human Rights,R. v. United Kingdom (Case 6/1986/104/152), The Times, 9 July 1987, he cited with approval the argument of counsel in the following passage, at p. 823:
‘Although this is not binding upon your Lordships, the United Kingdom is, of course, a party to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and it is urged that it is at least desirable that the domestic law of the United Kingdom should accord with the decisions of the European Court of Human Rights under the Convention.
Similarly in Reg. v. Wells Street Stipendiary Magistrate, Ex parte Deakin [1980]A.C. 479, a case concerned with the law of criminal libel, both Lord Diplock and Lord Keith of Kinkel were concerned that the result to which they felt constrained to come entailed the risk of a failure to comply with our international obligations under article 10.
In that case the remedy required — that the consent of the Attorney-General be obtained for the institution of any prosecution for criminal libel: see p. 484 — was one which it was outside the power of the court to introduce.
The judge dealt very briefly with this argument.
He accepted Lord Ackner's statement in Ex parte Brind [1991]1 A.C. 696, 761 cited above, but said [1991]4 All E.R.
795, 806: ‘I do not find any uncertainty or ambiguity in relation to the ambit of English law in relation to the extent to which local authorities may sue for libel.’
With all respect to the judge I do not agree with his finding that there was no uncertainty in the English law on this point.
He was faced with two conflicting decisions: one (the Manchester Corporation case [1891]1 Q.B.94) of a Divisional Court which was prima facie binding upon him unless he could find a valid ground on which to distinguish it and one (the Bognor Regis case [1972]2 Q.B.169) by a judge of co-ordinate jurisdiction.
There was no decision of the Court of Appeal or the House of Lords on the point.
The law on this very important point is, in my view, uncertain.
The issue is whether a civil action for defamation lies at the suit of a corporate public authority.
This court is in a position to define the extent of this common law tort in such a way as not to require a positive amendment of the law by Parliament.
In my judgment we both can and should consider the effect of article 10.
This I now proceed to do.
Local Government Act 1972, s. 222(1): see post, p. 49C.
Article 10(1) in terms expresses an absolute right, that of freedom of expression.
That right to freedom of expression includes freedom to impart information and ideas without interference by public authority.
Prima facie that right will be interfered with by a public authority if the maker of the statement is sued for defamation.
In the normal case the interfering public authority is the court which entertains the suit for defamation.
(Here the interference by public authority is twofold since the council, which has initiated the suit, is itself a public authority.)
That an action for defamation is a prima facie interference with the right is recognised by article 10(2) which provides that the exercise of the freedoms referred to in article 10(1) may be subject to such restrictions as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society (my emphasis) for the protection of the reputation of others.
Thus article 10 requires a balancing exercise to be conducted: the balance in this case is between the right to freedom of expression and such restrictions as are necessary in a democratic society for the protection of the reputation of a non-trading corporation which is also a public authority.
Before I consider that balancing exercise in the present case, I remind myself that it is not only local authorities which are public authorities with corporate status.
We were helpfully provided by Mr. Lester with a schedule listing eight examples of government departments with corporate status: they include the Secretaries of State for Defence, Education and Science, Energy, Environment and Social Services.
If the council can sue for libel, then so can those departments.
The law reports, both of this country and of other jurisdictions, contain many statements emphasising the importance of the right, in a democratic society, to be able to criticise freely the conduct of affairs by public authorities.
I cite only a few.
In Hector v. Attorney-General of Antigua and Barbuda [1990]2 A.C. 312 Lord Bridge of Harwich said, at p. 318:
‘In a free democratic society it is almost too obvious to need stating that those who hold office in government and who are responsible for public administration must always be open to criticism.
Any attempt to stifle or fetter such criticism amounts to political censorship of the most insidious and objectionable kind.
In Commonwealth of Australia v. John Fairfax & Sons Ltd. (1980) 147 C.L.R. 39 Mason J. said, at p. 52:
‘It is unacceptable in our democratic society that there should be a restraint on the publication of information relating to government when the only vice of that information is that it enables the public to discuss, review and criticise government action.
This passage is part of a longer passage cited with approval by Lord Keith of Kinkel, Lord Griffiths and Lord Goff of Chieveley in Attorney-General v. Guardian Newspapers Ltd.
(No. 2)[1990]1 A.C. 109, 258, 270 and 283.
In the United States of America it has long been held that a municipal authority cannot sue in the tort of libel.
While this rule depends upon the provisions of the federal and state constitutions, the reasoning has universal application.
In City of Chicago v. Tribune Co. (1923) 139 N.E. 86 Thompson C.J. of the Supreme Court of Illinois in the course of a long judgment, all of which is of great interest, said, at p. 90:
‘The fundamental right of freedom of speech is involved in this litigation, and not merely the right of liberty of the press.
If this action can be maintained against a newspaper it can be maintained against every private citizen who ventures to criticise the ministers who are temporarily conducting the affairs of his government.
Where any person by speech or writing seeks to persuade others to violate existing law or to overthrow by force or other unlawful means the existing government, he may be punished…but all other utterances or publications against the government must be considered absolutely privileged.
While in the early history of the struggle for freedom of speech the restrictions were enforced by criminal prosecutions, it is clear that a civil action is as great, if not a greater, restriction than a criminal prosecution.
If the right to criticise the government is a privilege which, with the exceptions above enumerated, cannot be restricted, then all civil as well as criminal actions are forbidden.
A despotic or corrupt government can more easily stifle opposition by a series of civil actions than by criminal prosecutions…
for which he then gives a number of convincing reasons.
He continues, at pp. 90–91:
‘It follows therefore that every citizen has a right to criticise an inefficient or corrupt government without fear of civil as well as criminal prosecution.
This absolute privilege is founded on the principle that it is advantageous for the public interest that the citizen should not be in any way fettered in his statements, and where the public service or due administration of justice is involved he shall have the right to speak his mind freely…
Municipal corporations, however, exist primarily for governmental purposes, and they are permitted to enter the commercial field solely for the purpose of subserving the interests of the public which they represent.
A city is no less a government because it owns and operates its own water system, its own gas and electric system, and its own transportation system.
…It is manifest that, the more so-called private property the people permit their governments to own and operate, the more important is the right to freely criticise the administration of the government.
As the amount of property owned by the city and the amount of public business to be transacted by the city increase, so does the opportunity for inefficient and corrupt government increase, and the greater will be the efforts of the administration to remain in control of such a political prize.
The richer the city the greater the incentive to stifle opposition.
In so far as the question before us is concerned, no distinction can be made with respect to the proprietary and governmental capacities of a city.
This judgment, which demonstrates the ‘chilling effect’ which the ability to sue for libel may have on the right to criticise a public authority, was cited with approval by Brennan J. delivering the opinion of the United States Supreme Court in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan (1964) 376 U.S. 254, 277.
In City of Prince George v. British Columbia Television System Ltd. , 95 D.L.R. (3d) 577 the argument against allowing a municipal corporation to sue for libel, based on freedom of speech, was rejected by Aikins J.A.
(with whom Craig J.A.
agreed) in the following passage, at pp. 584–585:
‘it is contended that to hold that a municipal corporation may maintain an action for libel would unduly encroach on the right of the public to speak freely concerning municipal affairs.
Counsel suggests that if municipal corporations have the right to sue for libel this right would give municipalities the power to suppress legitimate and proper criticism by threats of legal proceedings.
The short answer to counsel's submission, founded on freedom of speech, is simply that that right, under our law, must be exercised subject to the law of defamation which affords everyone protection against injury to reputation by untrue imputation.
Moreover, as counsel for the respondent pointed out, in my view correctly, the law of defamation makes adequate provision by the principle adopted in respect of fair comment to protect those who make legitimate critical comments on matters of public interest.
In my view the appellant's argument founded on free speech is without merit.
It will be noted that there was here no attempt to carry out the balancing exercise required by article 10 and for that reason alone this decision is of little persuasive authority.
But in any event I have to say that I find the judge's reasons unconvincing and would not be minded to follow them unless we were under an obligation so to do.
If a corporate public authority is unable to sue for libel it is, however, by no means without remedy.
First, and probably of most practical significance, its actions will necessarily be those of its members or officers since, being a legal fiction, it can only act through the instrumentality of human beings.
They, if defamed, will have the right to sue for libel and, in the case of a libel upon the authority's officers acting in the course of their duties, it may be that the authority will subvent their actions.
It is not without significance that in the present case Mr. Bookbinder's action for libel is based upon the same complaints as those made by the council.
Then in an appropriate case the public authority may be able to secure the institution of a prosecution for criminal libel.
Where, as here, the alleged libel has been published in a newspaper, the prosecution may not be commenced without the leave of a judge under section 8 of the Law of Libel Amendment Act 1888 (51 & 52 Vict. c. 64)— a very important safeguard when the freedom of the press is in issue.
Finally, the authority may have an action for malicious (sometimes called ‘injurious’) falsehood.
The distinction between the torts of defamation and malicious falsehood is conveniently summarised in Duncan & Neill on Defamation , 2nd ed. (1983), p. 3, para. 2.03.
The essential differences are (1) the shift in the burden of proof: in defamation the defendant has to prove that the defamatory words were true; in malicious falsehood the plaintiff must prove that the words are false.
(2) In an action for malicious falsehood the plaintiff has to prove malice as part of his cause of action; this is not so in the case of defamation. (3) Damage is not presumed in the case of malicious falsehood as it is in libel.
However, the severity of this rule is mitigated by section 3 of the Defamation Act 1952 which provides that in an action for malicious falsehood it shall not be necessary to allege or prove special damage if the words upon which the action is founded are calculated to cause pecuniary damage to the plaintiff and are published in writing or other permanent form.
Bearing in mind the words of article 10(2), in my judgment the right to sue for malicious falsehood gives to a corporate public authority all such rights as are ‘necessary in a democratic society ,’ i.e. for which there exists a pressing social need, for the protection of its reputation.
It does not need, for that protection, to have the right to sue in defamation and thereby be able to stifle legitimate public criticism of its activities.
Mr. Lester presented us with what he termed a menu of choices in case we should be against his submission that the right to sue in malicious falsehood was a sufficient protection for the reputation of a corporate public authority.
Since I accept his primary submission I do not find it necessary to consider his other options, but I observe that in every case they would involve the court in a far more creative exercise in framing the law, which I doubt we would be entitled to undertake, than by holding as I would do that a corporate public authority has no right to sue for the tort of defamation and is to be left, if necessary, to such other rights as it may have, in particular the right to sue for malicious falsehood.
Accordingly, in my judgment, the right to freedom of expression does affect the position where the non-trading corporation is a public authority.
I would allow this appeal and in answer to the first question raised by the preliminary point of law declare that the council cannot maintain an action for libel for any words which reflect upon it as the county council for Derbyshire in relation to its governmental and administrative functions in Derbyshire, including its statutory responsibility for the investment and control of the superannuation fund.
In the circumstances it is not strictly necessary to answer the second question (i.e. the third issue listed above), but in case this case goes further I will do so briefly.
(3) Section 222(1) of the Local Government Act 1972 and the council's statement of claim
Section 222(1) of the Local Government Act 1972 provides:
‘Where a local authority consider it expedient for the promotion or protection of the interests of the inhabitants of their area —(a ) they may prosecute…any legal proceedings…
The defendants argued that the council's action for libel against them, as set out in the statement of claim, is not capable of promoting or protecting the interests of the inhabitants of Derbyshire.
The judge rejected this argument on two grounds.
(1) It is for the local authority to consider the expediency of the litigation.
It is not a judge's function on an application to strike out.
(2) Any challenge to a local authority's decision to litigate can only be made by way of judicial review.
With the judge's first ground I am in complete agreement.
On the assumption that the council has a reputation which requires protection, in my judgment the statement of claim, particularly in the passages from paragraph 6 and the second paragraph 9 to which I have referred above, adequately pleads a cause of action in defamation.
It cannot be said, merely by looking at the allegations in the statement of claim, which is all that is permissible under the terms of the preliminary point of law, that the council could not have considered the action expedient for the promotion or protection of the interests of the inhabitants of Derbyshire.
I have some hesitation in accepting the judge's second ground for rejecting the defendants' argument based on section 222.
It may be that the defendants could take this point by way of defence to the action: see Wandsworth London Borough Council v. Winder [1985]A.C. 461 and Roy v. Kensington and Chelsea and Westminster Family Practitioner Committee [1992]1 A.C. 624.
However, this was not argued before us, and I prefer to base my decision on the section 222 point by affirming the judge's first ground as mentioned above.
A number of other pleading points were taken on behalf of the defendants.
None of them raised any matter of substance and I need not consider them further.
Ralph Gibson L.J.
If by established principles of English law it is clear that Derbyshire County Council has the right to sue for libel then this court must say so and let the action proceed.
It would not matter that the consequence of so holding might be that the defendants, if they should lose the action, would satisfy the European Court of Human Rights that any verdict against them would constitute a breach of article 10 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.
Article 10, as with any other provision of the Convention, is not a rule of the law of this country: see Reg. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, Ex parte Brind [1991]1 A.C. 696.
If the defendants should succeed in such an application, upon the ground that a verdict and judgment for libel in favour of the council, as a local government authority, would constitute a breach of article 10, it would be for this country to decide whether to leave the law as it would, on that hypothesis, have been declared to be, or to change it to avoid the risk of repetition.
Mr. Lester pointed to earlier examples of such an outcome, namely the Contempt of Court Act 1981 following the decision of the European Court in The Sunday Times v. United Kingdom (1979) 2 E.H.R.R. 245 (the ‘Thalidomide’ case), and the introduction of R.S.C., Ord. 24, r. 14A after the settling of the Harman case (Home Office v. Harman [1983]1 A.C. 280) following the ruling of the European Commission of Human Rights:Harman v. United Kingdom (1984) 7 E.H.R.R. 146.
If, on the other hand, it is not clear by established principles of our law that the council has the right to sue in libel for alleged injury to its reputation, so that this court must decide whether under the common law that right is properly available to the council as a local government authority, then, as is not in dispute, this court must, in so deciding, have regard to the principles stated in the Convention and in particular to article 10: see Reg. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, Ex parte Brind [1991]1 A.C. 696.
In summary form, as I understood Mr. Newman's submissions for the council, the argument can be stated:(i) the council is a corporation created by the legislature for the performance of many functions for the public good: see section 1(1), section 2(1) and (3) and section 111 of the Local Government Act 1972.
The powers given to assist in the performance of those functions include the power to borrow money: Schedule 13 to the Act of 1972 as amended (now superseded by Part IV of the Local Government and Housing Act 1989).
The functions, including in particular those to be carried out for the direct benefit of individual members of the public, such as social services, may require the borrowing of money and do require the recruiting and employment of many men and women to work for the council.
The council employs some 30,000 people and operates upon an annual budget of about £500m. (ii) The proper performance of those functions requires that the council be able effectively to protect its reputation and to vindicate that reputation when falsely attacked.
(iii) It is established by authority binding on this court that a corporation, or ‘near corporation,’ created by Parliament has the right to sue in libel for injury to its reputation:South Hetton Coal Co. Ltd. v. North-Eastern News Association Ltd. [1894]1 Q.B.133 and National Union of General and Municipal Workers v. Gillian [1946]K.B. 81. (iv)
The need for the council to be able to protect its reputation by an action for libel is, with proper regard to the public interest, at least as great as that of a trading corporation or a trade union.
(v) The decision of Browne J. in Bognor Regis Urban District Council v. Campion [1972]2 Q.B.169 was, therefore, correct.
(vi) Since the council is capable of committing the tort of libel and of being held liable to pay damages in respect of a defamatory publication the law should provide the correlative right to sue for libel.
(vii) If the court reaches the point of weighing the social needs in issue, first that of securing to the council the effective means in law of protecting its reputation and, secondly, that of protecting the right of free expression of the people of this country, the court should hold that the remaining remedies for the council, if it could not sue for libel, and in particular the action for malicious falsehood, would not be a sufficient protection for the council's reputation, and the ability of a local authority such as the council to sue for libel would not improperly or unnecessarily restrict free expression.
I accept that the law has from the first appearance of corporations, in the absence of any relevant statutory direction, considered the question of a corporation's right to sue for defamation by reference to the nature of the corporation itself and the need for the corporation to protect its lawful activities and property.
As Pollock C.B. said in 1859 in Metropolitan Saloon Omnibus Co.
Ltd. v. Hawkins , 4 H. & N. 87, 90–91, in a passage cited by Morland J.:
‘That a corporation at common law can sue in respect of a libel there is no doubt.
It would be monstrous if a corporation could maintain no action for slander of title through which they lost a great deal of money.
It could not sue in respect of an imputation of murder, or incest, or adultery, because it could not commit those crimes.
Nor could it sue in respect of a charge of corruption, for a corporation cannot be guilty of corruption, although the individuals composing it may.
But it would be very odd if a corporation had no means of protecting itself against wrong; and if its property is injured by slander it has no means of redress except by action.
Therefore it appears to me clear that a corporation at common law may maintain an action for a libel by which its property is injured.
Then, has a corporation created under the [Joint Stock Companies Act 1856], 19 & 20 Vict. c. 47 the same power?
Though that Act makes the partnership a corporation,[it is said]…that this is merely for the purpose of carrying on the business mentioned in it, and that it can only sue in respect of matters necessarily incident to that purpose.
But in order to carry on business it is necessary that the reputation of such a corporation should be protected, and therefore in the case of libel or slander it must have a remedy by action.
From that decision Morland J. concluded that it is an ordinary incident of all corporations that they may sue for libel and that that included municipal corporations.
For my part I am unable to derive from that case so far reaching a proposition.
The court was, I think, going no further than was necessary to decide the case before it: the corporation was a private corporation formed under an Act of Parliament which was capable of holding property and of carrying on a business.
Such a corporation, it was held, should have the same power to maintain an action for a libel by which its property is injured as the law allowed to a corporation at common law, and the power to sue for libel or slander for the protection of its reputation in the carrying on of its business.
The court, however, did not permit to a corporation, simply because it has legal personality, all the rights of a natural person to sue for defamation.
Pollock C.B. regarded the power to sue for defamation with reference to certain imputations of criminal conduct to be excluded because of the inability of a corporation to commit crimes such as murder, or incest, or adultery, or corruption.
It was not at once noted that a corporation may by its agents commit, or counsel or procure, the commission of criminal offences as has since been established: see Rex v. I.C.R. Haulage Ltd. [1944]K.B.
551 where it was held that an indictment for a common law conspiracy to defraud will lie against a limited company.
The law, however, has never allowed a corporation to sue in respect of injury to its feelings on the basis that the injury might be suffered by its agents: as Lord Reid said in Lewis v. Daily Telegraph Ltd. [1964]A.C. 234, 262: ‘A company cannot be injured in its feelings,’ and he added, ‘it can only be injured in its pocket’but pecuniary damage to a corporation's reputation was not in issue in that case.
The same approach was adopted by the Divisional Court in 1891 in Manchester Corporation v. Williams [1891]1 Q.B.94; 63 L.T. 805, that is to say the court sought to determine to what extent the law, having regard to the nature of the corporation and of the libel alleged, should allow the corporation to sue for libel.
The alleged libel was to the effect that there was extensive bribery and corruption in three departments of the council and that the council were ‘either parties thereto or culpably ignorant thereof.’
The court held that the council could not maintain the action: ‘to allow such a thing would be wholly unprecedented and contrary to principle:’ 63 L.T. 805, 806,per Day J. There were two grounds of decision in effect, first, that a corporation might sue for a libel affecting property but not for one affecting personal reputation and, secondly, that the charge was one of bribery and corruption of which (see the Metropolitan Saloon Omnibus Co. case, 4 H. & N. 87)‘a corporation cannot possibly be guilty:’63 L.T. 805, 807.
Morland J. regarded the decision as made per incuriam and, therefore, not binding upon him, on the ground that, by reason of section 19 of the Public Bodies Corrupt Practices Act 1889 (52 & 53 Vict. c. 69), a local authority could be guilty of corruption.
This point, in my judgment, is not worth pursuing.
The stated reasoning for the decision in the Manchester Corporation case is not, in my judgment, satisfactory: see the criticism, cited by Morland J., by Spencer Bower, Actionable Defamation , at p. 280.
Further, it is not binding on this court.
In South Hetton Coal Co. Ltd. v. North-Eastern News Association Ltd. [1894]1 Q.B.133 the plaintiff corporation was a private trading company formed under statute.
This court held that such a corporation could sue for a libel calculated to injure its reputation in the way of its business without proof of special damage.
Morland J. held that there is no valid distinction between a private trading company and a local authority for the purposes of an action of libel not alleged to have caused actual financial damage.
Unless such a distinction is to be found, as the defendants say that it is, in the public nature of a local authority, which has governmental powers under statute and of which the policy and activities are decided by elected councillors, I agree with that view of Morland J. In the South Hetton Coal Co. case Lopes L.J.
said, at p. 141:
‘although a corporation cannot maintain an action for libel in respect of anything reflecting upon them personally, yet they can maintain an action for a libel reflecting on the management of their trade or business, and this without alleging or proving special damage.
A libel which falsely accused a local authority of applying policies of sex or racial discrimination in the recruitment of staff could, in my view, damage that authority in its reputation in the performing of its statutory functions and I can see no reason, other than the public nature of the authority, to deny to it the remedy which the law allows to a trading corporation in respect of similar damage.
This court, for similar reasons, allowed a registered trade union to sue for libel:National Union of General and Municipal Workers v. Gillian [1946]K.B.
81.
The approach of the court was, again, the same.
The registered trade union was ‘not a corporation; but…very much like one:’per Uthwatt J., at p. 88.
The legislation, the Trade Union Acts 1871 to 1927, demonstrated that Parliament intended that this new entity, or ‘near corporation,’ should be able to sue in respect of a tort, including the tort of libel.
There was nothing to suggest that that power to sue should be limited so as to exclude the proceedings before the court, save by the nature of the trade union itself, and that did not exclude a claim in respect of a libel ‘calculated to arouse doubts and suspicions in the minds of members [of the union itself], and so to destroy the cohesion and will to act of the union:’per Scott L.J.
at p. 86.
Since Morland J. found that the cases mentioned above demonstrated, without uncertainty or ambiguity, that the council as a local authority was entitled to sue for damages in respect of the libels alleged in the statement of claim, he held that it was not necessary to have regard to article 10.
He was, as I have said, correct in ignoring article 10 and the submissions based upon it if he was right that the law is certain.
In my judgment, however, the law is not certain and it is necessary for this court to consider whether, having regard to the right to free expression, the law of libel can be held to extend to a local government authority.
I take that view because the point has never been decided by this court or in the House of Lords and, as I have explained above, this court, in considering whether private corporations can sue for libel at common law, has not laid down any principle which is conclusive of the point raised in this case.
Further, while it was said that the decision of Browne J. in the Bognor Regis case [1972]2 Q.B.169 had been generally approved, or not criticised, by textbook writers, and by the Faulks Committee in 1975, it was not suggested that Parliament had in any legislation apparently treated that decision as representing settled law.
In order for this court to have proper regard to article 10, it is necessary to state first what test is to be applied.
Lord Goff of Chieveley in Attorney-General v. Guardian Newspapers Ltd.
(No. 2)[1990]1 A.C. 109, after reference to the principle of law that, in cases concerned with government secrets, the Crown, in order to restrain disclosure, must show not only that the information is confidential but also show that it is in the public interest that it should not be published, continued, at pp. 283–284:
‘Finally, I wish to observe that I can see no inconsistency between English law on this subject and article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights.
This is scarcely surprising, since we may pride ourselves on the fact that freedom of speech has existed in this country perhaps as long as, if not longer than, it has existed in any other country in the world.
The only difference is that, whereas article 10 of the Convention, in accordance with its avowed purpose, proceeds to state a fundamental right and then to qualify it, we in this country (where everybody is free to do anything, subject only to the provisions of the law) proceed rather upon an assumption of freedom of speech, and turn to our law to discover the established exceptions to it.
In any event I conceive it to be my duty, when I am free to do so, to interpret the law in accordance with the obligations of the Crown under this treaty.
The exercise of the right to freedom of expression under article 10 may be subject to restrictions (as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society) in relation to certain prescribed matters, which include ‘the interests of national security’ and ‘preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence.’
It is established in the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights that the word ‘necessary’ in this context implies the existence of a pressing social need, and that interference with freedom of expression should be no more than is proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued.
I have no reason to believe that English law, as applied in the courts, leads to any different conclusion.
That statement seems to me to be in accordance with the views of Lord Keith of Kinkel, at p. 256, and Lord Griffiths, at p. 273.
There is, I think, no material distinction between interpreting the law for the purposes of applying it, having due regard to article 10, and interpreting the law for the purposes of deciding, when the point has not been finally decided by the courts, whether the law does or does not provide to a local government authority the right to sue for libel.
The question for this court, therefore, is whether, by holding that a local government authority, such as the council, may sue in libel in respect of these publications, the law would impose greater restrictions upon freedom of expression than are necessary in a democratic society to meet any pressing social need for the protection of the reputation and rights of such a council.
The submissions for the defendants included the following:(i) a local authority, such as the council, is controlled by elected councillors and the ability to control such a council by the vote of the majority of councillors is the objective of political activity.
The actions of such a council are of general public importance and the free discussion of their activities is one aspect of the right of freedom of expression which is of the utmost importance.
Reference was made to Hector v. Attorney-General for Antigua and Barbuda [1990]2 A.C. 312 where the constitutional validity of a statutory provision creating a criminal offence was in issue.
Lord Bridge of Harwich said, at p. 318:
‘In a free democratic society it is almost too obvious to need stating that those who hold office in government and who are responsible for public administration must always be open to criticism.
Any attempt to stifle or fetter such criticism amounts to political censorship of the most insidious and objectionable kind.
At the same time it is no less obvious that the very purpose of criticism levelled at those who have the conduct of public affairs by their political opponents is to undermine public confidence in their stewardship and to persuade the electorate that the opponents would make a better job of it than those presently holding office.
In the light of these considerations their Lordships cannot help viewing a statutory provision which criminalises statements likely to undermine public confidence in the conduct of public affairs with the utmost suspicion.
(ii) Next it was submitted that it is an excessive restriction upon free expression to extend the ordinary law of libel, which is necessary for the protection of the reputation of private individuals, to a local government authority.
That law would permit such an authority to rely upon presumed injury to its reputation because the defendant, who had accomplished a statement reflecting upon the reputation of the local authority, would have to prove the truth if he sought to justify the publication; and, if he had commented adversely upon the conduct of the council, he would have to prove the substantial truth of the facts upon which the comment was based.
The mere fact that the comment was directed to the actions of a local government authority would not enable the defendant to rely upon qualified privilege; and the fact that he had published without malice in good faith and in the belief that the facts stated were true would afford no defence if the facts were not true.
Reference was made again to the judgment in Hector where Lord Bridge of Harwich said, at p. 318:
‘it was submitted that it was unobjectionable to penalise false statements made without taking due care to verify their accuracy.
Their Lordships do not find it necessary for present purposes to examine the question what element of mens rea is required as an ingredient of the offences…
They observe, however, that it would on any view be a grave impediment to the freedom of the press if those who print, or a fortiori those who distribute, matter reflecting critically on the conduct of public authorities could only do so with impunity if they could first verify the accuracy of all statements of fact on which the criticism was based.
(iii) Denial to the council of the right to sue in libel would still leave the council free to proceed for damages in an action for malicious falsehood and to invoke, if they could, the law of criminal libel.
Such protection should be seen as all that is necessary in a democratic society for the protection of the reputation and rights of a local government authority.
(iv) If the right to sue in libel should be extended to a local government authority it could not logically be withheld from any government authority having separate legal personality.
Those authorities upon which corporate status, and therefore separate legal personality, has been conferred include the Treasury Solicitor by the Treasury Solicitor Act 1876 (39 & 40 Vict. c. 18) and the government departments of Defence, Agriculture Fisheries and Food, Education and Science, Energy, Trade and Industry, the Environment, and Social Services.
Corporate status, however, has not been given to the Home Office.
No principle is discernible, nor has any been suggested, to explain or justify the giving of corporate status to some but not to other government authorities.
(v) Most libels of any gravity directed at the conduct of a local authority would sufficiently identify the councillors or officers concerned in or responsible for that conduct so as to enable individual councillors or officers to sue for libel just as, in this case, Mr. Bookbinder has brought proceedings in respect of the libels complained of by the council.
(vi) If the court should hold that a right to sue in libel must be allowed to a local government authority, then, in the alternative, this court should, in extending the law of libel to permit actions by a local authority, impose particular restrictions or limitations upon the cause of action, namely that a local authority could only sue for libel upon proof of special damage; and that the council would be required to prove both the falsity of the allegation and that it was published maliciously.
Conclusion
To allow a local government authority to sue for libel would, in my judgment, impose a substantial restriction upon freedom of expression.
Anyone who publishes a statement, which reflects adversely upon the conduct by a local authority of its affairs, risks liability to any individual councillor or officer of the authority who can prove that the publication defames him or her personally.
To allow the local authority itself, also, to sue in libel under the law applicable to actions by an ordinary individual would add substantially to the restriction caused by that ordinary risk.
A decision that a local authority should take proceedings for libel, if the action were available at law, would probably be made by the majority of councillors in defence of the reputation of the council with reference to conduct for which that majority might be responsible; and the proceedings would be conducted at the expense of the local taxpayers.
The ability to take such proceedings might well restrict or prevent public discussion of matters of public importance despite the willingness of any person wishing to take part in that discussion to take every reasonable precaution to avoid defamatory imputation against any identifiable individual.
Further, any person contemplating publication of statements in such a discussion would face duplication of the proceedings and increased costs in any case where the allegations made do identify an individual councillor or officer.
In New York Times Co. v. Sullivan , 376 U.S. 254, Brennan J., giving the opinion of the court, by which a judgment for damages for libel in the courts of the State of Alabama in favour of an elected government official was set aside, said, at p. 277:
‘What a state may not constitutionally bring about by means of a criminal statute is likewise beyond the reach of its civil law of libel.
…The fear of damage awards under a rule such as that invoked by the Alabama courts here may be markedly more inhibiting than the fear of prosecution under a criminal statute.
See City of Chicago v. Tribune Co. (1923) 139 N.E. 86, 90.
Then, at p. 279:
‘A rule compelling the critic of official conduct to guarantee the truth of all his factual assertions — and to do so on pain of libel judgments virtually unlimited in amount — leads to a comparable ‘self-censorship.’
Allowance of the defence of truth, with the burden of proving it on the defendant, does not mean that only false speech will be deterred.
…Even courts accepting this defence as an adequate safeguard have recognised the difficulties of adducing legal proofs that the alleged libel was true in all its factual particulars.
…Under such a rule, would-be critics of official conduct may be deterred from voicing their criticism, even though it is believed to be true and even though it is in fact true, because of doubt whether it can be proved in court or fear of the expense of having to do so.
They tend to make only statements which ‘steer far wider of the unlawful zone’.
…The rule thus dampens the vigour and limits the variety of public debate.
It is inconsistent with the First and Fourteenth Amendments.
The reference to the City of Chicago case is to a rule which prohibits any action for defamation by a local government authority.
The Sullivan case was concerned, as this case is not, with a limitation upon the right of an elected official to sue for defamation.
The description, however, of the restrictive effect of the civil law of libel given by Brennan J. seems to me to be fairly applicable to the civil law of libel of this country.
It is on the other hand, in my judgment, necessary in our democratic society for a local government authority to be able to take appropriate proceedings for the protection of its property and reputation.
If those who profit from the sale of descriptions of their investigations and speculations about matters of public interest are not restrained by fear of appropriate penal or financial consequences from publishing defamatory statements which are false, it is likely that some of them would publish so much in the nature of defamatory allegations against public organisations, and the men and women who run those organisations, that the public, if there was no effective process for determining whether the charges were substantially true or not, might cease to be greatly concerned about the charges save for such amusement as the stories might provide.
Such a state of affairs would, of course, protect serious public discussion of matters of social importance but it would also debase much of the discussion of public affairs.
With reference to individuals in public life, if a serious allegation is made the public now expects the question of the truth or falsity of it to be demonstrated by the taking of proceedings, whether the proceedings result in a decision of the court or an apology and settlement.
For these reasons I have considered anxiously whether, if the law should be held not to provide to a local government authority the right to sue for libel, the need for adequate protection of the reputation of such an authority would be sufficiently met by other remedies.
At this point it is relevant to consider the significance of the fact that this case is, as we are told, only the third case in which a local authority has taken proceedings for libel.
It suggests that there has been hitherto no perceived need for local authorities to assert the right for denying which in 1891 the court was severely criticised, or to use the right which was held to exist by Browne J., to whom no submissions were made based on article 10, in the Bognor Regis case [1972]2 Q.B.169 in 1972.
I suspect that the reason why the right has been so little asserted or used is because of the established right of individuals, who are personally libelled by a false attack upon a local authority, to sue for damages and because those in control of local authorities have sensibly left the issues to be resolved in those proceedings.
I think that a case might arise in which the reputation of a local authority might be damaged, so as to impair its function for the public good, in which no private individual was defamed; and in which the public interest would be served by the taking of proceedings for libel by the local authority in order to determine the falsity of the charge.
I see the force of the point that councillors should be trusted to use the right to sue for libel only in circumstances where it is necessary in the public interest.
I acknowledge that experience has shown that local authority councillors have not sought to assert the right to sue in libel, save in a very small number of cases.
Nevertheless, my conclusion is that to allow a local government authority to sue for libel would impose an added and substantial restriction upon freedom of expression which, having regard to the ability of individuals within a local authority to sue for libel, and to the ability of a local government authority to sue for malicious falsehood, or to invoke the criminal law of libel, cannot be regarded as necessary in our democratic society.
For these reasons, and for the reasons set out in the judgment of Balcombe L.J., I would allow this appeal.
Butler-Sloss L.J.
I have had an opportunity of reading the judgment of Balcombe L.J.
in draft and I gratefully adopt his summary of the facts.
The two main questions which arise from the preliminary issue are:(1) can a non-trading body corporate sue for libel under English law?(2) If the answer to (1) is ‘Yes,’ is a local authority or other governmental body in a different position from other trading or non-trading corporations and, having regard to the right of freedom of expression as set out in article 10 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, unable to sue?
I shall turn first to the general right of a body corporate to maintain an action for libel.
‘That a corporation at common law can sue in respect of a libel there is no doubt,’ stated Pollock C.B. in Metropolitan Saloon Omnibus Co.
Ltd. v. Hawkins , 4 H. & N. 87, 90.
Watson B. in the same case said, at p. 93:
‘One of the safeguards to individuals against libel is the remedy by action; and I cannot conceive a proposition more dangerous than this, that because a company is incorporated they have no appeal to a court of justice if they are libelled.
A corporation has an artificial persona and consequently there are certain allegations in respect of which it cannot sue.
But a trading corporation has a trading reputation which it is entitled to protect: see the Metropolitan Saloon Omnibus Co. case.
The Divisional Court in Manchester Corporation v. Williams [1891]1 Q.B.94 held, on a preliminary point, that Manchester Corporation could not sue for libel in respect of a charge of bribery and corruption since a corporation was unable to be guilty of corruption, following the dicta of Pollock C.B. in the Metropolitan Saloon Omnibus Co. case.
The Divisional Court decision has been much criticised; I agree with the strictures of Spencer Bower, Actionable Defamation (fully set out in the judgment of Balcombe L.J.) and would not wish to follow the reasoning of the Divisional Court which, in any event, is not binding upon us.
In South Hetton Coal Co. Ltd. v. North-Eastern News Association Ltd. [1894]1 Q.B.133 this court held that an action of libel will lie at the suit of an incorporated trading company in respect of a libel calculated to injure its reputation in the way of its business, without proof of special damage.
Lord Esher M.R. said, at p. 138:
‘…I have come to the conclusion that the law of libel is one and the same as to all plaintiffs; and that, in every action of libel, whether the statement complained of is, or is not, a libel, depends on the same question — viz., whether the jury are of opinion that what has been published with regard to the plaintiff would tend in the minds of people of ordinary sense to bring the plaintiff into contempt, hatred, or ridicule, or to injure his character.
The question is really the same by whomsoever the action is brought — whether by a person, a firm, or a company.
But though the law is the same, the application of it is, no doubt, different with regard to different kinds of plaintiffs.
Having considered ways in which a company might be libelled he continued, at p. 139:
‘Then, if the case be one of libel — whether on a person, a firm, or a company — the law is that the damages are at large.
It is not necessary to prove any particular damage; the jury may give such damages as they think fit, having regard to the conduct of the parties respectively, and all the circumstances of the case.
Equally, a non-trading, non-profitmaking corporation has a reputation which it is entitled to protect.
In National Union of General and Municipal Workers v. Gillian [1946]K.B.
81 this court held that a registered trade union might sue in its own name for libel where the defamatory statements touched its collective reputation.
The fact that subsequent legislation has removed the right of a registered trade union to sue in libel does not affect the principle enunciated in the Gillian case.
Browne J. in Bognor Regis Urban District Council v. Campion [1972]2 Q.B.169 considered the specific question whether a local authority could sue for libel.
He followed the principles set out in the Gillian case and concluded that a local authority had a ‘governing reputation’ capable of being damaged by libellous statements in respect of which it might sue for injury to reputation without the need to prove damage to its property.
His argument in distinguishing the Manchester Corporation case is difficult to accept but his decision was supported by the Faulks Committee on Defamation (1975): Report of the Committee.
However, it seems likely that neither Browne J. nor the Faulks Committee was asked to consider the implications of article 10 to which I shall later refer in detail.
Consequently, from the authorities to which I have referred above and a number of decisions in other common law jurisdictions which we have been invited to consider, I have come to the conclusion that there is no difference in principle between a trading company and a non-trading corporation for the purposes of suing in tort, including the tort of defamation.
In each case a corporation has its reputation, separate from its members, capable of being adversely affected by defamatory statements and which it is entitled to protect by recourse to an action for libel.
Consequently, the answer to question 1 is ‘Yes’, and so far I agree with the decision of Morland J.
Is a local authority which is a non-trading corporation in a different position from other non-trading corporations?
The judge was unimpressed by the argument based on freedom of speech and the application of article 10, and dismissed it summarily in these terms [1991]4 All E.R.
795, 806: ‘I do not find any uncertainty or ambiguity in relation to the ambit of English law in relation to the extent to which local authorities may sue for libel.’
After several days of argument in this court and consideration of conflicting authorities, with no decision of this court or the House of Lords on the point, I, for my part, cannot dismiss it so easily.
I am driven to the conclusion that in the present state of the law, article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights, and equally article 19 of the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (to similar effect) do apply.
The United Kingdom is a signatory to both the Convention (1951) and the Covenant (1976) although neither has been incorporated into our domestic law.
The impact of article 10 has only recently been regarded as significant, but in the context of breach of confidence and of contempt article 10 has now assumed considerable importance.
The main thrust of Mr. Lester's submissions for the defendants has never previously been considered in the context of libel.
Mr. Lester argues that article 10 is equally important in the law of libel where a governmental corporation, whether national or local, is the plaintiff.
In Attorney-General v. Guardian Newspapers Ltd.
(No. 2)[1990]1 A.C. 109 Lord Goff of Chieveley said (in relation to breach of confidential information), at p. 283:
‘…
I wish to observe that I can see no inconsistency between English law on this subject and article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights.
This is scarcely surprising, since we may pride ourselves on the fact that freedom of speech has existed in this country perhaps as long as, if not longer than, it has existed in any other country in the world.
The only difference is that, whereas article 10 of the Convention, in accordance with its avowed purpose, proceeds to state a fundamental right and then to qualify it, we in this country (where everybody is free to do anything, subject only to the provisions of the law) proceed rather upon an assumption of freedom of speech, and turn to our law to discover the established exceptions to it.
In any event I conceive it to be my duty, when I am free to do so, to interpret the law in accordance with the obligations of the Crown under this treaty.
Adopting, as I respectfully do, that approach to the Convention, the principles governing the duty of the English court to take account of article 10 appear to be as follows: where the law is clear and unambiguous, either stated as the common law or enacted by Parliament, recourse to article 10 is unnecessary and inappropriate.
Consequently the law of libel in respect of individuals does not require the court to consider the Convention.
But where there is an ambiguity, or the law is otherwise unclear or so far undeclared by an appellate court, the English court is not only entitled but, in my judgment, obliged to consider the implications of article 10.
Ralph Gibson L.J.
in Attorney-General v. Newspaper Publishing Plc .,
The Times, 28 February 1990: Court of Appeal (Civil Division) Transcript No. 171 of 1990, said in respect of contempt of court:
‘if it is demonstrated by reference to authority binding on this court, or by reference to clearly established principles of the common law, that the appellants were rightly held to have committed the actus reus of contempt of court, this court cannot apply directly the terms of the Convention so as to reach a different conclusion.
If, however, it is not clear in what terms the relevant law is to be formulated, and there is no binding authority upon the matter, this court should have regard to the terms of the Convention because it is a safe presumption that the law of contempt of court in this country is in conformity with the requirements of that Convention.
See also Lord Bridge of Harwich and Lord Ackner in Reg. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, Ex parte Brind [1991]1 A.C. 671, 747, 760.
Ralph Gibson L.J. 's observations seem equally applicable to libel.
In the present case there is no binding authority upon this court, and I do not consider the law to be clear.
Even if it were, in a decision of the Divisional Court on blasphemy Watkins L.J.
thought it necessary to consider the Convention, even although the law on blasphemy was clear:Reg. v. Chief Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate, Ex parte Choudhury [1991]1 Q.B.429, 449.
Accordingly, it is for this court to consider the application of article 10 to the question whether a local authority may sue for libel; and in my judgment Morland J. was wrong not to do so.
Article 10 is in these terms:
‘1.
Everyone has the right to freedom of expression.
This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers.…
2.
The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.
The European Court of Human Rights has considered the application of article 10 to contempt of court in The Sunday Times v. United Kingdom (1979) 2 E.H.R.R. 245; to criminal defamation in Lingens v. Austria (1986) 8 E.H.R.R. 407 and to breach of confidential information in The Sunday Times v. United Kingdom (No. 2)(unreported), 26 November 1991, Series A No. 217.
In each case the court considered whether the interference complained of was necessary in a democratic society.
In the Lingens case it said, at p. 418:
‘39.
The adjective ‘necessary,’ within the meaning of article 10(2), implies the existence of a ‘pressing social need’.
…The contracting states have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists…but it goes hand in hand with a European supervision, embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it, even those given by an independent court.
…40.
…The court must determine whether the interference at issue was ‘proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued’ and whether the reasons adduced by the Austrian courts to justify it are ‘relevant and sufficient’.
…41.
In this connection, the court has to recall that freedom of expression, as secured in paragraph 1 of article 10, constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and one of the basic conditions for its progress and for each individual's self-fulfilment.
Subject to paragraph 2, it is applicable not only to ‘information’ or ‘ideas’that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb.
Such are the demands of that pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no ‘democratic society’.
…These principles are of particular importance as far as the press is concerned.
Whilst the press must not overstep the bounds set, inter alia, for the ‘protection of the reputation of others’, it is nevertheless incumbent on it to impart information and ideas on political issues just as on those in other areas of public interest.
Not only does the press have the task of imparting such information and ideas: the public also has a right to receive them.…
The right of criticism of government institutions and the conduct of affairs by public bodies has been upheld in other common law countries.
The American courts have robustly upheld the right of freedom of speech and the right of the press to publish.
In the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan , 376 U.S. 254 relating to the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the American Constitution, the sentiments expressed by Brennan J. in his opinion accord closely with the approach of the European Court of Human Rights.
Having considered earlier authorities he said, at p. 270:
‘Thus we consider this case against the background of a profound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open, and that it may well include vehement, caustic and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public officials.
He cited Madison (Elliot's Debates on the Federal Constitution (1876), vol. 4, p. 571), at p. 271: ‘Some degree of abuse is inseparable from the proper use of every thing; and in no instance is this more true than in that of the press.’
In respect of requiring to prove that the alleged libel was true in all its factual particulars he said, at p. 279:
‘Under such a rule, would-be critics of official conduct may be deterred from voicing their criticism, even though it is believed to be true and even though it is in fact true, because of doubt whether it can be proved in court or fear of the expense of having to do so.
They tend to make only statements which ‘steer far wider of the unlawful zone’.
…The rule thus dampens the vigour and limits the variety of public debate.
It is inconsistent with the First and Fourteenth Amendments.
The American law of libel, including as it does no protection for the individual politician as well as political institutions, goes further along the road of freedom of the press than the English law; nor would I wish to extend it.
But the observations of Brennan J. lend in my view powerful persuasive support to the arguments advanced by Mr. Lester in the case of governmental institutions.
In Commonwealth of Australia v. John Fairfax & Sons Ltd. , 147 C.L.R. 39, Mason J. (whose speech was cited with approval by Lord Keith of Kinkel in Attorney-General v. Guardian Newspapers Ltd.
(No. 2)[1990]1 A.C. 109, 258) said, at p. 52:
‘It is unacceptable in our democratic society that there should be a restraint on the publication of information relating to government when the only vice of that information is that it enables the public to discuss, review and criticise government action.
The Privy Council in Hector v. Attorney-General of Antigua and Barbuda [1990]2 A.C. 312 held that the prosecution of an editor of a newspaper with an offence under the Public Order Act 1972 (No. 9 of 1972) of Antigua contravened the rights of the individual under their Constitution.
Lord Bridge of Harwich said, at p. 318:
‘In a free democratic society it is almost too obvious to need stating that those who hold office in government and who are responsible for public administration must always be open to criticism.
Any attempt to stifle or fetter such criticism amounts to political censorship of the most insidious and objectionable kind.
A decision to the contrary in the British Columbia Court of Appeal,City of Prince George v. British Columbia Television System Ltd. , 95 D.L.R. (3d) 577, held that a municipality could sue for libel, but did not consider the argument of competing interests and the balancing exercise required under article 10, and I do not consider it to be relevant to this appeal.
I also believe that the application of article 10 to local authorities is right in principle.
A local authority is a corporation.
It is also an elected body, elected in local elections and often run in council on party political lines, as is this council.
Elected councillors are politicians in the public domain.
They are and expect to be exposed to criticism and comment from many quarters within their sphere of activity.
Such comment may, and no doubt does, from time to time overstep boundaries acceptable to the individual or local authority so criticised.
Although this appeal is only the third case ever brought by a local authority to come before the courts, not only are there numerous local authorities, we were also provided with a list of government departments which happen to be bodies corporate and would, on the argument of Mr. Newman for the council, equally have the right to sue for libel.
In The Sunday Times v. United Kingdom (No. 2), 26 November 1991 the European Court of Human Rights, following its decision in Lingens (1986) 8 E.H.R.R. 407, set out the principles enshrined in article 10:
‘(a)…
Freedom of expression, as enshrined in article 10, is subject to a number of exceptions which, however, must be narrowly interpreted and the necessity for any restrictions must be convincingly established.
(b)…
Not only does the press have the task of imparting such information and ideas: the public also has a right to receive them.
Were it otherwise, the press would be unable to play its vital role of ‘public watchdog’.
Mr. Newman has argued that the earlier decisions involved the application of prior restraints and exercise of the discretion of the court, whereas the issue of a writ in libel is the first step in an action which a party has a right to take and consequently is outside the principles enunciated in those cases.
The issue of a writ for libel does not in itself create a prior restraint in contrast to the grant of an injunction.
But the threat of libel proceedings is seen as a deterrent both by the individual and also by large organisations, even the press.
The ability of a local authority to sue in libel would be likely to have a chilling effect upon the potential commentator in an area of public concern about which the public at large has an interest in receiving information and observations.
Brennan J. in the Sullivan case, 376 U.S. 254, 277, said:
‘The fear of damage awards under a rule such as that invoked by the Alabama courts here may be markedly more inhibiting than the fear of prosecution under a criminal statute.
Consequently, the threat of libel proceedings has some similarity to the application for an injunction and the observations of the European Court of Human Rights are in my view relevant to this appeal.
Before turning to the competing interests and engaging in the balancing exercise, it is necessary to consider who is the public authority who may be seen to be exercising the interference referred to in article 10(1).
Mr. Newman has urged us to treat the Derbyshire County Council as the public authority and leave it to the court in each individual libel action to undertake the balancing exercise of the competing interests.
It is true that the Derbyshire County Council is a public authority and it is engaged in an attempt to discourage a national newspaper from critical comment about its affairs by an action for damages.
But Mr. Lester raises a more fundamental argument, with which I agree, that the effect of this court declaring the law in such a way as to enable the local authority to sue in libel, would be interference by a judicial authority with the right of freedom of expression of the press.
Such a judicial interference is unacceptable unless it falls within the exceptions set out in article 10(2), which are to be narrowly interpreted and the necessity for any restrictions convincingly established.
This issue involves a question of principle as to whether a local authority can sue for libel and not a decision to be made in respect of each individual action.
This court has to balance the competing interests of the freedom of the press to provide information, to comment, criticise, offend, shock or disturb, against the right of a governmental corporation to be protected against the false, or seriously inaccurate, or unjust accounts of its activities.
I have already set out the dangers of allowing a governmental authority to have the right to sue.
But in doing the balancing act it is necessary also to consider whether an injustice will be perpetrated if a local authority does not have the right to protect its governing reputation by an action for libel, and whether such an action, if available to a local authority, would be proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued.
If a local authority was unable to sue in libel it would not, however, be without recourse to the courts.
There seem to me to be three possible remedies:(1) an action for malicious falsehood;(2) a prosecution, with leave of the judge for criminal libel; and (3) an action for libel by an individual within the local authority.
The action of malicious or injurious falsehood has both similarities to, and important differences from, an action for libel.
These are conveniently set out in Duncan & Neill on Defamation , 2nd ed., p. 3, para. 2.03 and have been summarised in the judgment of Balcombe L.J.; I do not propose to repeat them.
However, in my view, the availability of the action for malicious falsehood is sufficient to demonstrate the absence of a pressing social need which would justify a local authority maintaining an action for libel.
Criminal libel is unlikely to occur other than rarely, but is available to define the limits of acceptable behaviour.
A libel action by an individual within the council, however, raises practical considerations.
A local authority, although a separate entity, operates through its members, its officers and other employees.
Defamation of a local authority is likely to be defamation also of one or more of its members or officers.
In this case, in addition to a writ issued by the Derbyshire County Council, the former leader of the council, Mr. Bookbinder, has sued for libel and his action, which is based almost word for word upon the same allegations as those in the council's statement of claim, continues.
In this case the vindication, or otherwise, of the individual is likely to have a similar effect upon the council.
This is a valuable, although indirect, additional protection for the local authority.
For the local authority to sue in libel in respect of the same matters complained of by the individual would create a duplication of proceedings and an added burden upon defendants to the action.
In my view, the existing available protection is adequate and gives to a governmental body all such rights as are necessary in a democratic society for the protection of its governing reputation.
To give it more would be out of proportion to the need shown and would entail too high a risk of unjustifiable interference with the freedom of expression of the press and public.
In carrying out the balancing exercise I, for my part, come down in favour of the freedom of speech even though it may go beyond generally acceptable limits, since there is adequate alternative protection available to a council.
I have come to this conclusion with some hesitation.
But this issue has not been the subject of legislation, nor previously been considered by this court or the House of Lords, and in such circumstances the alternatives are either to dismiss the appeal despite the relevance of article 10 and wait for Parliament to reconsider the state of the law; or, as the courts have from time to time demonstrated their ability and willingness to do, venture into relatively unchartered waters and declare the present state of the law.
That step was taken recently by the House of Lords by their decision of the existence of marital rape: see Reg. v. R. [1992]1 A.C. 599.
Mr. Lester suggested as an alternative argument that this court should impose conditions upon the right of a local authority to sue for libel, such as the requirement to prove special damage.
Since I am persuaded by Mr. Lester's first argument on article 10, I do not propose to review further the alternatives; but if it had been necessary to make a decision I, for my part, would have found the task more suited to Parliament than to this court.
To accede to his arguments would require an unacceptable degree of judicial creativity.
For the reasons which I have set out I consider that Morland J. was wrong, both not to apply article 10 and to hold that the Derbyshire County Council could sue for libel.
In respect of the third point which arises under section 222(1) of the Local Government Act 1972, I agree with and respectfully adopt the observations of Balcombe L.J.
I would allow the appeal.
Appeal allowed with costs in Court of Appeal and below.
Leave to appeal.
