Your alarm clock went off this morning then Pete?
Oh yes  
Yeah  
this morning he, did he actually remember to set it last evening 
Ooh 
Sunday, he was a bit the worse 
press the button before it 


 

How was it, game last night?
Terrible
No, no 


He's a bastard
Ha  what Wolverhampton was, yeah,like
He didn't bloody tell me did he
he
he said he'd been through recently, oh every time I've been through Wolverhampton that ring road's been awful the traffic like
Yeah, the 
Probably gonna wait ten years  
 

It was, it was a bastard  
I think he's, he's moved in cos every morning
He does  which one you doing?
I'd have a trainee
Yeah, not  
it'll be night time 
On the road
Yeah, by the canal bridge?
I would think
that coming from that way you say and er, there's normally a few spaces this time of day, well up the road there's   and I thought
Took mine round the corner 
I've got a B T van normally when I'm working  parked underneath
Yeah
it's  car park you know.
Yeah, well that's why I
get in, you'd find your car right at the back.
yeah,
Yeah 
True
You're Alan's  Alan 
Yes
Oh
yes
or  Ben
Well I won't be  after today
No, that's right 
After er, er, tomorrow they're all one big staff here 
They all coming onto yours are they?
Yeah, yeah they mentioned you the other day at  Eddy just said to him you know,
So you're gonna have Tim  and the rest of them on your  
Yeah , it'll be great because they all, cos they all like you don't say
but the er, at the joint meeting of course they're all a bit subdued, cos they're coming onto to  well what'll happened, cos I've work up there, they're much more gregarious than the bloke down here, so they'll take the stuff out of especially when , so we'll be doing it.
Mm 
There'll be  
I think there was thirty two people at the  meeting  but, six or seven people 
I'll have Alan 
be like the days of  
The 
Yeah 
All one big happy family under the big  
and looking at that programme always, only have to be, pretty engaging months and years, just the only job they  back, they would  and the nineteen ninety five might be what federal  just  
We're doomed 


I ain't no building them just to get all out and up done, I mean the programme now looks crowded, but when you look at the new programme it's just full, there's nowhere else and no more room in them boxes to write my  instead of one every two, three months, there's four and five every month  starts something
Yes, so what you're worried about the big nineties 
I'm the lucky, I'd be the lucky  I don't know.
Mm.
only thing we could, prospect for the er, like twenty years service   


training is alright innit?
Cos you can train people to do anything 
Yeah, but you've got to have people to train 
Not all the trainings  only crap ain't it?
 
you can have a bit of  brilliant really are  
If you walk into something else, it would be brilliant wouldn't it?
you're alright aren't you?
But erm, I mean the money's you know you'll pay the mortgage on, pay all your debts off and you, once you've got mortgage is gone that's it, you haven't got any  have you?
Tempting isn't it?
It is yeah
Yeah 
The trouble is, with this job I mean we're not trying to  and start ourselves up doing something are we?
I mean, I'm really looking forward to  I mean most of your bloody time  within a year I'm getting out  you can start doing what you want then, but when you don't have that regular period  you don't know how you're gonna react to your own , you've got to  
 
and then when you get there, you know,
so you got mollycoddle in a way, haven't you, so you know you say 
lay your money down 
you're not geared to do anything else, it's cos your attitude I suppose,anything else, if you really had to, er I don't see why it wouldn't 
Well when you talk to these blokes in a pool room  area service manager, what the hell  they give you a price over the counter 
come down from the actual job
There's 
 

And we're, we are, we're  ourselves if you're in a  mess then people out there have got virtually no training other than what they've been given 
Mm 
 

 

Did you say we can change this on the first screen  custody?
Yeah
Yeah 


Just trying to get away early 
I found that yesterday when  everybody was saying 


I like playing  wouldn't  enough but it is good.

Morning Ton

He was another one who sent you to Wolverhampton
Yes he was wasn't he?
