Any plans?
Well I, obviously want to try and attend meetings if and when possible, er I've been to one last week, which basically was er  because I don't feel I'm qualified to get up and  David  got up and spoke very well actually, he was always, at the police not neighbourhood watch, er to do with the cascade telephone system which we found out afterwards, after a three quarters hour debate a man came up to Dave afterwards and showed him a memo which said this cascade system has now ceased in November nineteen ninety-two and that was the the abuse on that particular meeting.
I do intend to er to attend inaugural meetings with each of the C P O s er with a view to looking I mean obviously at some stages you said to me that I would probably have to attend at short notice
Mm
probably by going to these meetings I can pick up the be best practice for ideas which can be passed on to the others
If anybody hears of any neighbourhood watch group meetings, I think make sure Paul knows about it so he can attend where possible
Yeah
Like him to go and look at the one at er the at er  which seems to be a successful one
Well I went to the  last week and I did say that I'd like to go to that one, I'll go to as many as I can
Yeah
what I would like and I'm sure it happens with the previous C P O er and I have been notified by telephone and I keep saying to them let me know, but I would like probably a memo from each C P O to say that there is a meeting on this particular night.
Do you mean inaugural meetings
Well an any meetings really because I think if I can er show my face at these meetings it might er I mean I think whether or not it's because of the increase in burglaries or whether it's because of the publicity via David we seem to have had er a hell of a lot of er enquiries about the schemes.
More than normal Tracy ain't it?
Yeah I think so
Yeah
Okay er
It's amazing that he's 
What you saying that for Jed, how long you been saying that for?
Yeah I know, but there has ain't there, you know but I say that and I live in an area where there's not a neighbourhood watch scheme and I ain't setting one up to until I retire
As crime goes up, people see it as a way of protecting their property don't they
Yes
seventeen per cent of reported crime is up
mm
Erm, may I make a comment on neighbourhood watch, I went to er a job the other day, it was a theatre, I was off duty and er I got tapped on the shoulder by my local neighbourhood watch co-ordinator who said, nine months ago I resigned, I wrote a letter to headquarters, I wrote a letter to the divisional commander, and I wrote a letter to the local constable, and nobody's replied to me and they still keep sending me papers are you gonna get your act together, now I I have brought this up before, we never ever have let a neighbourhood watch scheme lapse, it's nothing to do with you, this is all before you came 
no 
Er we just kept them on and there's I know quite a few schemes have stopped working but we've still got them written down somewhere
probably now we started it might be well worth while g getting rid of some of these schemes that aren't operating
Are you saying then that when one's lapsed for six months or over a given period of time we should actually go out there and remove the signs
Yeah
Well that's one of my next questions because I think it's debatable either way, a a lot of people and I'm finding this just want to be in a neighbourhood watch scheme to take advantage of insurance er and also to have the sign up once the signs are up and they got insurance  they're not bothered, and you can tell that by the er gist of the conversation on the telephone.
The other the other thing is I've discussed this with C P Os as regards the signs, if a scheme folds then we take the sign down, there are arguments for and against,
No No
say yeh or nay at the moment
No
But if the sign's left up surely that's erm
deterrent
towards crime prevention on the other hand it might make some people realise that if they're no longer a scheme then they don't get the er the
Yeah
Once a co-ordinator's retired or resigned who do you actually communicate with to find out if the group wants to continue playing
Well it should be in the file and I asked for this and keep it before me when a scheme is set up, A we have a map which I must have sent out  letters,
em
I've received very few replies so the signs can be erected and B either a deputy co-ordinator or the deputies that should come in, now some some oblige a lot of them don't
Right well let's find one or two of these schemes that appear to have lapsed, send some letters to the names in the file, if we don't get any positive response within a couple of months, let's go and take the signs down er and then wait for the squeals
We'll do it ourselves, although the council are the only people who can put them up anyone can take them down,
All you need is a pair of wire cutters
wire cutters and we'll have them down, have 'em back here, and they won't be wasted, cos although you can't use the straps again we're always short of fronts because of damage cos you can regularly replace the fronts but not the straps
Well we can buy straps, or always order some more straps if that's the case
Yes
It'll also if we start to take action provoke somebody else to take over the schemes,
Well that's right
At the moment nobody's interested
But I think we need to prove that we've actually communicated with quite a few people to say that if we don't hear from you in two months then I'm afraid the scheme will lapse.
Is that down to us or should we notify the division to make contact
No if if we notify the division after the end of it
We can only write to people we know it might well be twenty out of thirty houses wanted
Well
I think you'll find, but they might be more up to date than Mike
Well then, in that case let's send a copy letter to the local station
I think so
for their information 
I intend o go through all the files in due course, I mean it's
Well
It its a big task, em er the thing is that I think that that the first point of call is one is that we get the questionnaire out and see whether you know the one where can we can the questionnaires  to all the neighbourhood watch is it,w w we prepare the questionnaire and we get on and send it out, right.
Depending on the replies from them in relation to those that have lapsed we then send a second letter to them saying is there anybody that will take over the scheme, if not, right we we intend to remove the signs from the er from the area and then if there is no reply to this letter within fourteen days we you know we'll come and remove the signs.
I think there's a lot of them
That trawl will bring out a couple of dozen schemes that have totally lapsed, and people will write snotty letters saying I've told you this once before.
Mm yeah
So great, let's communicate with any other deputies and say if you're not prepared to take it over we'll close the we're afraid the scheme will have to close down.
And
And remove the signs
And any claim and and please inform your insurance companies,
And depending on the area we'll give a photocopy of the map and Derek will fetch 'em in, Derek can take them down.
Who'll  doing
No 
We have that many er applications I mean I've just gone through A division and I've got er a pile of cards literally an inch thick with people a made an initial inquiry or b they've been furnished with questionnaires and not been returned, so I'm sending those er right through the divisions
Mm
That's the task of the moment, in between the everyday work.
Mm, yeah
Then of course there's this insurance thing to do as well when David's er free and sorted out
Yeah well it's  a lot of that
Yeah, at least we'll end up with a scheme that's up-to-date and accurate
Yeah
Well we could also from that by photocopying the er the addresses erm and sending these letters out we might well get updated on the schemes anyway 
That er a scheme isn't operating
What about 
computerisation of the system to come back to us every twelve months if no contact
Eventually, yes.
Eventually yes.
I think we only want to be on the mainframe so that the divisions can access details in the middle of the night.
I think we still have priority at the moment to computers, in effect Paul is going to 
We might as well 
I still think we have to have the system as such, perhaps not so intricate, but certainly keep the file probably with the bits in
We might, cos you won't be able to put maps and things on them
Eh
But certainly the main co-ordinators er
Almost like the burglar alarm  you just have scheme, head co-ordinators, you know deputy co-ordinator, number of 'ouses and that just a basic so you go in
We we don't want really is street co-ordinators because
No
that'd be a mammoth task
If you have somebody like  somewhere like that
I'm not talking about that, I'm now talking about Tollerton but it's eight hundred properties, it's a small village but there are twenty seven street co-ordinators, so you know
Erm yeah so say all you need is just access to that field so if they do change you can just
At the moment you do I take it you're recording people who sort of ring up say I'm interested you send out a package to them you record them
Yes
I would think about giving up that, send the package out and forget about them
Well, this is something I've just done myself
Yeah
but I mean you send the package out and you get a phone call er it's Mr Davies, and then you get card out and then you send him the questionnaire it's merely a record duplicated on the form but
it's, I can't see any other way to do it at the moment, I mean probably when I
Yeah
think about it, but
I mean you don't start a file at that stage do you?
No just a card in er a pending tray and that's it
So you know who they are, yeah
Er a sheet of paper for Tracy to get the initial erm  out and then they just go through the system
And you also get sometimes two people off the same street
Well that's it
It's just a reference they want you  Mr Smith two doors away
Well I've had one for Basingfield or Basingfield
Oh I spoke to her, yeah
yeah, I've had three applications all for the it's only a small village albeit it's spread
and that's a 
You know for the er village
Well have you spoken to Sergeant  to alleviate all the paperwork, and
yeah yeah
and incur any additional expense
Three three farms and there's only te ten properties altogether in about two hundred yards
But they're building some more aren't they, building another seven
Building some, yeah building some massive houses there
and a Happy Eater as well 
Well that's it
Do they include that in the scheme, some of them on the rate, I won't bother with that anyway it's not our problem
yeah
Okay anybody
I've got one I meant to put on the main agenda and I forgot, and I wrote the agenda .
I've been offered the opportunity by er Bob  in training er in force  have taken this on er the tactical unit have taken it on, the chance of er one day erm assessment or appraisal training, at erm probably at Exeter for those of us that do it and erm I think that perhaps with the the way that the diverse way that our staff's spread out the proper ways of assessing people which I've I've never been shown how to do and I don't think many of us have.
Erm I mean he it sort of went through our staff inspector wise and er Paul was sort of chatting, and he wasn't being unkind he said yes, they'll be dinosaurs because it's a long time since you've had er any training like that.
What about civilian staff, I have to assess my staff, I haven't had no training.
yeah, yeah 
right, yeah 
I also said that erm my I expressed that the fears that I expressed at this meeting last time about er the fact that Paul and I now supervise civilian staff, er which I've never been sat down and told what the civilians term of contract are and what I can or cannot say or whatever, so erm I feel it will be quite valuable, and brought it for me to see if anybody think it's worthwhile pursuing.
A one day appraisal
Yes, it's a one day,
Just write it on a memo form Paul and send it round with a circulation slip, and those who feel they want to get involved put their name down, probably the quickest way of doing it.
Right, things are on hold though with assessments aren't they at the moment, cos they
aren't they always don't they change every ten minutes
I ain't got time to do assessments let alone a one day course.
Yeah, that's true.
I think that your two waiting for signature on his desk,
You haven't seen mine have you,
Well why do you want one, you've just bloody had one
No it's Derek 
First time he's said anything nice about me, I thought I'll get in while I can 
 
Derek, it won't last
Right, anyone else want to bring any points up
Took me, took me about bloody two days to do your last one
Stuart  is having a social event on the eleventh of March for the media and the police, I'll circulate this round with a er slip on it, erm it involves a conducted tour of the police station and some bits and bobs
oooh
And everyone's very welcome to come, I'll let you know
reply to it
Eleventh of March
Well it's now come under a general invited round to us all
Yeah
Eleventh of March, yeah
The  on the contacts slip so you can read at your leisure, anybody else want to raise any points, Tracy at all, David
About car park
Green vans, green vans
green vans
Are we
I'm gonna tell it
don't start
No, I've been and spoken to them again this morning and yesterday, R S C left it there not O S D although it's O S D's van, so they should've come out to move it on Friday and the mechanics didn't turn up, then they lost the keys, cos yesterday myself and who was it, Lyn, waited up for the keys cos they were gonna move down put it into a safer spot.
mm
Couldn't find the keys anywhere
Well they were hung up on the board in O S D on Friday when I went down there
Which which office?
In the a in the
No, you know you know as you're going down the corridor before you get to the doors to go down the next set of stairs, I mean in O S D, the last one is er for the P C that does all the man er you know all the duties and things like that, and in his office there's a great big board with all the vehicles on, and the key's hung up at the end and who's got 'em out, and the bottom one is that green van, because he went up and picked 'em up, when I was there.
I was coming to David
tomorrow morning if it's still there
yeah
yeah
We're not gonna put any  down cos it's going somewhere else
But they're gonna have to find him
Erm Bob  Bob 
No no no
You have to wait until all the transit vans are out and double parked put it across across the transit van bays
So nobody can get in at all 
Mm, or their transits
Let's throw the keys away


I was saying to David this morning there was a  on the police  that was good
probably terribly naive
oh it says something like J R Green a number which doesn't exist and any tradesperson could have the name address type of trade and a real phone number
course they would
yeah
You could change the signs quite regular though couldn't you
Painter and decorator one day and er butcher the  other 
Quite easily
throw, throw some paint over the back and everything  paint running out the back
Mm yeah
detail like that
Hear that
rubbish really, not our problem, anybody else want to bring any points up
No no
We've got dates for the meeting, I've got two suggestions, one is that I can't see any point anymore why
here here
and it's  to one
yeah, here here
better headquarters,
yeah, where where
S thirty one, if we book it in advance we can get in S thirty one downstairs  in the canteen, cos we're only an hour and half, two hours meeting
yeah
We can be finished by quarter to twelve
Good idea, any items of agenda for Sergeant , who will be organising the next meeting in S thirty one
Okay yeah fine twenty eighth of March
Hang on
He's on holiday
bloody right
The meetings 
coming for comments like that
There's an S L O's meeting on the twenty eighth of March
Oh good I'm in Majorca
Are we gonna do dates now or I think we regard the deputies visit as a special visit and
Mm
yeah
I mean I think the thing to do I mean we most of our lot are within the corridor, what we need to do is get headquarters find out when the rooms free and ring everybody round
Can you organise that 
Yeah I'll find it
Yeah, if you go up to that door 
Yeah well fifteenth March what day is it Tuesday?
There there's some dates on there
No fifteenth of March is out.
Silly bugger
Wednesday it's a Tuesday
Fifteenth of March
twenty second of March
It's much easier with a cal diary
Okay for that one
What twenty second of March, is that too far ahead?
Right twenty second if there's any difficulty I'll come back to Paul and Keith cos to let everybody else know about any problems
S thirty one is it
Well yes
S thirty one
Well
Do you think it's
Do you not think it's worthwhile booking the rest of the year's meetings or shall we do it as we carry on
What you mean going to find a room
I'm bored now
Are we closing the meetings 
Yeah we're all bored
The meeting's closing just before ten thirty thank you.
The sun has now risen the sun is over the yard arm.
