Jenny's didn't come out very well.
Didn't she?
No couldn't really  hear very well.
Will I listen?
No not now I'm going to put it away.

I wasn't really expecting to go into Jenny's.
No  I suppose she felt pretty awful about not inviting Amy to the party.
Yes.
She might do.
Pardon?
I don't think she expected a present 
Why why didn't she?
Well I think that Amy didn't go to Lucy's party I think
Pardon?
I think if you didn't go to Lucy's party I don't think.
Jenny was expecting a present.
From what's come in.
She looked a bit surprised didn't she?
Yes hmm
You know  she'd rather do Chimneys or something tomorrow than London Zoo.
Pardon?
We rather go to Chimney's tomorrow than to London Zoo.
Oh.
I was asking.
Would you?
Probably.
Yeah.
to London Zoo.
Don't you like London Zoo particularly?
I don't  Clare doesn't really like going round all the creatures do you?
What?
Would you like go .
Might not be right.
I would quite like to go to Chimneys actually.
It's not too far aways.
No it's easier.
But it's easier if you got tact.
Why 
It's easier if you've got tact tomorrow
Mm  Why?
Well  because tac doesn't finish till till half past twelve.
Don't you  got one of those 
Don't know how they've decided whose has got one.
Decide what?
Could be just our way.
I don't know how they decided who's got one 
Do you think it's worth twenty five pounds?
That must be it 
You can't get too many people doing it unless Marks and Spencers  free.
I don't think Marks and Spencers will give them free.
Twenty five pounds?
Did you like Amy's  suit?
Not very much but I 
Do you know what you can wear underneath it?
I think you're supposed to wear a T-shirt.
It's a bit cold.
Hmm.
I was just reading that.
Peter.
Huh?
Who did Eve have on her plate  Amy?
Mrs Tiggywickle.
Who did Eve have on her plate?
Plate?
Mrs Tiggywinkle.

You'd better read a chapter before we go out this afternoon.
He's got a musical test which says don't they're tired they're tired and then he said the pig says I'm not  and then the people said Oh dear and then he said I'm hungry and then they said they're hungry and he says I'm not and he's sleepy .
I don't like  story.
She read that to me.
It was quite easy um I read it again to her .
It was quite a good reason really.
Well I think Jenny's um sort of 
We've never had hardly seen it before because I haven't lawn in that book before have I?
You haven't had what?
Lawn.
Ah.
The word you mean?
Yes.
Ah.
Perhaps not.

Yeah.
Is Jenny quite happy at the moment she's going to

She hasn't got much of a choice for what?
Where Amy's going or you've got to go there and you  think of the positive   When's their they've had their open day or is there another one?

Hmm.
Mm.
Out of the other ones  white if there was  I would have chosen white.
I would have chosen red.
Don't you like red?
No not much.
I like yellow that's my second favourite colour.
Nice bright colour.
my favourite's that
That's a lovely pink isn't it?
Mm.
I like that pink  I like peach as well

Ask him.
Mummy that's like an 
Yes not with your mouth full 
 

Can I have another cutlet?
That's your third.
I know.
So you'd like a film for your camera.
Yes please.
I should think that Mr Staton would put it in for you wouldn't he?
Yeah.
Um
There's a competition for the best photograph
Oh well you'd better take your camera then.
Amy you can have that other little one if you like.
Would you like that for your holiday?
Yes please.
I'd like it now for my .
Hmm you may have that one.
Pardon?
You may have that one.
Pardon?
You can have that one.
Are we having a boat rip around the needles?
Hmm.
I might take one of the needles.
Well take a few photographs.
Yes
I mean don't forget.
You're usually hopeless
All right.
I'll put it in my back pack.
And take a photograph of everybody  as you set off.
Mr Staton always takes a group one so if you say just a minute I'd like one too.
I'll get pictures of Mrs.  just about to fall in the sea or something  
Just about what?
And then Mr Staton asleep on the lake or something
You'd be lucky to find one of Mr Statton asleep
 

I don't think he's going to go to sleep while he's in charge of thirty of you.
Then  here you are just 
Is he in charge?
He's in charge, yes.
He's Head Master.
What comes if someone's ill?
I suppose there are bound to be a couple of people.
I don't know.
Maybe if you really are they'll send you home.
On your own?
No.
One of the staff would have to come with you.
Not that  one of the  that couple.
Yeah
You can't ring the doctors on the Isle of White.
Oh if you have been really ill 
I should think the one's whose most vulnerable is Clare Montgomery.
She's just had her operation.
I'm surprised she's still going on it so soon after.
She gets a cough.
If by any chance she catches it off me she's going to have a really sore throat isn't she?
I think she wants to go.
I don't think anybody wants to be left behind.
take more crisps.
No I think you've had enough.
Oh I've only had a few.
I didn't have many did I?
No.
Don't know really.
I'm quite looking forward to it.
You know er you get your packet money each day and you can buy things.
But I'm not over keen on nuts.
Good fun .
I think if Mr. Statton says you'll be so tired  would you like to go and get your reading book and get a hanky and 
You get prizes afterwards so that er one had the best kept room and another one
Can you get a hanky?
Where have you come?
About five are the best people to live with.
You might get one from happiest.
Happiest me?
If I wake up with ear ache that's
There isn't any?
Aren't there?
No.
Is the box not in there or is the box empty?
The box is empty.
Is it?
Hmm hmm.

Suddenly they heard a quiet noise

Neither of you have thrown either of your old hankie boxes away.
Amy keeps getting mine out of the bin.
Well  erm throw them in the bin down outside erm  you got a two hundred.
Why why can you put it on different things?
Well you can have different  fims .
I thought it might be easier to get you what you've got in already  you've still got tea round your mouth and have you cleaned your teeth cause they weren't very clean um  you could take Tom's midnight garden with you 


Oh you're not going in your earrings
Oh mummy I never wear them otherwise.

You get two pounds a day .
You can save it
What on earth did you put in your pockets?
Oh goodness knows.

Have you got my hankies?
Oh I've just thrown a whole load of screwed up ones out.
Go and get a few more.
Remind me we must get some handkies.
Are you putting a coat on Clare or are you going like that?
Let's hope we can find a parking space.
Right.
Is that everything.
So you want a film and you want a back pack.
And you want a
I don't need a very big back pack because all it's got to carry is my 
It's got to carry your lunch hasn't it?
My lunch  and my camera.
And a box and a
Fits me doesn't it?
If I put my camera in the front 
Come on.

No France here.
Well it says jeans and a jumper or trousers and a jumper.

Yeah.
You going to take your white trousers?
Your new white ones?
Are you going to wear those at the disco?
Yes.
Rather than your black ones?
Yes.
I thought you could probably take both.
I don't think it's been very erm generous with out of school wear but you can change when you get back.
I think you'd better take your Scots Park jumper and your red cardigan in case you manage to spill
yes
all your dinner down your Scotch Park jumper or something
Yeah
because you haven't got two.
 

Well you've got that one that Daddy put on in the wash and washed too hot.
Yeah

He's just  he's just got one  a long way out though  right looks as though we've either just missed one and they Oh no they are just coming aren't they?just missed one there 
There's one
Oh just missed one  Oh no he's he's going in.

No a bit bigger  seems to me if we'd moved up a bit we would have had a bit more room.
exactly.
a large space here.
Pardon?
They haven't given me a very large space.
It's probably why it's left.

Shall we go there first?
Yes.
Do you want a new washing bag and a salon to take with you or are you not bothered?
Mm?
I've got plenty.
You can't take mine.
You can't have Amy's.
You've only got the one.
What?
Oh nothing.
I just thought you'd like a new one.
Oh right.
In that case.
All we've got to have is
Well I certainly wouldn't bother taking any shampoo if you can't have a hair drier.
Well Charlie'll have to so we can all wash our hair.

.
Well I'll should take, I mean hopefully you won't have a cold.

Well then your better putting it back to the back place first.

It's alright, cos it's very, that's very difficult .
I can do that holding the edge actually, have to hold the tall side.
Right, put them in the, doesn't even fit on very well.
Oh no,.
I can't see what I'm doing even.
I mean that's a silly place to put it Amy.
I can't find any where else to put it .
Well why don't you put it on the table or on the little table, it doesn't even fit on that shelf, does it?
It's too big.
You can't really have that and these plates on that shelf.
Oh ok, I'll have it on the little table, but I want you to do it, not me.
Alright, well.
It's always falling .
On the little table it'll fit, and you can put the cups .
That's what I said .
Cups and saucers on, well you can do that, look you can do that better than I can.
Here you are, there, it's on the little table, now you put the cups and saucers on it.
Ok, it doesn't matter they can stay .
Go on, you can do those better than I can.
That, that goes in the middle.
There, but your trying to balance something that won't even balance properly.
Where's the other cup?

I don't think we need to make any more buns yet.

Alright.
Yeah.
Ok.
What kind of cake, chocolate?
Hm, if you want.
I would like normal.
Oh we always have normal.

Oh, I don't know my order, I don't.
What d'you like best mummy?

It's worth it strawberry moose.
Over the gas.
Over the gas?
Hm, you have to beat it in a pan of boiling water.

The egg yolks and the strawberries and the sugar.
Oh, there lovely mixture, to watching boiling water.
Hm, trouble is it tends to come over the top of the bowl..
Ah.

I didn't know you put them, glass on  gas.
No you don't, you put the saucepan with some water in it, you boil that and put the bowl mixture in  in the saucepan.
Oh right.
Your just boiling water round the outside.

You put your pan with some boiling water in and then you put the bowl with all the stuff in on top.
I just thought it was grass.
In the pan .
No, glass.
Oh glass, I thought you said grass,.
What happens if you put boiling water on glass?
Nothing, depends what sort of glass it is.
If you pour boiling water on ordinary glass it will probably crack.

If you fill a milk bottle with boiling water I would think it would crack, might do.
And a cup?
Pyrex is alright.

That's my bowls are made off.
Is that real glass or is it?
I don't know what they do to it, but it's a stand the temperature much better.

Pyrex.
It's glass of a sort, but I don't know what, I don't know what they do to make it much more heat resistant, you can put it in the oven.
Can you?
Oh yeah, that casserole tops Pyrex.
Is it?
I thought that was plastic.
If that was plastic it would melt.
No.
In the oven.

Come on Clare could you do that? and then you can go and get your stuff in from outside.

Well, then I'll boil that side won't I? with all the cuts, right, mix that round if you like.

I don't think you can both stir it at the same time.
Amy..
Oh come on, you can't both stir it, I'm going to get very cross, I'm too tired for this.
.
Now let Clare stir it for a bit and then let Amy have a turn, but don't slop it every where, or else you won't have a.
What've you been doing all day today?.
Well we've been, I mean we were at Jenny's for a while, I went to the bank and eh, then we've been into Bromley all afternoon.
.
Shopping.

Well stuff for Clare for the Isle of Wight really.
.
She needed a back pack and she needed some soap and a tooth travelling tooth brush, eh, yes that looks alright, knock  knock it of the.
Can you get me a spoon please.
.
Eh a knife I think.
Pardon.
A knife I think.
.
I'll do it 
That's about all really, nothing very exciting, I mean we were probably at Jenny's an hour.
.
Erm, there's a sort of shop in the mall that sort of sells, oh it, it does key cutting and heeling and stuff, we got one from there in the end.
We had a look in Salisbury's but she didn't like any of them there.
There so expensive.
Now what shall we do?
You can wash the erm, the beaters, and you can put the cream next to the other bowl and I'll mix them altogether when I've got the lemon juice in.

Oh Clare you have, tt.

Go on put the cream down, you don't wonder around with that.
Put it down here.
Oh come on.
I didn't mean to.
Well, would you like to wash and dry your hair?
Oh come on I'm tired .
Look what's Clare done .
Sorry.
Right.
.
Right, well would you like to go up and run Amy a bath then please, cos I haven't got this finished and.
What's this?
Oh my dress I need to shorten it.
Look!
Clare you were asked to run a bath that doesn't mean to say you go across the landing six times, just run her a bath and Amy will you get in it and then come down Clare.
I know,.
I'm tired and I don't want to cope with you, otherwise you both go to bed this minute.
What did you say?
I said you run her a bath.
I am .
And then , well why is you clumpering across the landing six or seven times?
Why all the screams?
I'm tired.
screaming.
Well just run her a bath and then come down.
If you don't, you go to bed.
Alright, here you are.
Mummy.
What?
Do you go up to half term and .
What's half term?
Well your on half term now aren't you?
Oh, well I can't just have lots of terms, half terms, cos the next one half term.
Half what?.
And then there's a lot more.
What are you talking about?
You have a term and then in a middle of the term you have a half term don't you?
Then you have a nice place.
Well.
Go home.
Well I don't know whether you go home from boarding school, you probably just have a day off, I don't know, I haven't been to boarding school.
Right, were do we get, sharp words .
The spider affair as it was called went all over the school before the day was out, it caused a great deal of laughter.
When mother, Mams Arougeaye heard of it she sneered.
To think that a French woman should be so foolish she said, though I didn't like spiders or earwigs or moths or even snakes.
 Mams Audyponch should be ashamed to make her exhibition of herself.
The first form talked about it more than any one else, of course they squealed with laughter when they saw the poor Mary Lou Manselle and Gwendoline, all falling victims to the same spider, jolly clever spider said Irene, it means the only three people in the form that it  that would be scared of it, I take my hat off to that spider, can't think why it chose my desk said Mary Lou, no, that was a shame said Gwendoline, poor Mary Lou it must of been an awful shock for you when you saw it, I wonder who put it there?
There was a silence for the first time it occurred to first form that the spider might of been put there on purpose, they looked at one another.
It was a dirty trick to put it into to poor Mary Lou's desk said Jean, she can't help being scared of things I suppose, she almost jumped out of her skin when she saw it, I should of thought any joker in our form would of been decent enough to popped it into say Alicia's desk, not if it happened to be Alicia who popped it in said a sly voice, you do so love playing tricks don't you Alicia?
You and Daryl where in the first form room before afternoon school and I'm sure we'll all remember you saying you'd like to put a spider down Mary Lou's neck.
It was Gwendoline speaking, Alicia glanced at her, well I didn't do it she says, nor did Daryl, sorry to disappoint you darling Gwendoline, Mary, but we just didn't, if it was any one I should think it was you.
Mary Lou's my friend said Gwendoline, I wouldn't do that to her.
Well if you've almost drowned her one week I should think you could quite well bring yourself to put a spider in her desk the next week said Daryl.
It's pretty funny that you and Alicia were the only ones in the classroom before afternoon school persisted Gwendoline angry that no one seemed to agree with her suggestion.
Shut up said Catherine shortly, we know it wasn't Daryl or Alicia because they say so.
The spider must of got in there by accident and that's that.
Well I think began Gwendoline that the class took  at once.
Be quite Gwendoline, Gwendoline shut up, shut up Gwendoline, Gwendoline shut up.
There was nothing to do but to shut up, Gwendoline was sulking exasperated.
It had been such a good idea and all that had resulted from it was a double punishment for her and a complete failure to make anyone believe to Alicia or Daryl had played the trick.
True the first formers had had to go to bed an hour earlier, but they all voted it was worth it, Gwendoline felt vicious about the whole affair, she'd determining not to be put off by her first day there .
What  erm hours early.
She did.
She determine not to be put off by her first failure, but to go on doing things to Mary Lou so that in the end the class would have to put the tricks down to Alicia and Daryl.
She thought she would also hint to Miss Potts that Alicia and Daryl were at the bottom of things, but she didn't get very far with this, she had to go and see Miss Potts about some returned homework.
She stood very neatly beside her in the little room that Miss Potts shared with Mams Audiponde at North Tower.
Miss Potts I was awfully sorry about that spider affair the other day, she began, of course Alicia and Daryl were in the classroom before hand, I'm sure they know something about it, I heard Alicia say, Miss Potts looked up, are you trying to sneak she said, or in more polite language to tell tales, because if so, don't try it on me.
At the boarding school I went to Gwendoline we had a very good punishment for sneaks, all the girls in the sneak dormy gave her one good spank with the back of a hair brush.
You may have a lot of interesting things to tell me, but it's no use expecting me to listen.
I wonder if the girls here out the same punishment for sneaks, I must ask them.
Gwendoline went flaming red, as sneaks, fancy Miss Potts daring to call her that.
Gwendoline Mary Lacy a sneak, all because she just wanted to drop a kindly hint, Gwendoline didn't no what to say she felt as if she'd like to burst into tears, but Miss Potts always got very impatient with girls who did that.
She went out of the room longing to slam the door as she often did at home, but she didn't dare to here.
She felt very sorry for herself, if her mother new what an awful school she'd come to she would take her away at once, Miss Winter too would be horrified.
But Gwendoline wasn't quite so sure about her father, he can say things at times very like Miss Potts said.
The week went by, it was a very pleasant week, hot with a cool breeze that made games and swimming even more pleasant than usual, Alicia and Betty were practising hard for the school sport, both were excellent swimmers and divers .
That's what I use.
That's not very nice is it .
Hm no, well try not to keep banging it.
It does on her and it's quite sharp.
Oh dear.
Daryl tried to imitate all they did, she was good to, but not quite so good as they were, but she was quite fearless and divide of the highest diving board and went down a chute in all kinds of peculiar position.
The only unhappy person that week was Mary Lou.
She'd got into a lot of trouble over many little things, for instance, her clothes in the changing room were being thrown down in a pool of water, and was soaking wet, she had to take them to matron to be dried, matron was cross.
Mary Lou can't you hang your things up properly in that changing room?
You know there always puddles of water on the floor from the girls coming in and out of the pool.
I did hang them up matron said Mary Lou mildly, I know I did, then Mary Lou's tennis racket sudden showed three broken strings, they were not frayed, but looked as if they've been cut, Mary Lou was upset.
My new racket she said, look Gwendoline, who would think a new racket would go like that.
It couldn't said Gwendoline pretending to examine it very closely, those strings have been cut Mary Lou someone's been playing a trick on you, what a shame.
Mary Lou was miserable, she couldn't believe she had any enemy's, for when she found buttons cut off on her Sunday dress, she new someone was being unkind and mean, Gwendoline comforted her.
Never mind I'll sew them on for you, I hate sewing but I'll do it for you Mary Lou.
. So making a great show of it Gwendoline sowed on the six blue buttons one night.
The first former's stared at her in surprise, they knew she never mended any thing if she could help it.
How did those buttons come off asked Jean?
That's what I'd like to know said Gwendoline smugly, six buttons all ripped off I'm putting them on for Mary Lou because I'm so sorry any one should play at such a dirty trick.
I'd like to know who cut the strings of her tennis racket too, the first formers looked at one another, it certainly is queer the way things have been happening to poor Mary Lou lately, even her prayer book had disappeared and some of her pencils had gone.
True there'd been found in Alicia's desk, but everyone thought that was just an accident, now they began to wonder if someone had put them there, not Alicia, Lizzie wouldn't do a thing like that, but somebody, it was getting near half term and new the girls were excited because some of them were expecting visits from there parents.
Any parent who lived  not to far away would be sure to come.
Daryl  because her father and mother were coming.
They lived a long way away, but they decided to take a weeks holiday in Cornwall and decided to see Daryl in the middle of it.
The girls began to talk about there families, I wish my three brothers could come said Alicia, we'd have some sport then.
I wished my little sister could come said Jean, I'd love to show her Mallory Towers.
Is your mother coming Sally asked Mary Lou?
No said Sally she lives too far away.
Daryl remembered something your mother had told her in a letter a week or two before, she said that she'd met Sally Hopes mother and had liked her and she said to that she'd seen Mrs Hopes baby.
Who?.
Sally.
Sally's sister a little girl of three months, Daryl had meant to tell Sally what her mother had said and had forgotten and now she remembered.
Oh Sally I expect your mother won't come because of the baby she said.
Sally went stiff, she stared at Daryl as if she couldn't believe her ears, her face went quite white.
When she spoke she sounded as if she was chocking.
You don't know what your talking about she said, what baby? we haven't a baby, my mother won't be coming because it so far I tell you.
Daryl was puzzled, but Sally don't be silly my mother says in a letter she's seen your baby sister she's three months old she said.
I haven't got a baby sister said Sally in a low  queer voice, I'm the only one, mother and I have been everything to each other, daddy has to go, go away such a lot, I haven't got a baby sister.
. Girls looked at Sally curiously, whatever could be the matter with her she sounded so queer.
Oh right said Daryl and Elsie you ought to know I suppose any way, I'd suspect you'd like a sister, it's nice having one.
I should hate a sister said Sally, I wouldn't share my mother with anyone, she walked out of the room her face as wooden as ever, the girls were really puzzled, she's a funny one said Irene, hardly ever says anything, all closed up, somehow, but sometimes those closed up people burst open suddenly and then look out, well I'll shall certainly write and tell mother she's mistaken said Daryl and she did so.
Then the mesh, she told Sally the next time she saw her, I'm sorry I made that mistake about you having a sister she said to Sally, I've written to tell mother you've said you haven't one she must of been mistaken what your mother said.
Sally stood still and gazed, glared at Daryl as if she suddenly hated her.
What you want to go interfering for she burst out, leave me and my family alone, little busy body always sticking your nose into other people's affairs, Daryl's temper flared up, I don't she said, you gua rd your tongue Sally, I never meant to interfere and I can't think what all the fuss is about, either you have a sister or you haven't, I don't care.
You tell your mother not to interfere either said Sally, writing letters about my family.
Oh don't be so silly flared back Daryl really exasperated now, any one would think there was a deep dark mystery the way you go on, any way I'll just see what my mother says when she next writes to me and I'll tell you.
I don't want to know, I won't know said Sally as she put her hands  put out her hands as if she was fending Daryl off, I hate you Daryl Rivers, you with, you with your mother who comes to see you often, sends you things and writes you long letters and comes to see you.
You boast about that to me you do it all on purpose, your mean, mean, mean.
. Daryl was utterly taken about, what in the wide world did Sally mean, she watched the girl go out of the room and sat down on the form completely bewildered.
Right, half term at last.
Half term at last.
Hm.
Right teeth cleaned at least I think.
Come on.
Teeth cleaned at last.

.
No, no, muggins, muggins does, but.
You don't need, he, that sort of thing that turns you on or.
No, I wouldn't be on the committee, no, cos I could never guarantee he'll be home.

No it's to much of a, I hate saying I'll go out at eight o'clock and tell him to be home and at quarter too eight he hasn't come and oh, I'm to tired really, but, so I've always played it that I will help when I  when I can, but uhum, I don't go on the committee, cos then your stuck, you've got to go.
Oh yeah, well you can only .
That's right, yeah, so .
Years, obviously you get roped into .
To do all the things whether you feel like it or not, oh no, I usually take a back seat and then when it's , I'm .
Well, well it's usually time to do it.
Yeah, I mean I do a stall and everything at the summer fair and stuff.
Well they often ask her, I mean  .
They usually want volunteers, yeah .
They're a hand short or, or there is functions then obviously there are .
That's, that's more my style and then you know you're doing something or you not, you, you don't have to and if you're around, yes we got  oh pages of it from Bromley High the other day.
What uniform and stuff?
Uniform and swimming club and flute.
Yeah.

Grey and pink it said.
pinky  .
Yes, I haven't seen it though, I haven't, I've heard of the new ones but I haven't seen it.
It must be a shell suit I think.
No, it says optional, I think it'll be very optional for us at the moment.
Uhum I mean she don't have to have it .
Especially the way there getting .
And they grow quickly, I mean it sort of.
When there growing quickly .
Yeah.
I mean it's sort of shooting up every other term aren't they?

Yeah,, I  they never give you date, yeah .
.
Oh, right, well,.
In wonderful condition.
Well that's it.
They grow out of it quickly .
Uhum, I mean  .
I mean if you buy, put your foot down .
Quarter of an inch or so, I couldn't believe it, you know .
No, no, especially if you've only got one daughter and it only goes threw once and, I mean the list is so long.
.
Yeah.
I, I have to look at the  I mean we looked at it when it first came through, when all our originals .
When do you get all you know, all the cookery aprons and the.
Yeah, science overalls.
Science aprons and then the shorts for athletics and the swimming costume.
It must of cost quite a piece cos it obviously .
Yeah, swimming .
Yeah, yeah.
It's better to have that then eh to ruin the .
Oh yeah, but I mean it just goes on when you need it all new.
Oh yes, yes, you, oh yes, I have.
I think it's very kind of the uhum .
Well it's on the second of Jan  July.
Yeah.
When were here, so, yeah, oh I shall go and see what bargains I can get here, eh.
I've done it before.
Yeah, cos eh, that'll be good.
Yes, I might, I might pop in and .
I saw a blazer that was going in the sale couple of weeks ago and I, I said.
Yes, I missed the date, I missed the date of the last one  .
I mean it's absolutely immaculate , I mean you, you sell it brand new from a shop, I agree yeah.
Yeah, well that's it basically.
It was a very small one, but it, you know.
They often don't wear them that much, so.
I think they  had a price on, it was something like,.
Hm.
I think they put there own price though, I don't know how they do it.
Probably.
.
Yeah, then you better pricing it low and getting rid of it then too high and.
.
Yes, I think we'll have to have  have a good look, yes it's alright when you've got a few things to get, but when when you've got the whole list.
Ding, dong, ding, dong.
It's a bit sort of horrific, but eh.
Why don't you .
I think it's more than that for the seniors.
.
.
I think.
.
Seventy five I think, yeah, seventy five I think they were paying for the.
You've got to get,.
You have no choice.
.
Oh, oh well they have said grey coat from anywhere, just a long grey coat, uhum.
.
Yes, what was it, then they said white blouses, just open neck.
Not necessarily .
No, no.
.
The skirt is definite, you know, so many pleats, uhum, so obviously that is and the blazer's static, but quite a lot of it seemed to be fairly, you know, instead of grey, either the school track suit or just a grey track suit, so uhum, which it is, it's all these little bits like .
Yeah.
Hockey stick .
.
Oh yes, trainer, what am I thinking, oh lovely, yes well I'm a.
You do it all bit by bit, if you do it all in one fail swoop, you think oh my .
Bits  yes well Georgina round the corner apparently she has the lot new, because the bank moved them and they paid her and it was over four hundred pounds.
Oh I can believe that.
Yeah..
Keep working.

Probably when there at tap.
Well I mean, it's, it's, if your  I think perhaps Clare's age .
Yeah, there to young.

I think British Gas profits are unbelievable.
They er .
Yeah, they buy gas at eighteen P and they sell it for forty three P.
vast profit  and then they .
How come, I mean, why does the big discrepancy?
Why that's what they're charging, never mind the discrepancy.
Who sells it to them at eighteen P?
The oil company.
The oil company.
So why are they allowed to charge forty three P to the consumers?
They're a monopoly aren't they?
I mean what do they do to it to justify charging any more?.
Don't do anything to it.
No,.
Deliver it to your home  Well, what I  to is the erm, getting involved in .
Cos with British Gas you can't .

Thought you had to put the weight on by law?
Fright in asking what   Somebody  erm, sell all the stuff, sell .
I wouldn't of thought they needed to.
They don't need to, but, erm, I mean nine, ninety eight per cent of their sales is on sale of gas, so the only way you can make a name for yourself is getting involved in things other than gas, one, installing central heating or kitchen .
talk about it.
The way British Gas get involved.
.
I mean their gas showrooms in the high street.
If you're running a business economically you wouldn't have those.
never anybody in them anyway.
No, but they weren't  for them, cos they, doesn't really matter, they've got so much pocket out of gas  But the Gas  is erm, make them increase prices at five per cent less than the rate of inflation that way .
they get rid of , saying that  privatised the price of gas is gone down fourteen per cent in the past .

It was like autumn, Pink the chaffinch was his friend, we hurry, so they flew off to a field where the corn had been thrashed.
Threshed.
What's threshed?
Mm, I think it's been cut and, they have to stretch it to get the actual bits of corn out of the middle of the seed, don't want the husk.
Threshed , in the , E, E, A, S.
In the heat.
Heat of chaff.
Chaff?
Mm, that's what the outside of the grain of corn is called.

They had all the grain of which they needed for a good breakfast to finish

off the meal they eat some .

of white of his wings.
On his wings.
Mm, and when he blew he showed off more white feathers in his tail and little hen chaffinch always keeps near to Pink.
She was quite dark, she had no rosy breast and not a song worth, what's that say?
Not a song worth
Worth singing.
Pink took at very little boy not 
notice.
notice of her, who's Pink?
The chaffinch isn't it?
Why's he called Pink?
Mm?
I didn't know he was called Pink.
Ah, winter came and it rain much colder, snow fell and covered everything Pink

Kind people put out for them, they were expecting
Especially.
especially glad when people put out dishes of water.
Why?
everything is frozen over they don't get any water do they?


Oh it's a long story that one.
Mm, I want to read all of it.
Pink's beautiful feathers grow dull, why did they grow dull?
Again he's probably not eating the right things.
And dirty in all the rain and fog.
He longed for the white spring days, at last the morning were light
At last the mornings were lighter.
were lighter.
The  began to see to each other, I believe winter has gone, some of the days were quite warm and Pink started to pressured?
To practice.
Practice the song he knew.
They were not very good at the, he had forgotten all the best bits.
Then it really was spring the apples orchard was in flower.
Pink, Pink shouted the chaffinches to each other, oh Pink what a day
What a lazy.

All through.
through the day, his
Call.
call rang out.
Why did they have pink on it, that's why it's called Pink?
Mm.
That's why he's called Pink, I think.
He loved bathing.
Bathing.
Oh bath  bathing.
Well it's called bathing isn't it?
You don't say I'm going to have a bathing.
I'm going bath, I'm going bathing.
Bathing to the winter fog.
Did you find it?
Yes.
He made his feathers dirty so he liked
So he looked.
For.
for one of those deep puddles made by the spring rain.
He dripped his
He dipped.
he, he dipped his head, that's what I said
Mm.
under the splash
Under and splashed.
the water all over his self with the wings, with his wings, then he flew up into a tree to tie
Tidy.
tidy his feathers and dry in the sun.
His feather grow white every day until his breast was a good all colour.
Pink thought to himself I very fine bird.
He, and, he wanted a friend to admire him 
Mm, good girl.
and listened to his songs, he every
He even.
He  thought of making a nest
I think that's for little babies isn't it?
Yeah.
What you say?
He  lady.
They're not the same birds
Mm, I think they're supposed to be.
cos that ones horrible and dirty with
Well that's the lady bird and they're never so pretty as the men birds.
Aren't they?
No, not the birds.
Why?
It's always men that have the pretty colours.
Are you going to read this page?
One day he remembered the hen chaffinch thought
That.
that had flower
That had flown.
flown with him in the nest
In the.
in the winter and
She.
she was nice so, she would admire his fine colours and did not seem much herself, so, she wanted
So she would.
would listen to him, she is a wife I want Pink thought.
Thought Pink, the little hen was pleased, she too wanted to make a nest.
Pink took her to the garden and showed her the rose arch.
Mm.
Look, oh yes that's it, dear.
Look my dear.
My dear, he said, this seems a good place for a nest.
Why does it seem a good place for a nest?.
Don't think she thinks much of it.
He no  nobody
Nodded.
Nobody
She nodded.
nodded but looked at an apple tree over the hedge.
The next day they began to build the nest in the apple tree.
Is that the apple tree?
No, here's the apple tree, I think that's the rose arch, but she didn't think that was such a good idea, and she was probably quite right.
Pardon?
She was probably quite right.
This one .
Yeah, here we are.
The little hen worked all day getting moss and wood and bind up those
These.
These  put in a heap with
Where.
where two branches met.
When they
When they're.
there were
Enough.
enough to set it
She sat.
there was enough, she  she sat in flat  of it and pushed herself r round and round, soon then there was .
Was shaped.
shaped like a cup with bright
She bought, brought.
she brought more moss still and pressed into shape with in the same way.
Turning herself round and round 
Have we nearly finished?
Yes you nearly finished.
Good.
Mm.
I wish you wouldn't keep trying
Turning.
turning round and round like that said Pink.
You make me feel quite dizzy.
Don't watch then she answered chaffinch
Cheerfully.
cheerfully, why don't you sit in the tree and sing to me, when all the moss and, was in place the  chaffinch went to find her hair.
Horse hair 
Horse hair.
What's horse hair?
What, horse hair from the horses tail I should think.
Horse hair.
Horse hair for lying
For the lining.
lining the inside of the nest.
What's that?
Can I keep 
Mm, make it nice and soft I should think.
It's beautiful sang Pink, how well it shows up Greg's

Well cos then it will be obvious and cats might come up and get the eggs or something.
it must do.
It mustn't do that.
Do that.
She doesn't want it to show up.
Why, he looks a bit sad.
I don't think he's doing very much do you?
No.
I think he's letting his wife do all the work.
Yes.
She flew to an old gate and picked

Need watering a bit, have those back up there and  really you seem even worse than  oh were going to go and do your bedroom.
Try and get that drink drunk.
Yep  do we want the stuff to fill the holes with?
I don't know whether we did really to be honest, don't worry,.
Poly filler.
Poly filler and eh.

With the uhum, the putty knife.
Oh right.
.
Yeah.
I said the putty knife.
What's the putty knife?
flat .
What, that one?
.
Well I don't know, I don't know where your putty knife is.
It's .
It's the what?
Have too guess.
Well I don't know, they all look the same to me.
I'm a bit upset if she's not very well though.
Seems to happen.
She's was alright .
Hm,very well on Thursday.
No she wasn't.
No.
And then she perked up in the evening, I think she wanted to play tennis and then she was alright Friday.
I don't like these things that you don't seem to get rid off and they just come back when you least want them.
Hm .
I was very glad were not, we  we could easily of been going to  tonight.
Hm 
We want the tape measure won't we?
We must of have plenty of pencils up here I would think.
have we got the  we haven't got the thing to draw a straight line have we?
Is that.
That's in the, that's in the box in the corner.
What in that bluey  what the box  a box or uhum in your little cupboard.
Hm in the kitchen cupboard.
Yeah.
Oh it's quite useful that Half a Sixpence is on.
Yeah, they both watching it?
No Amy won't watch television.
What she doing?
Playing with her marbles.
Right .
I must get round to getting end of  uhum  curtain material.
Yeah .
Yes, I quite like that pink and white stripe one.
I quite like somewhere I could get uhum a cover for the bed to match.
Look quite nice wouldn't it?
.
We'd better measure it on the other wall, hadn't we?
It'll be wet.
Yeah .
Let's see.
Tape measures there some where.
So we have to do that.
Oh better measure other.
What's it twenty one?
Twenty and a half.
.
uhum, couldn't you go up in the other corner.
.
I can't cos that's left handed for me.
.
I can work that way, I've got to go the other way.
.
Can't you unhook it?
Does it unhook at the end?
get the right length .
And then it goes up  under any way.
Twenty should be alright and just half an inch to go round the corner.
Well it's certainly different paper.
Yeah.
Hm  But it's quite good paper because it's got all the colours in it so you could put any thing with it can't you?
Yeah .
I didn't think .
You thought this was a big bedroom till you started trying to get.
.
Amy Johnson's a funny little one.
She was a,going to see Joseph's.
Yeah.
Dream Coat next week end.
Yeah.
And she said, with Jason Donovan, I said oh do you like Jason Donovan? she said oh yes I've seen that with Jason Donovan.
Oh she said I've seen Jason Donovan in that, so I said well I don't think you have cos it didn't start till today.
Yeah.
I have, I saw it a while ago with daddy.
Yeah.
I said yes, but I don't think it was actually Jason Donovan, oh it was, yes, it was Jason Donovan and I've got the paper  all  along, I give up in the end .
Yeah 
Very definite young lady .
Is she?.
Oh yes, ooh she wasn't going to have it that we were going to see it, cos she hasn't seen that particular one.
Do they, get on alright together?
Well, yes I think so.
Yeah.
I don't think Amy Johnson will be over pleased that she that Amy get's better than she is , no.
She is .
But Amy's very tactful so I just didn't say any thing.
Yeah.
No she's quite, well I told her not to.
I mean this, the children are two young to have there noses rub with it, especially Amy Johnson, that wouldn't go down well, but eh, she's quite good, she doesn't sort of.
.
Can you measure it down that one or.
Yeah.
Is it going to stick?.
.
You know what the
.
I presume that that's the top wouldn't you?
At the beginning of a roll, and I would almo 
In both ways or.
Yeah, I would almost say that  upside down, there seems to be more flowers going down than up don't they?
The pink ones going down, the blue ones going down.
.
Does it look better the other way up does it?
.
Don't you?
Yes.
I think the majority.
.
Alright.
.
Yeah, I think  some one way, some the other, look lovely.
.
Yeah.
It's not a very big pattern drops any rate.
It is different paper isn't it?
Yeah.
Thank you.
Her mummy was saying, you know Michelle, aunty Monica's daughter.
Yeah.
There in dire straights now.
.
Pardon?
In what respect, financially?
Yeah, they think there've got to sell the house and get out.
Why's that?
Why, they owe six thousand pounds on the various cards.
Cards?
Yeah, huh, I think there way behind on the mortgage.
does Michelle work?
Well she did work full time in London, but she said that was to much for her so she's, she didn't work at all, now she's gone back to work three days a week in Orpington I think.
She's got what, two children.
Yes, but Ross gave up his job as a uhum, he was in with the Leeds, which was a bit stupid because he must of got a cheaper mortgage I should think.
Yeah.
To become an insurance sales man.
Oh.
And of course I don't think he would do any good at it, his quite a quite, shy.
.
And I mean it's not easy at the moment any way, is it?
No.
Even for the pushiest  But I mean, they've  they were owing money years ago, they sort of said there having Christmas on Access.
oh it's a shame when you lose your house though isn't it?
Yep.
.
Yeah, this is the top.
Ah, I reckon that sticks a lot better, doesn't it?
be easier to tear I think.
Yeah, it's not very thick, well it's got no strength in it has it?
No.
But uhum, it sticks, whilst the other one just curls straight back up at the edges didn't it.
Yeah.
Dreadful.
But doing this, you know, what ever it's like, it, the other one was hopeless 
Be interesting this one.
Yeah, at least you get a bit more of a  how long you got a  you got a , I mean I couldn't cope with , I mean I'm not pleased with it now I've done it.
No.
Otherwise it get's sore, but then every time I walk in there I can see every joint   a lot better.
Mind you, you just have to learn, you can only, you've got to put the paper up that sticks haven't you?
Hm.
Got a sort of sheen on it hasn't it?
Hm.
And there not that small any more are they?
I mean, you know there not going to go round with a felt tip pen.
No.
There better not.
.
Hm.
Yeah I'll have it that way, I don't like it the other way up.
Most of the flowers are the wrong way.
Darling there is a joi a pattern.
.
Well it isn't for me.
.
.
And then you fold, you paste the bottom first, then you fold that up.
Well I thought wall paper ought to stick because wall paper was on Amy's bedroom.
Yeah.
You know, ordinary wall  that was just, just  wall paper wasn't it?
Yeah.
And eh that just stuck and the joins were alright  It just took so long before as well didn't it.
It did.
Can I have the scissors?
Thank you.
I mean I not very happy with the lounge either.
No I'm not.
Just glad we didn't do the hall.
Driven me mad that would.
Or our bedroom.
Pardon.
Or our bedroom.
Hm 
Funny though I mean I've never known problem before.
No.
It's not as if the house is terribly old or any thing that the plasters, even .
It isn't just the plaster is it,.
Yeah, it was all the new walls as well.
I mean it hasn't done it any good all the  in Amy's bedroom where  where it had to put the copydex it's all got brownish and, hasn't it? you can see where the.
.
Hm, yeah, it's not, it's not quite the same colour, you can see where the copydex has been.
Well it doesn't like vinyl paper for some reason.
No, it'll dry out .
Yeah  It wasn't that  it wasn't the lumps that bothered me it was the uhum, the fact that the edges just doesn't stay down.
Yeah.
I think I might cut another piece of paper, the side won't stay flat.
Huh, I'm quite please about that.
Annoying when your not pleased with when you spent all your time doing it and then your not pleased with it .
Yeah .
Splendid.
Yeah..
.
Yeah I thought, just thought you might want to get behind it.
Ga-  Gary's off the .
Hm, well he doesn't tell me either.
.
Well you probably lose a bit, it's not sticking properly to the wall.
Is that when you take it round and eh .
Take what round?
What, you know, round the corner, and keep it straight.
oh I see what you mean.
Another one after that rather than cutting .
where you've got some  in there it won't matter.
No.
You're alright.
Right.
Nowhere near, half I should think.
Oh dear.
Come on  at it.
So  matches this side, not to low, it's to low on the other bit,.
Is it?
Hm 
Watch your elbow on that cos you could knock it off couldn't you?.
What .
Hm 
Hm, hm.
Thank you.
Is Clare still awake?
Did you go down?
Yeah, yeah, she's a.
Right, I mean that's the time when a video is useful.
Right.
She's not really well enough to do any thing is she?
No.
It's  it's a bit boring for her just to lye there.
Got video's down here a hundred and fifty pound .
.
I don't really know how much we  we use it really.
No, no, I mean I wouldn't a video to .
I mean  I mean during the week she never, she's going to get to the stage except that Chris is taking Amy to ballet, she won't see Neighbours at all.
.
No.
Don't want to come down too hard on her.
She misses it on Monday cos she goes to flute, she misses it, she wa-  she sees it on Tuesday cos Chris takes Amy to ballet, she was, she misses it on Wednesday cos she goes skiing, she misses it on Thursday because we have to take Amy to uhum Brownies, she misses it on Friday cos of Amy's swimming.
.
No, no she doesn't want to watch, I thing honestly when she comes home from school she's tired out.
Yeah.
But, you know she just puts it on, she doesn't want to do any thing for a hour or so and just sit and recover.
I don't think you can really grumble.
Has she not  I mean she never watches it after tea if you notice, she'll always go out and play or something.
I know.
She'll watch it half an hour in the evening before she goes to bed if she gets the chance.
She doesn't watch all that, she doesn't watch all that much really  I think she gets more tired than Amy in a way.
Hm..
I think Clare lives more on her nerves.
Hm.
And that when she comes home, cos she's you know, had enough.
Are we going that way next?
Well I .
, this is when you'll need a plumb line for that won't you?
Yeah.
Is it a very good plumb, oh you've got  plumb line for the top and the bottom haven't you?and hope.
.
Ah and the next piece is going to go over the window.
Yeah.
So you need it.
Yeah.
It down to get the line at the bottom .
Yeah , yeah..
You won't .
Oh it's quite pretty.
That's about right cos you wouldn't want a big pattern in a room this size would you?
No.
.
I tell you what, eh you wouldn't get any.
twenty.
Yes  Steven's not having a particularly good week for his holidays is he?
No he isn't..
Yeah.
I wouldn't be at all impressed with it.
Oh Deborah was moaning cos she went to a party the other  last one  this week, I think at the beginning of the week, and the had Joey the clown and Mr Nuttey, she said oh I'd like them, but Sue said she went sort of a bit earlier and see how they got on and eh, she said oh it wasn't the same at five, they didn't respond and.
Yeah.
You know they were much quieter, it didn't go with a swing that Amy's.
How old is Clare, she's a bit older?
She's six.
She has it six, seven and eight.
Yeah.
Cos she said she thought, you know, they needed to be a bit older.
Yeah.
I mean she's talking about it and I said well I thought at five they were probably a bit young.
Hm.
We haven't, we didn't have it till they were six.
Deborah apparently wasn't pleased.
That's right,.
How are you then pet?
Hm.
You've got a bit of colour back now.
Hm.
Could you  could you manage another drink?
What was sue on the phone for?
She want's the uhum  eh the plates and things for the party.
When she .
A bit later on.
Said she was very sorry.
Hm.
Whole poached egg in  
Mummy, mummy look.
Mummy.
Oh poppet obviously going to .
Can I .
Yeah, she looks as though she's got a bit more colour and she says she feels a bit better.
.
Oh I think you better cut, she's watching Kipps, says quite good, Half a Sixpence, she says it's quite good.
Enjoying it.
Would you like to come and cut this bit, cos it's left handed.
Which bit?
The top.
Yeah .
Oh  That bits left handed.
I can't, I can't left handed with right handed scissors can I?
Oh no, no, you seem better at left handed than I did.
Right, is that level?
Yeah?
No, I don't mean that, I mean here.
Oh there.
I not  the top.
It's gonna brighten up now.
Yeah it is.
Well it seems to me, if you cut it, if you put that one there, then this other piece, it'll use to do in there.
What other piece?
Well, if we cut a piece round there.
Yeah.
And the other piece that we got could do that one, that piece in there.
Ah, you not, yes, alright.
Ok  .
Well I mean half a bottle to do the top and the down, you can do that bit, measure if you like.
Yeah, ok, if you can measure it, then I can cut off...
Can't tell whether that's going to reach or not.
I don't think it is, I think, no, I think you've got to come down another pattern.
Oh that one down then .
Got what you want?
Yeah.
.
Couldn't really see in the corner whether it was going, so tight.
Shall I go and get the other scissors out of the  cut the right side.
Yes.
Okay.
Right, now you've got a bit to match it with.
Yeah, that looks.
Well that bit was wrong.
What bit was wrong?
That bit.
Why was it wrong?
Well it's the wrong pattern, up side down for a start, with the other piece of 
Right, so I have to .
Hm  Well your on that side and it's half an inch too short isn't it?
Let's have a go with a  this roll down here then.
Haven't much choice have you?
No I haven't.
Where I'm going to sleep?
Your going to sleep  wall paper.
No I'm not 
.
sort of sort of just North of that Blue one.
Sort of across there and then.
Across there.
Hm.
. I know it's not the easiest thing to measure is it?
Hello 
Hello how what do you think?
It's nice.
It goes on a lot better than Amy's.
Does it?
Yeah.
Do you like their suit.
What?
Do you like their shell suit?
Like whose?
Deborah's and Catherine's?
Am I sleeping in here?
Yeah.
Or not up there?
Yeah, I mean wallpaper, you don't have to stay away from it.
Didn't you, I mean, it's not like paint.
There what d'you think?
Gone up quite well.
Pardon?
It's gone up quite well.
Yeah.
You can see the joins though .
Well you won't so much when it's dried.
Hm.
You can't see them very well..
You've still got the tape recorder on.
I know  Oh I've got to get these tapes used up.
All of them?
Oh no, I don't think I should use all of them, about half of them I should think.
Ten, how many you on?
Seven I think.
Eight,eight.
Does it?
Oh well, I'm on eight, I've done seven.
I've only got to do it to the end of today so, I don't think I'm going to use twenty do you?
No.
Oh, fed up with this aren't you?
Hm  What's  doing in my .
He's written Clare's room, wallpapered on the first of June, that's a bit optimistic, by Helen and Alistair.
I  done that writing.
Probably.
What daddy's like.
Anyway makes it look a little smarter doesn't it, than with a green carpet, it'll look nice, yes.
I can't choose another carpet can I?
No.
It looks better all the same colour instead of some walls green, some walls white.
Yeah.
So I assume Half a Sixpence is finished.
Was it good?
Yeah.
Quite a nice film.
It's a weird story.
I had to do that for O'level.
What?
That story.
Writing?
No I had to study the book.
Why?
Well for English literature they set you so many books to study, that was one of them.
a stupid book .
questions .
Yes, from all the characters and
Pardon.
From all the characters and how they fitted into the story.
Did you pass?
Only just .
I don't like that book at all, it was a book.
What other books are there?
You have a Shakespeare play, you had Silas Marner I think I quite liked that one.
I had one of J-  uhum, oh I can't remember his name, another play.
George Bernard Shaw.
Hm,.
Thought that was fairly silly as well.
That was four, I think that was probably all I had, two books, two plays, it's quite enough.
What're you having for dinner?
Chicken casserole, and you can have a little bit.
.
Well you look better than you did, you've got some colour in your face now.
I'll have a tiny bit.
You can have a little bit of something to eat 
Hopefully I'll be better tomorrow.
I hope so poppet.
Hope to get you back to school on Monday, it seems awful if you've had a week off and then your not well.
Yeah.
This was all a bit sudden, I though you were better.
Hm  Have you finished yet?
Well I need daddy to a  start along there .
Why can't you?
Well the light has got to come off and you've got to drop a perpendicular so that you know, cut the paper straight, it helps if you put it up straight instead of wonky.
Pardon?
What did she say?
Why, she want's the crates and the things for the party.
.
Well she, I told her you weren't very well, she was very sorry  Didn't say a lot else.
.
Well not really, yet at the moment.
We might need it yet to do another bit.
You got enough roll's?
I don't know yet.
I shall tell when we get to the end..
Want to come down stairs?
I'm all dirty, I was really waiting for daddy to come back up.
.
.
If I go down that'll be even more ages won't it?
Why?
Hm cos I shall have to talk as well 
There's nothing on T V.
Isn't there?
Don't think so .
No.
What do you think?
Can't decide whether I like those shell suits or not really.
What?
I can't decide whether I like those shell suits or not, you know, sort of thing.
Colour you mean.
No, I meant in general.
.
I think.
I don't like the .
Hm.
.
I think a lot of them have, has Amy's got a hood?
No.
Hasn't it?
.
Hm.
The uhum, C & A's has a lot of them, went down there looking for some shoes for Amy.
Did you get .
No, she wanted some flip flops, but they didn't have any there either, but they had a lot of shell suits, cos I thought it was skiing ones at first.
Hm.
I thought they were skiing one's at first, and then I .
.
There suppose to be quite warm I think.
I think there wind proof aren't they?
The chain,.
No, don't worry.
Pardon.
I wouldn't worry, I think they can sort it out.
I don't think it's gonna last her long cos she pulls at it.
Does she?
Why?
Cos she doesn't leave any thing like that alone, does she?
.
Well she pulls, fiddles with any thing, doesn't she?
She got  tee shirt.
Catherine?
Oh yeah, did before Amy.
Amy Johnson's got a brace now, she doesn't speak very well with it.
Doesn't she,why?
I don't know, just a band, you know round, like you had in.
Oh.
But she lisps, it's in her way she's got , doesn't talk very clearly.
.
Well, she didn't have it last time I saw her, she's got it now.
So I suppose she got it some time this week.
.
No.
What's the result guv?
He says money's a bit scarce at the moment.
What .
.
Oh, well, there've just had a whole new di-  bedroom suite.
yes.
Oh, I presume his getting paid  Going to lap that over?
That why he did his own decorating.
.
Your not getting as much of this new job.
That means the car goes back on.
No, I think he  he says  taking over the car lease.
Oh.
.
.
.
Buy a new one.
No matching up to do here.
No not really.
Is that alright?
It's not far out is it?
What  that lot out I think.
. Alright.
There's too many fingers in the way isn't there?
Well if we put a cut in here that might .
.
Oh no, I want these,.
Just cut it .
Where's this off -here?
Hm.
. Yes .
.
Yes, but I can't make the.
You can't just pull that across, might look a long way out .
It's wrong, as from there, that's where it starts to go wrong.
Here.
Hm  .
It's not easy is it?
. I suppose what we should of done is, done the next one along the drop down there and then matched it all up backwards isn't it?
Hm.
No, we do the next one.
I don't think it'll be a bad idea, I don't think I can match this one off, do you?
Well it's never going to go straight and it's going to put the whole lot out isn't it?
What was that?
He was saying he doesn't do any  so his into the eh .
Well he doesn't even take it.
No.
.
Very high yesterday.
Ah yes, yeah his got two point three litres .
Yeah, I bet he hasn't sort of tried to talk has he?.
Right.
, if you hang that one and then will put this one up too it.
That one worked fine.
Oh, good.
Right.
I think it'll probably got the other one.
Do what?
I think I've got another one.
The other one, completing the other..
Yeah.
Right.
.
Right, so if I cut the top of this.
So I think we put the, take the other one off and paper it.
.
It doesn't at that section.
Haven't got any underlay for her .
There's gonna be wastage there isn't there?
Hm.
Unless there join a .
Oh I think not.
Got to join it across the .
I suppose .
can't turn it around .
Uhum.
the door way I think.
Width of the door.
And I don't , can see where your going to have a strip the width of the room and add on the width of the door on the end.
So they cut it off and re-join it.
Cut it off where?.
Front.
.
Yes, I mean you've no choice you got to .
Oh .
Just how many joins you'd have otherwise.
Well,.
About .
You haven't lost a .
How long is it sixty feet?
Seventy isn't it?
Yeah.
.
.
I mean  oh use to run it length ways and then the width is fixed isn't it?
Have a lot of waste.
Hm.
How wide is it?
Well it's not ten foot wide is it?
the uhum seven foot wide, I should think, it's never six foot six.
So if the carpet was four foot wide you could.
.
.
I talked to John earlier.
Did he say what he'd been doing with himself?
Well .
.
I can't remember what that .
Well, yes, it's, it's quite narrow isn't it at the back.
Just about get a, about three or four  one.
Yeah.
There a replaced .
Hm.
Mind you there whole garden looks a bit.
Hm.
Bit difficult you know.
No doesn't pay for the  does it?.
Hm..
Well there've got Michael .
.
It's  tree.
It's all along the back isn't it?
.
Trouble is if we don't lay a patio he .
Unless he lays it behind the garage.
.
Hm..
What're you doing now?
If it doesn't rain I'll get a bit in the garden .
.
If it doesn't rain I'll get a bit done in the garden tomorrow.
Get some plants .
Yeah.
Is she, she sounds .
Well they took her at the  there was a  I was gonna give one .
Got one with a bigger bit gave .
She hasn't had any thing think to eat since she had that biscuit.
.
Oh, it's quite hard work isn't it?
I.
The trouble is you know she's get  and have a good go at it, it's not worth it with all the .
. Cheese cake had .
.
No I don't think she does, I, no need for putting it off.
No.
She's dying to go out and play with her tennis racket.
She isn't very well.
No.
Oh, I just hope she does get better next week.
. The weather is so dreadful isn't it?
.
Yes.
Sue said it rained on Gregory's birthday last year.
Did it?.
Did you say that?dead lucky, never of done  last three years it's rained.
Oh it was quite useful to find Half a Sixpence .
No.
she's not really a, sick for long.
Give her any thing else?
No she's .
I thought for ten pence a week that was not bad rubbish.
Wouldn't say a lot for it, but I don't think ten pence out of the way  any way.
Hm.
