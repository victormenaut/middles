Come and have a cup of coffee and Tony can pick you up and all.
Geoff dropped the radio in the bath and put a hole in it?

We need a new bathroom suite.
So now you can't have a bath?

Well I can have one every sort of, but I just get into the bath just after the water is slipping out.
And he's pulling the sink 
Oh no!

I worked in my room.
I wanted to go, go to the library but I thought I'd start in my room so 
 
You know if I came in to see Kim, your room, we'd never get anything done.
Yeah that's it.
And then once Helen and that had woken up that was  about half eleven she woke up and then it like, oh,our provisions and then we started talking and everything else together like 
Do you work from half eight till half eleven?
Well, she .
I didn't, I work, I started at half nine and I finished at half ten and I went to  you know.

Then I had to get ready to go to the bank.
To get the  
So is Tony gonna be staying awake until the time that you finish there?
Well I was saying to Alison, the only thing I can do is when I phone him 
 
he's gonna come.
Go this morning and then come straight here.
Oh!
More than likely.
I know.
I know.
Maybe she'll stay at work and come and pick me up.
So either way one of you's gonna be hanging around.
I mean, either you've gotta hang around in the morning, or he's gotta hang around at night.
Don't know.
Is, is he leaving before then or what?
Or you gonna take the car or  get the bus?
No I'll take the car.
I could never get the bus here.
Your telling me!
Well I know, I mean  you  
This is typical!
I know.
I know, isn't it?
Such a waste of time isn't it?
I mean what have we done, we ended up coming all this way .
I've got a headache already!
Mm. 
Oh yes!
It was brilliant!
It was buzzing!
Yes, but it was the day 
Oh yeah.
that I had my perm, and you know how it's dead 
It was sticking up here  .
and I thought it was just tickling  tickly you know  and erm  it wasn't until I,su I went and sat back in my seat I was watching 
And been

You know, I was watching them do other people's  and my Aunty Gwendoline was with me and she said it's  said that it's .
Oh!

So what did they 
if those 
heal you ?
Well they just said that all your stresses would go away which was 
Did they?
the, no.
Oh!.
I mean, I was like, you know, I was still worried.
I was still worried.
Still stressed.
But erm  I felt as though, I felt exactly the same, I felt  I'd just been asleep  I just had my eyes shut and I felt opening one eye to have a look out and see what people were doing.
 
That's like that is it?
So then 
People were looking at you.
and then I was away  and he wasn't there any more  and I thought, what do I do now?
So
I opened my eyes  and he come rushing over and he said, are you alright?
Would you like a glass of water?
And I said, no I'm fi you sure?
I'll you get you  no.
Fine.
Fine.
And then he said well take a seat when you're ready.
Started giving me a .
So I thought, right you are .
I thought, oops!
Erm  
Really?
Yeah.
Were you
Well
immobilized?
well   I won't get it now .
Erm, not really.
  
 
Doesn't she?
Come on then.
Crikey!
And then
Oh that's  good that like.
and whe when I went to get up  I was fine.
I thought I would, I thought I would fall but I   I just walked back to my chair and I was fine.
And my aunty Gwendoline said is  were you asleep?
I said, no!
I mean I really just  sitting 
Oh.
like this  I wasn't the least bit  even    not tired or anything.
She says   she says it looked like you were out of it!
She said, he looked dead worried when he walked away from you, he kept looking at you.
Yeah.
You know.
Yeah, you were
Looked like you were gonna fall off your chair.
Yeah..
Ooh!
Ooh!
Ooh!
He's 
Er 
behind you!
So I said, you know I didn't want to know.
But I wanted to know, people  dead weird and anyway it turned out, do you believe in ?
I think so, yeah.
Cos I'm sick of telling people that don't believe in it and I feel a complete 
Right.
turd!
So
Okay.
So what happened?
But erm  it turns out that's what they were.
I really  a word, and they had a little chat to us.
Mm.
Well
About what?
People
About the people  who are dead?
Oh!
Oh!
About
They weren't trying to get you to 
and, about the  you know,th yeah 
Yeah.
Well I 
because I'm the one who was da doing that because tha I mean I was .
But, he was horri the guy that was doing me didn't know  he had a pair of a like  off er  yeah.
He was built a bit like Jack.
And he had a white T-shirt, pair of jeans, a beer belly and tattoos up his arms.
And he was the one 
Who's the kind of person with  !
Exactly!
We went into this room and there was this music playing like on the erm  like John  
Indian music.
would play on the 
Oh no.
on erm 
Like in fantasy
Yeah.
John's sort of thing.
You know water   a blue light bulb in the middle of the room
and I'm thinking, Oh!
 
Come on!
What are letting yourself in for?
You know.
But it was just  I mean, the things that they said  honestly  weird.
They're good aren't they?
Did I tell you once that a nurse on  erm  radiotherapy  did my psychometry?
Yeah.
Did I tell you?
Yeah.
I remember you said.
Well this, did I, didn't I tell you?
Yeah.
Oh sh I've definitely heard this one.
What was that?
She was holding my fob watch and she said a few things about this, and about us and about dead people and 
She was closer to you and things like 
Yeah.
that.
Yeah.
Well this guy, he went  
Yeah.
Oh!
the same person was there with exactly the same message.
Cos she said  what happened was he said 
Was she  fed up?
Dunno.
He'd already got the message 
 
and met someone 
 
else !
It's a him.
It's a him.
They'll not let, let somebody else have a turn ?
Well it was, what happened right, I'll tell you the whole story from the very beginning.
But basically, the man that, you know, my father said to me  well he said to   where's the horses?
He says I'm getting horses all the time.
And of course my Aunty Annie, Gwenny went
and he says is it you?
I said, well
could be.
Well, you know 
He said just everything that was happening, I kept getting horses.
And anyway, he said to me he says is there a man  in the spirit world close to you?
No!
So I just thought of my granddad.
And I said, yeah, but  I was very sort of non-committal 
Non-committal.
Yeah.
and very, well  I suppose
Yeah.
kind of 
Could be.
attitude.
Could be.
Erm, cos I just thought he was guessing, you know, and he said  he says, I didn't see him, he said I only saw him and pointed to this girl over the other side of the room he was standing beside you when you were in the chair.
Oh no!
He says I'll get her to come over and have a chat with you.
And she came over after 
Did she describe him?
Aha.
So who was it?
My dad's granddad.
His name 
Oh no!
and everything.
His physique, his erm  his physical appearance, his character  and why he was there and it's exactly what that Merv said off radiotherapy.
Mm mm.
 
Why was he there?
There's something I've got to do.
I need a bit of a push to do it.
But there's something that you want to achieve, there's something you've got to do 
Got to make a jumper.
get on and do it.
 
Qualify this.
That is exactly what it's not.
Yeah.
It's your riding.
Well that's what everybody says.
Yeah.
Or it's having a baby.
Well I don't think it is.
 
It's probably getting married.
It's getting married, yes .
I don't think it is.
Well what's your main 
I thi 
main ambition in life?
I think it's to do my riding exams  but, I ca as I said, cos Brenda whose horse I ride up at Bridley  I was telling her and I said, why would the spirit world get in such a state
About riding exam.
about me doing riding exams?
He said  he said which wo what would happen if you got your riding exam
when you qualify nursing?
I said well I'll probably choose 
Yeah.
riding.
I wouldn't know.
He said well really  for some reason you ought not to be a nurse.
I mean, you know how th if you believe in fate and is, is there any control over it or
Yeah.
is it all planned out for you and 
Mm.
and this kind of thing, is, is someone trying to steer your  care or your, the rest 
Away from 
of your life?
away from something.
Which it would be.
Away from something.
So I don't know, I mean, I'm very open-minded, I mean 
Oh yeah.
but erm  he described a, my mum  told her everything  about  a fall  the bump on her head, he knew
Oh.
just loads of things.
Very strange.
I found that research book.
 

Doesn't Jane look yellow?
What?
D'ya think Jane looks a bit yellow?
I've probably got reflection off her .
I know.
See if any of us look,ta talking about yellow.
Mm.
Mm.
So?
So it was very good.
I dunno if I would go to one now.
Well I, I want to go  now, to er, erm  and just try one of the other ones.
Tonight I'm gonna go the open circle.
I wish I could go.
I, I would go, but I'd be frightened 
 
to stay there.
Well I am whe 
So am I.
see what happened is, I  came over and he says, you know I've told  this lady that you saw the man standing beside her and she went  she sort of, she described him, apparently he was very tall  which
Yeah.
we knew wasn't my granddad cos my granddad was knee high to a grasshopper, erm  straight as a dye in character and  physical appearance, er like he had a rod up his back which was one of these expressions,
Oh!
I see.
which apparently he was.
Obviously I've never met him.
I don't think my dad even met him.
Yeah.
And then she said erm  she said, and I suppose  she turned to the other guy, she said, we're not supposed to do clairvoyants, like, laughing, you know.
And he says, ah, go on it's the end.
Cos the all the  was over.
And then he actually went into a
A trance?
well not a trance, it was just so normal.
She tho she was doing this right as she spoke
Like Whoopi Goldberg in Ghost?
No!
Oh.
Dead normal!
She, she was going like, you're me and I'm her
Ha.
and she was standing, I was sitting like, she was standing, she sort of went  can you take a Lesley?
I went  yeah.
She says, not in the spirit world.
Can you take a what?
Lesley.
And I said well, yeah and I've got a cousin Lesley .
And then nothing more was said about that.
And then she was going  there's something you need to do.
She was literally having a two-way conversation, although, not in an odd way, not going  ooh!
Ooh!
Ooh!
You know?
She was just like talking to herself, she's going
Yeah.
and then she would turn her attention back to me.
Mm.
Oh!
How strange!
And described him and 
She thinks  she 
his name.
might be going on Wednesday.
And Lyndsey might be able to tell you something.
Well 
I know.
Well that's what I'm thinking.
I'll go, my sister's going with us  and I'll, the following Wednesday I'll tell you what it's like.
Right.
Right.
Okay.
Come with us.
Then we'll go and see the district nurse on Wednesday, is there anything you want me to say?
But it's not real 
But I don't, what if I don't know things?
Then I might spend the rest 
I know.
of my thinking 
I know.
It's just that you won't 
that hasn't happened yet.
Well, if you're that sort of person, I would worry about them you see.
Now 
Yeah.
someone said to me, I know not, not like an accident or death or anything, but someone said erm  you don't have any sisters or something?
I would imagine, in my mind, that something's gonna happen to my sisters for her not to be able to see it.
I was just thi I remember when I was young 
I thought 
my mum went to a fortune teller and, and I had  there like tears running  Oh!
Oh .
And she told us we were gonna move to a house with a green door .
And did you?
My mum bottled out when we got there.
Well 
Bet your  there must be a .
the thing, the thing that erm worries me is in case I go over is, that you say
You're not gonna have any children.
you're gonna have  two marriages.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
That's right, you know.
Because someone told Tony's mum that Tony would be married twice and the second marriage would be very happy.
But then you'd taken that to be that first woman, that Gill person, Gill 
Yeah 
Yeah.
somebody.
Yeah.
But that's it.
You will really 
But if they say to me, I'll be marri I'm just gonna be thinking oh my God!
But you will relate it, cos  no matter what they say you will relate it.
Yeah.
 

will be along after this.
Keep the noise down thank you.
not here.
Right.
Moving swiftly along  er, the little thing on the timetable you know  for the  the last session where it says quiz  it's not really a quiz.
It was at the end of the  the module.
But what we  are gonna do is, is give out  your study guides and the areas that we'll be revising.
We'll do it now.
While you're   
I don't think I'm even gonna bother revising for this.
I'm not.
Will it be a multiple choice or a  written or a 
 
Oh yeah.
And do I have to ?
I think, I think so.
A mixture I suppose.
Well I can't be 
A mixture.
bothered.
Is it serious?
Is it like a
Serious ?
Well it's for yo for your benefit.
It's no one 's but  .
must have all this studying won't they?
 

Don't worry about it.
What do you use to chew in
Ooh!
This looks a little bit less
?
doesn't it?
What colour is an orange ?
What do what is this last thing you have er according to you?
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
What?
Not like who was that man's enemies and things like that.
Like the last one.
Name the se dwarfs or what they're called?
Yeah.
Name the seven dwarfs.
And certain parts are  
The false  formastation and things.
No!
That was  stupid that!
And I got it wrong.
 
 
You got it wrong?
What was that?
Blooming stupid question!
It was the way it was phrased.
Oh, so expulsion of
of sperm.
And it was, it was something.
And it was ejaculation 
But I thought it was masturbation.
Well I thought it was the forced
Yeah.
Well, it's funny, I was telling Stephen, my boyfriend, about that, and I was telling him the question and he said 
Yeah.
that.
Oh.
Well Geoff laughed at me when I told him.
He said, er bloody typical!
Yeah but don't  he said .
We want a break now.
The stupid old bag hasn't looked at it!
I've got a headache.
That's June .
Determined to sort  
but she's gone now.
No, it's not.
That's June .
She is, cos I lent her th you know.
I know.
That's what I was thinking.
 

Well they're not the same  are they?
No.
 

I had to take Tony to the casualty on Saturday?
Why?
Got a crack on the side of his head at rugby.
And he, he, er  and his hearing went.
Ah!
Ah!
And he was feeling a bit  back taken.
Mm.
Is he alright?
He's got i he's got a card with  I have had a recent head injury.
Signs to look for.
Ah!
Oh!
Please report immediately.
Who?
Tony.
Tony.
Has he?
What happened to him?
He got a knock on 
 
on Saturday.
But I think it was when he was tackling and erm 
?
got a cra no he didn't black out.
And he says, but he got like a crack on the side of his head  and his hear 
Oh!
On his head?
and his hearing went
Any questions about that guide?
so I had to take him
Was it bad that ?
Was it the R V I or the General?
No.
Was it bad?
I'll sho oh I'll show
?
Yes.
well he's er, he says he's done a big X-ray.
Mm.
This is your study guide.
Work your way through the guide and you're going to answer all the questions on the quiz.
As usual, the papers are taken and they're kept  in the file for yo reference by your personal tutors.
The reason that we're gonna produce biological science quizzes is they're, it's from your feedback evaluations that you don't get enough  biological science.
Soon put right.
Not a lot more I can say to you is there?
Oh I know.
Yeah.
I never said that.
believe it or not.
There's  about sixty percent 
I might have said that.
of the people who are at the end of a  said  they didn't get enough.
We haven't had enough biological science.
So that'll teach us to .
didn't want the sixty percent.
the little areas as well though.
You do need to have a basic knowledge of 
Yeah.
biological science to understand  
Unfortunately you didn't have to do the .
Providing you have .
Would you agree?
Yeah.
Anybody dares 
Yeah.
to disagree?
No.
Right.
Very sensible.
Cos Jane doesn't wanna be on the .
Now the nasty erm  half past seven session sorted out.
What can, what can we do for another three hours ?
I re I think we'll go and  I'll think you just go for tea  and come back in
Yeah !
Four and a half 
an hour.
we've got.
Good God!
 
You can have ti be back at half past three.
Okay?
Is this like coffee time?
Or is this like 
This is a coffee break.
You know,.
So  I need to know what time we'll be finished.
We would've been revising had we not been here.
Exactly!
Oh!
I'm going to watch the end of Neighbours anyway.
Yeah.
I would have seen erm  I'm not gonna see it.
What am I gonna do!
It's very important you know!
For my wellbeing isn't it?
Set the video.
For my wellbeing .
Anyway, she's lost the battle
Wouldn't that do it?
Watch what episode you put on.
I know.
Do we have any idea what time we'll be finished?
Cos I've gotta phone my ?
When Carole finishes  when Carole finishes in this session I'm gonna go and have a chat with her.
Because what we'll have to do is negotiate at the end of the next session, whenever we've finished, cos that's entirely dependent on  when we get fed up varies on what  
When we run out  
say, I mean, you know, what your response to the session is.
But usually it finishes within an hour and a half  the next session.
Which might 
Right.
well finish at  five o'clock.
Right.
Five o'clock.
Right.
And then i then it's time for a break again.
Now
I think we've gotta be careful, if we cut out the breaks, you see 
Aha.
an awful lot of people saying let's work right through  you're not affective, you're not learning 
No.
if you 
No.
haven't gone away 
No.
and had 
No.
a break.
And I mean, there's, you know, the people who smoke need a boost of nicotine they'll go and get 
Yeah.
one.
Like if you wanna get a Coke 
People who drink Coke need a
Yeah .
Well we, we'll be off as much as anyone else, but you've gotta
Aha.
you se 
Yeah.
well I'm gonna be off more than anybody else.
when I spoke to Carole and she wasn't happy about it.
Caro well Carole  is problem, I don't think I've  personally
Should be bothered with it, yeah.
 
but she's got the biggest problem of all because she's gotta pick us
Yeah.
the girls up, get them back home and come back.
No, she's bringing them 
 
in here though isn't 
So 
she?
if, today she can come in early 
Right.
Okay.

Cos she's got the last session hasn't she?
That's right.
Yeah.
Ori originally she didn't.
Aha.
Cos originally I had the last session but we  cancelled .
 
 
Well,, I'm sure you can read that first, I've got my own to talk about.

Ooh!
Tony snores all the time.
Richard ever snore though?
No.
Never snores.
All the time!
Constantly.
The only time Richard snores, snores is if he's got a cold and he can't breathe  through his nose.
Tony snores any time.
I do.
Whether he's on his back, on his side, on his stomach.
How do you know like .
Richard doesn't even move 
Wanna bet?
in bed.
Oh bliss!
Never moves.
That must be bliss.
You don't even know he's there.
Never moves.
Whereas I  wriggle around and I'm kicking people, and I'm elbowing people!
I don't remember staying with you like.

Yes.
It's five past.
Alright then.

Alright?

Aye.
Oh I see.
Right.
Shovel them in there!
Come on then.
I will 
See you later.
See you later.
Bye!
Bye.
Bye.
Enjoy your research.
Who's she?
Pauline .
Why did I think her name was Susie?
I think that's really odd  that someone  won't live at someone's  after they've lived with them.
D'ya know what I mean?
What she hasn't live with him?
Well, she's stayed with him for like weekends, or weeks.
Mm mm.
She's doing everything that she's going to.
I know, but it's a I think it's the family.
Mm.
I didn't realize her family didn't know mind.
You'd think the brother and sister would.
Well, I think they do, but they just pretend.
Mm mm.
The family likes to pretend that they do.
Because it's, it's easier, they don't like to  to realize these things.
I think it's very romantic.
The whole thing .
Oh I don't think she's saying that.
Yeah I know.
But you know about, typical woman.
families have sex before marriage.
Well a how many people though Alison?
Not very many.
Someone in my hairdressers  were talking about it.
Sam's cousin, Debbie  went out with him for  over six years.
Well what if you don't like it when you get married?
Exactly!
.
Yeah.
That's right.
Your wedding night must be such a let down.
And that's on your first night!
Would be awful!
Woo!
Ooh!
Ooh!
Ooh!
Ooh!
Painful.
Ooh!
Hoo!
Hoo!
Ooh hoo!
It's sore!
I know.
Real,Real sound effects !
Is that on?
It's not the same kind of thing though.
Well
Be like, ooh!
Ooh!
Ooh!
Ooh!
Mm.
Anyway.
But imagine that on your wedding night?
Mm.
At least your honeymoon can 
This  makes me feel all dead romantic and sexy !
I know.
It'll be like
It'll be like, don't come near me again!
Yeah.
Twin beds  please.
Oh God!
So is she quite brainy then?
She is isn't she?
Yes.
She gets really high scores in her exams doesn't she?
The kind of thing Denise likes to know about people.
I dunno.
Well I have to know these things.
I know you do dear.
I say I'm sure, did she not get the eighty percent in the open book exam?
She's got lovely hair!
Mm!
Got something about her personal appearance as well!
She's got nice hair Jan.
I think she's got nice hair.
Yeah but she does well in her exams so
Don't you think these things are important?
What that you've got lovely hair?
No, that you do well in your exams.
No, that you do well  in your exams .
Denise isn't interested in her hair really.
No.
She was only saying it as a balance.
No.
I was gonna ask her where she gets her hair done actually.
Well that's right.
She's got a bit of money there.
She lives down there. 
By herself?
Those  with the bay windows?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Tt.
Along that row, she's, her dad 
They're very nice.
her mum died of cancer.
She lives with 
Ah!
Ah!
her dad.
Mm.
How old is she?
And she got a younger sister.
Twenty.
Oh!
Oh!there.
I says to her, you bloody well do that then!
Can you take the ?
Four hour .
Beg your pardon?
Er, shut up!
Don't forget you said this is still .
 
I didn't say that.
Yes you are.
They will tell you.
What?
And then we won't know when we go.
I'm getting a bit spooked about this exam now.
I am.
I keep suddenly thinking of the enormity of it.
And th the fact that I haven't really revised.
At least you, you are in the same  place.
I keep thi I keep sitting down to it and thinking  God!
There's so much I haven't done for this exam.
As usual, I should have started ages ago.
But I found when I looked at my books a week ago, or a fortnight ago, I thought, oh I know this, I know this, but it's not until you get into it  that you think  shit!
I don't know this and I could be learning.
A week ago I didn't know what to learn and now there's so many things that I know I want to learn.
Mm mm.
Well every time, every time we come in and she mentions, have you done this, that 
Yeah.
and I think 
Can I have one of them things?
I know.
You.
You.
What?
Fizzy gum balls.
Oh.
She always does.
Get one of them
 
I'll get one 
It's only funny when  
Pardon you!
Thi a I have to say that  she does it all the time and she goes, looks around.
Does it  .
A girl I used to work with at the Beechams did like really big  burps.
I'd say she ate about anything and like  pardon me.
She would .
My grandma's like that.
Horrible!
I mean she wo she says pardon me or excuse me, but it's so matter of fact that I'd be  I could never burp like that if I tried, you know.
She did a big, I went in the kitchen at  at work on Friday and Saturday
What time, what time have we gotta, do we have to be back?
Twenty past.
And the, the chef's were squeezing the custard  carton and it was going  cos it was the last and the 
Custard?
You mean they don't make their own custard?
Nah!
They don't make anything man.
Tt!
And they were squeezing it out of the carton and it was making this right farty noise.
I'm not kidding, the three of them,thir thirty odd year old one of them is, they were on the 
Well I've been 
floor laughing!
 
One was going, the other ha ha ha!
The custard's going
My dad's forty 
And I'm thinking 
three and he still 
How old?
does things 
Do you not
like that though.
do you not laugh when a squeezy bottle does it?
No.
Oh!
I think it's so funny !
I mean, it's funny like when you burp because you get, embarrass you like.
Oh no, it makes me laugh.
And there's loads of people round about me and I just went wurgh!
And I'd like to be fined .
I hate people that erm  when my dad burps, if, if it was a cup he'd go  excuse me, but  but it's when they go   I hate that!
 

I do.
Cos I don't.
I'll conceal a burp, no matter where I am.
Well you don't   obviously !
Well that er popping out.
someone really.
You could tell 
I didn't know it was coming.
You can tell it was  
 
but make Geoff makes him burp.
Oh no!
I don't.
Cos he feels he's got a wind so he
Oh I can't force myself.
Nor can I.
Aargh.
What was that?
Oh.
When's Tony coming for you  tonight?
I said half past seven.
If we finish before then I shall be very annoyed!
They said eight o'clock, quarter to.
Quarter to eight cos they started at quarter to six.
I could just sleep.
Just feel like I'm not learning anything .
I know.
But then the thing is,
Exactly.
so I'm not learning anything and then we're to .
What have I done all day?
I know what .
in the past two days.
It's like what I said to Tony last night when I got in  I said, I feel  I could have achieved more if I'd stayed at home and revised.
Yeah!
I could of.
He said but,yo you wouldn't of.
I said well I would of that's the whole point.
I would have revised all afternoon.
I know.
Anne was saying when 
Anne 
she was revising
I've never seen 
No that was right.
The whole .
.
Sorry I didn't offer anybody cos 
No that's alright.
Oh.
And I, when she's revising she says oh I've just done about change and  theories of change.
Who?
Theories of change.
But we started with Fred and only got
Have you remembered that?
a third of a ye way through it.
Change in the N H S.
Change, do you know what change she's talking about?
Freezing, something when er a liquid is freezing and it changes when it is  you know changes in the physical sense of the 
Yeah.
word.
That's what they learn about.
I said oh that's what I've got then.
Cos I'm talking about change in the N H S is all we can put down.
Here's Anne.
But then it's just how bad it.
Oh!
I wish we'd just done that .
It's so, simplified.
So basic, so  logic.
I mean, what do we need about planning something?
We don't need it.
I mean, I didn't understand much to be honest anyway.
I wasn't listening cos I was writing them down.
The thing is, with this  I don't think half the people listen to  you're meant to know  you're meant to, in these exams you're meant to have everything you should know and everything else  
That's it.
I'm sitting writing notes and I'm thinking  am I ever gonna look at these again?
Cos every time I have an exam it's a  exactly the same things.
I have got revision cards coming out of my ears!
And erm  which I'll never look at again  at all.
We're all looking very sorry for ourselves.
Well what relevance is it to me?
Is not 
I know.
I'm not gonna be a nurse anyway.
And I'm gonna go away next, next weekend aren't I?
Tony said I need to do some exercise late at night.
Cos I annoy him.
Because as soon as I go upstairs  I'm wide awake.
Mm mm.
He says you should go, go jogging or something late at night.
I said well if you got us a dog I'd have to take it for a late night walk wouldn't I?
Come jogging with me.
Do you fancy coming jogging?
What?
Last thing at night?
Yeah.
You go first thing in the morning.
I know but I can go at night as well.
No, what, do you play squash?
What like eleven o'clock?
I don't, I've never played it but I'd certainly like to but  
I wanna play again.
I play
Mm.
He says it's very unusual, you never see me like this  .
Ooh!
I quite fancy doing that.
We should have done.
You know I was thinking today 
 
I was thinking today  erm  there's a horse
Sorry.
Say that again.
there's a horse erm  in some of the fields just coming out of Morpeth  towards Newcastle  and I saw, pardon me  as I was on the bus like yesterday coming into Morpeth and this horse just shot out of nowhere and it was  really enjoying itself!
It was like galloping along !
as if it was racing.
Yeah.
Yeah!
It was just like this !
And then it  thing and it came, it was really galloping towards the fence and then, cor!
Right up 
Yeah.
to the fence.
It stuck a  
 
All of a sudden.
And I was looking, I was thinking, oh!
To be free like that.
Mm.
And then today when I was passing it was just munching away in the corner, you know.
And I was thinking, tt, it must nice, Alison's got a hobby she can just go out and  you know, do it to get away 
Shall I tell you what it is, sometimes 
from everything.
I go back from , I'm driving over to Brenda's and I'm thinking,, and I really am, I'm driving along, you know like wha when you're in the car by yourself and everything's turning over in your head 
Mm.
and go and I tack up the horse and I get on the horse and everything  and I don't mean to say 
Falls away.
I'm drifting through the countryside cos 
No.
it might be  and I'll go over the level crossing I'll think, ooh that was a bit 
you know, things like that and then we'll see another horse in the field and Canter goes, ooh ooh
it's all so  everything
Mm.
it's, it's, it's on a different level, it really is.
And because you could, you could just like ride away and not come back ever.
Even when you come back
you feel much better.
You feel, oh I really enjoyed that.
And it's a different kind of enjoyment, but, I mean I've never played squash 
Do you feel like that when you run?
Well, well  it must be the same.
Or like when I, if I we say maybe, now I can't imagine feeling like that except with horse riding, but I suppose you do, whatever your thing is.
That's it.
It is.
Er I wish I had a hobby or a outside interest.
It has to be outside I think.
Definitely.
Yeah.
Outside  outside.
That's it.
I suppose 
Suppose like the riding.
everyone feels like that.
I think I would, I think I feel like that everything will still be there while I was riding along.
Oh!
I have to stop and think  about it, but I 
You know what your natural endorphin would come to the surface and you just start getting the feeling of well-being.
Well that's the thing like, it's
You come to solutions and conclusions and  everything's right with the world.
And we'd better go back now.
If you twitched a horses lip or ear that happens, I would really like to see if I twitched your ear.
And can we get a  
Well
Yeah.
Mm.
It brings their endorphin to the .
Did you see The World According to Garth?
No.
On Sunday.
Well I saw a little bit of it, if I wo I keep wanting to see this film
Mm.
and I've never actually seen it.
If you know what I mean?
And erm  oh just put them on that table over there.
No I don't wanna get back there, I don't wanna go back up to the wards so I'll go that way or that way?
That way.
That way?
Thanks.
Yeah.
I've forgotten which way I come in.
It's easily done.
Bye.
And erm  he's, he's got these papers like with short stories
Mm.
and the wind blows them away out of his hand, so erm
Shit!
Oh shit!
you're meant to get them in the bin not out of the bin.
 
And th he's picking them all up and this one  there's a  like a rockwe erm, doberman pinscher standing and these papers  between his legs .
urgh!
Urgh!
Like this, and he's saying, Bonkers, now give me that paper!
Give me that paper!
The dog just leaps on him right,so he's wrestling this dog, and he's screaming and the dog going, growling at him and everything 
Aha.
and then suddenly you hear  the dog goes running off and he's bit its ear!
So he goes to see his mother who's a nurse  at the 
Aha.
school where he lives, cos she's the nurse, like a matron, and er  she said  Garth!
What's this?
Was it its ear ?
The dog's ear .
It's a little triangle of the dog !
Oh no!
I mean it was cruel 
Oh my God!
but it was funny cos he just  aargh!
Like this .
Ah ah ah!
The dog went off yelping.
Bless its little cotton socks.
Bet that didn't release its natural endorphin.
Ah  
Ah.
We'll have a slow mosey.
Mhm.
I find, tell you what I find difficult   is thinking and  learning in that class.
Mm.
Some of the people aren't conducive to learning.
I know.
I know.
And I try not to get stroppy, I try to be  you know, otherwise I'm being a complete crab and not joining in, but 
Mhm.
I've found  I have to have a lot of  conditions.
Everything has to be just so for me to be able to learn.
It has to be right.
I mean half the time I think I don't remember anything because er er, people are so busy blooming  playing around and 
Mhm.
shouting and 
And I'm too nosey to block things out.
and
When I was sitting in that corridor there was one of the tutors on the phone, only for a short while 
 
and I couldn't even blot him out cos I was too nosey to listen to what he was talking about.
 
I don't think it's deliberate.
But I'm 
No.
I'm reading 
Just curious.
I'm aware of it.
Naturally curious.
I can't revise when I know that Geoff's in.
If he is, I go upstairs  to be by myself.
The telly has to be off.
Well you see I have to have the telly very quiet  and last night, ah!
To I'm sure he's going deaf you know.
Mm mm.
And I, I keep going down and I'll turn it down, and then I'll go out room and he turns it back up again.
It's like living with a   cantankerous old man !
It's enough to make you deaf.
What?
Well the sound quality's not very good.
I says, well I can hear it upstairs!
 
He says well you're 
The trouble is 
you're just over-sensitive!
what you can hear upstairs is going, ooh ooh, ooh ooh!
Oh!
Ooh ooh!
And the music!
Yeah.
The theme tunes that are on.
Oh !
Dear me!
I wish it was that.
Well I'll go and get two, three.
I'll soon get  Oh yeah.
Yeah.
Well that's your fault.
I was saying I thought she was lovely!
Yeah.
Exclusive to  
Mm mm.
Mm mm.
Yeah.
It's nearly time for Neil.
    

I'm cold now.
It's cold in here.
The nights are drawing in.
Impact and intervention  
A ball?
bodily functions .
The Newcastle College of Health Studies Ball .
Yeah?
Erm, yes.
Twenty pound a ticket!
That's what it was last time wasn't it?
Meal, disco and band.
Well, can I tell you the first one we went to  we went to get food and there was none left!
Well that'll be on the .
And there was a lovely spread!
But by the time we got there, and there was  and there was people there I've never even seen before in my life!
I suppose this one's  it's cheap.
That was, it's always the one beside the Civic Centre one?
Yeah.
The one you went to when I was ill?
It's good like.
Yeah.
If you can get in.
It was me and Clare dancing on the table there.
difficult to get in.
At least it was just us and we were gonna
Well have you seen Helen's video?
No.
No.
Nobody has.
Oh!
It's brilliant.
Have you,can I ask, have you got pink in your hair?
Yeah, I've  I sprayed it pink for the Rocky Horror and I can't get it out!
I was, I keep looking and I'm thinking
Is it pink?
it's the light.
It's the light.
It's still a bit pinky.
Just a little bit.
Was it good?
The Rocky Horror?
It was brilliant!
Eh!
It took four shampoos to, to get the bugger out!
I thought it was my eyesight.
No.
No.
I love the Rocky Horror Show!
Anyway, she's got the erm  video right
Mm.
and there's a bit with Helen  and Steve and you know what Helen was like when they was 
Steve?
drunk.
Big Steve.
And sh 
Oh!
Right.
they showed it to, to me.
It was 
her face!
And, and Ellen was gonna bring it into college but ca er Helen said don't you dare!
So she's, she's 
Yeah.
cut out that bit.
That bit.
Ellen cut it off.
Oh!
Oh!
Yeah.
Cut it?
Yeah.
So, it was ever so bad  apparently !
It was really good.
Everyone was on it.
Everyone was having a good time.
It was really good.
Well th maybe I should look at it seeing as I missed it.
I can just remember Helen's bum!
You were in hospital.
That's all I saw all night!
Denise.
What on?
That do at
Aye.
I just remember her backside wherever I saw always Helen's backside.
I think they should have another one.
Seeing as I missed it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And come back with Mark .
I spent my whole night following him around!
Following him round.
And you, and  with Steve, Ellen can pick it out.
Oh have you?
Well you shouldn't have cos we wanted to see
I've seen it and, and it was the best 
 
the best time I had was .
 

It was good.
Right.
Am I telling you 
 
about this?
Yeah.
Sorry.
Have I made much sense so far?
Yeah.
Yeah, but I  the man 
Can I 
the patient looks  outside in  and carer  looks inside out.
Inside out.
Right.
And here's, here's his journey right.
G P appointment, outpatient appointment, tests, admission, medical treatment, nursing care,planning and follow-up.
And that's the patient from his journey out?
That's his journey right?
Here, he's looking in  how he came, where is it?
Route.
Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba
But is it the round window, the square window, or the arched window?
There's one.
Da, da, dee dee dee.
Right, it says here,quality can only be asse assured ,pa beg your pardon,if both patient's view, he's looking 
in there.
Right.
in, and the care-givers view looking out are in agreement .
Right.
What if they're not?
What 
To a 
is the one that we're actually doing?
Yeah.
That's right.
To achieve this  quality assurance should mean, that when the patient feels his care is not good  he should know how he can complain without any worry that he will be penalized, and in the certainty that action will be taken immediately .
And that's these things here.
There's patient questionnaires, complaints, da da, er  ba la  visitor inspections, complaints, patient questionnaire, there's a  basically all the same kind of thing, or relative survey.
Patient questionnaire.
So, basically, what they're saying there's all these things that they'll provide at each stage of his journey so that if care isn't right he knows what channels to go through to complain.
My criticism of that being is
But what if it's not carried out?
it's, it's al the quality's not there to start with.
How can you
He da he won't know what, what quality of care is though.
Well er, the patient has his views about what
Yeah.
he expects, good nursing care 
But his views aren't really gonna be necessarily good nursing care cos a lot of people wouldn't know 
No, everybody's individual.
And to get, what it says here, to get quality assurance, the patient's views, and the care-giver's views have to be in agreement.
What, say you're the care-giver and I'm the 
Yeah.
patient  what I think is good nursing care might not be what you think is good nursing care.
But what you know is not gonna be the same.
It has to be the same for quality assurance.
But it's not gonna be the same.
But that will 
Yeah cos you 
I tell you what I think
It says on our research thing 
say that, say that erm    .
Say that 
Er, say yes to that one.
I shan't ask anything.
But will it tell me the truth?
Well, see, for one is she's not erm  as bad as that.
You know, some patients I could think of seem to have the idea that everything should be done for them in hospital
Mm.
and that to them is good care if a nurse does everything for them, but it's not.
If, you're taking all  
Yeah.
Mm.
And when he goes into 
Plus they also say that a nurse is always 
 
busy  and they're angels, and they're, that and the other, that they won't complain.
Well that's the only way that this can be  assessed, is by, so that the patient  blah blah la    when a patient feels his care is not good he knows he can complain without any worry .
But complaining, I mean, if he's gotta complain it means that  quality assurance isn't there.
But
This is only thing if they've got something to complain about.
if you were the patient  nurse 
So there's nothing to actually say 
In a positive sense?
Yeah.
Yeah.
The only thing that 
So if it 
says
Yeah.
erm   meaning ha blah blah  and action taken .
It should also mean that when Mr , that's it, says the nurses were marvellous, the nurses are able to say in all evidence, and with evidence to support their opinion, yes 
We were crap!
we are really doing a pretty good job.
 
That's all it says in a positi from a positive angle.
Yeah but
A pretty good job.
So what do you think ?
But like, if you take like 
 
like er,le let me, if you were the patient and Lesley was the nurse  like, you wouldn't have a clue  whether it was er
Exactly.
good or not, because as long as it was pretty clean.
Let's have a look what examples they're using.
 
Well that's what I was trying to say, because all the patient doesn't know what to expect anyway.
I mean, the patient wouldn't know whether it was like clean  
Well these are the criteria leaves for tests and investigations for tests and investigations, for example good facilities, up-to-date working equipment, nice staff, competent qualified staff
Well I'm not nice.
written and verbal information, appropriate tests, no complications .
But not necessarily the procedure itself.
If you, if you were the patient you might say it's wrong because erm  she doesn't look like she knows what she's doing or  there's a mistake or  something gets missed.
Yeah.
You know.
But I mean, on that, well I think it's  
Well I think the whole point of it is 
erm, the patient's not gonna know that I'm, first of all, not gonna know anything about nurses,
Yeah.
Because he didn't, he stayed cos they class him as an A person.
And he might take a personal dislike to one of nurses.
Yeah.
They can only evaluate the care that they've had 
 
can't they?
At the end of their stay.
Whether they, they feel, they feel better and whether that's because the nurses have done a good job or not.
So ideally, er
Nurses can, they can only  they can only  say evaluate a certain proportion of the erm
Yeah.
things in question.
Well it says for the nurses to  is to be able to evaluate.
Waiting list monitoring, outpatient department review, observation, visits  erm  nursing audit, medical audit, care review, qualifications check .
Well you see the bit about the waiting 
You know it's all very 
list right?
Mm.
That's one thing here, will get them in and out, but I've spoken to patients who say they don't get the care here  and, on the surface it looks a brilliant hospital, it gets them in and out, you know, it does everything, it's got all the facilities  but it doesn't give them the care.
Mm.
I think the biggest 
 
bogey is, is where 
That's right.
it says,quality can only be assured if both patient's view and care-giver's view are in agreement  cos that's gonna be really hard to achieve isn't it?
Yeah.
Where's it say that?
Make sure I've written it down.
Yes, but quality doesn't just co erm, take into account the care that's given, it takes into  erm, what equipment you've got on, whether th er, the equipment's used properly.
I mean, but that  that is what I was pointing out  and we have some, say you have somebody qualified to go and visit each patient 
What the hell's a ?
even just to like  I feel we're doing the research do you know what I mean?
Mhm.
Mm.
Yeah.
I will say that.
What about yours Neil?
Come on Neily.
Hang on, I've lost my, my work.
back too soon.
That's wishful thinking.
Wears my out.
I've got my husband's on.
What?
Socks .
Not the same ones as yesterday?
No, I've got about five, no  I've got about four pairs the same.
Two pairs of blue and two pairs of red.
You mean your husband's got four pairs?
Well  Mm.
Right.
My art 
Thirteen centre.
My
Sorry.
my article's about  raising the standards of health care in the hospitals.
It's all the same really.
And it, it looks upon nurses feel about  their own standard of care  and, the article then goes on about
Standard they provide?
standard they provide for 
Mm.
the patients.
And then the it goes on about setting up  the single but dynamic standards  a setting system it's called, divided into  local level groups like a tier system, you get the Managing Director on the top  and the ones at the bottom.
And they're called quality assurance, or standard setting teams  made up of volunteers
from the local wards.
The main base made up of volunteers from the local wards like nurses and  well I mean  nurses and auxiliaries  like that.
But it's  bring, it says things about care  and assessing that quality care's being met on their ward and  the hospital itself  and  about once every six months to meet up with
other hos members of other hospitals in the area and discuss  different aspects of  raising the standards  of care.
And the introduction about  about care is passed up the three tiers, like a triangular system's 
Mm.
passed up a three tier system.
And if the ideas are good  then er incorporated  into the care, they're incorporated into the  hospital's  manifesto if you want, if you like.
But there's one  one fault really it takes approximately fifteen to eighteen months for them to pass  anything like that  and that could be one
Downfall.
downfall, one criticism  about
Yeah, cos this one says it's immediate.
Yeah.
Well this one takes fifteen to eighteen months and that's  to me that's just  ridiculous really.
And then, it would take another  however to implement any changes that they decided upon.
Basically they, they just provide the ideas which get passed 
They provide the er 
to the top of the ladder
That's it.
and then 
And they're the ones in the situation so they get pa they're the ones who are actually on the ward at the bottom and then pass it up.
It's like 
Yeah.
being in parliament really, you have to pass everything up.
Well the thing is though people at the top don't necessarily see the problems that you see as problems 
No they don't, no.
as being problems do they?
That's probably why it takes fifteen to eighteen months to get a a result.
To get there.
It's not gonna help the patient like, at the time, like, at the time if your patient complains, something will be done.
What happens there and then?
If your patient complained, like, I dunno
Probably be dead by the time
Gone out the window!
Yeah!
What if you've got a loved one?
And, and we  sort of no yours doesn't necessarily apply to some people to say, they might just think, oh it'll be 
I know.
good idea to
Just  what you think.
Yes, by the time it comes to getting round to your complaint you've moved on.
Mm mm.
It's unbelievable how many they .
So is that it basically?
If you want to call an issue but  I was on about setting up these committees  to assess the standard of care.
I've got a bit like that, and says the  erm  quality assurance systems will have to be different in each health district, with like being variations.
But it says, it has identified key elements, and one of those elements is a Director of Quality Assurance should 
Yeah.
be appointed with responsibility for setting up the district-wide programme.
She would receive minutes of all meetings and have the right to attend these meetings to provide a quality assurance input.
So that's the same
And like I must have got the  er the review board should be  er  six  six requirements for these groups.
Mm mm.
They must voluntary to the whole .
Right.
Erm, there must be more than six people.
There must be a meeting once every three or four weeks for one and a half hours.
And the meeting should be held in a place where it is possible to work in our situation.
And a leader should be appointed.
Yeah.
Yeah, but even with all those things in their favour it still takes fifteen months?
It still takes fifteen to eighteen months to deliver  to pass
But the leaders are nearly always someone  like a Director of Nursing or somebody like that, who has no  ward  experience
But you need somebody higher up 
on a day to day 
to be able to pass these bills doesn't it?
To be able to pass the
, yeah, try to get them to pass it.
Right.
It cannot be  get background.
