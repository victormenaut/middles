to go, weren't they?
The household went 
Their, the homes the homes were probably
Then there, a lot of wearing lots of clothing 
 
and not washing much, was there?
In spite of that it was probably more comfortable than the home that they'd left anyway.
Yeah, yeah.
The church.
They wouldn't want to wash very often, would they?
No.
Keep the dirt on them, keep warm.
Smell of it.
Well everybody, everybody smelt the same, didn't they?
Yes, yes they wouldn't notice it.
They all, they all huddled together and then when they started to get warm it'd pong a bit, wouldn't it?
It would that, yes.

it's not worth going,
What, you're still going to  are you?
Mm
 
Mm yeah Thursday and it, it says Tuesday in the paper and it's Thursday.
It has been for a, a while now
Yeah.
cos they don't open Tuesday, they don't  and it's, anyhow 
 
it's the last one, the last one next month in May.
The third Thursday in May is the last one.
But we had nobody been for a couple of times, now.
I've just got it going again and I really have to make the effort.
This is what I say, I ought to make the effort to come to this French!
They're all enjoying it 
Well that's finished.
very much.

Is he?
Yeah, he's gonna have er, he's gonna go on from there, go on advanced.
Oh.
So we've, we've missed this one this morning 
Mm.
I think we ought to, if we could make it a certain day of the week, something to do with U V A.
One Tuesday  and the other Tuesday have a  local history and third Tuesday have something else.
The Tuesday of each 
Ah, but well we do, we do that, we do 
No we don't.
We have Wednesdays and Thursdays.
Oh yes!
Oh I see what you mean.
You mean one Tuesday  
That's because, that's because there's too many!
Too many.
No, but there'd be a good four, wouldn't there, at least four.
A Tuesday in a month 
Oh yeah, I see what you mean, yeah 
have one
Mm, mm
make Tuesday, or Wednesday or Thursday for the U V A. 
Yeah, but the trouble with it there is that  very often you get, you get half of them say we can't come Tuesday, but we can come Wednesday
Oh yes!
Most people most people we find can, can go Wednesday and Thursday  
Yes, well 
That counts 
whatever days, whatever 
That's right.
day.
He's, he's, he's, he's one of these  you get  if you aren't careful you can get so committed with  
Well this is, this is why I think  may be able to go to French 
 
and er I, really when I hear 
 
how, how well they've enjoyed it this morning I thought well I wished I'd made the effort 
Yeah 
but, even, I like this, I like this local history all very 
Yes 
interesting.
Yeah.
Erm your bridge class clashed with me Town's Women's Guild committee meeting so that was that, so
Yes.
erm I think if you're on a committee you have a right to
To
attend
ex exactly if you're on the committee.
Anyway I'm  
Are you?
Well, I know we're rather looking forward to May when it, when it finishes till September
Yes, well yes 
Yes, so we can have a rest.
I mean, no really 
Do you know, I didn't want to say 
we 
anything but I thought you were looking, beginning to look a bit tired.
Are you feeling tired?
 
We are, well I'm not so 
Yes.
not so well at the moment because I've got a stinking cold.
Oh that's it, is it?
Yeah.
Yeah.
But erm we, we wer went up to our son's in Inverness about fortnight, three weeks ago 
Oh yes, mm, yes.
and I'll tell you this, we were glad to have nine days doing nothing.
Yes.
Just sat there and we felt better for it.
Mm well that's one of the reasons I haven't involved 
We, we were getting tense!
in so much, yeah.
Even at weekends we  there's nothing Saturday and Sunday, but  somebody that we'd lived with in West Yorkshire called us.
We'd a couple call last weekend that were in 
Yeah, well you're on their way to the coast from West Riding, aren't you?
They are, yeah.
Yeah well, you see, we found that for the first three or four years now they've gradually dropped off a bit, but they did used to, I mean they still come, but it  
It's nice to see them int it?
Oh yeah.
Betty , is it Betty  that er goes to the er, it's in the er, goes to the tea dances.
She's a little lady 
Oh Bet Betty ?
Betty , no.
No .
Her husband's a tall fellow.
He's had er, he's had heart trouble that's why he doesn't go dancing.
Betty?
Betty?
Anyhow, he, he bakes bread and he was talking about it the other day and I said oh that's lovely homemade bread.
It, just before we set off they came round in the car and they had a loaf for me.
Lovely!
He said I'll give you the recipe.
I made a mistake, like Margaret said, you're not  enough yet you, you, you'd never learn, you would.
And I said, ooh I wouldn't mind making bread.
Well, people take me up on it and he's 
Oh!
and so he came round with the bread and he said I'll let you have the recipe and I thought, so I am now 
So?
committed to making bread.
Bread good.
I'll have to make some now.
You'll have to make some little baps and bring them 
No, no, you know that, this is Margaret says I ain't never saying anything unless I'm sure I want to.
She said I, I, I linger and when I've thought about it I say yes,
Well, it's very difficult, yeah 
alright.
 
But, you know, you, don't you, you go straight in without thinking.
Oh, I think I've only once made bread in all my life.
I remember me mother with a great big earthenware  
Oh aye!
She used to have this in, in front, in front of the old fire .
Yellow inside.
Yes.
I've got plants growing in it at the moment.
Well,Jo Joan, Joan there she, she, she can make the most marvellous cakes and scones and everything else.
She's only once tried to make some bread.
She made this bread, put it on the table, the table went 
So heavy!
We couldn't, we couldn't get through it.
We, we, we, we threw, we threw it out into the garden and these birds swooped down and they couldn't take off!
Oh go on!
They couldn't take off.
They were flapping round on the
They were so excited at getting something   
They were so, they were so heavy, they were so heavy, they were so heavy
What's he asking me?
Talking about your baking.
How the birds couldn't take off  
 
Bread?
Yes.
Yes.
It's the only thing I can't make!
I can, can do all, all sorts 
Have you seen, have you seen that, that little lady that goes to  Betty, Betty something  
I think we could be moving.
She's in the bowling club.
Oh you mean the little one that goes with Mary?
Aye, I know who you mean now.
talking to him last night, he makes bread.
He loves it.
See it's one of his hobbies and he goes to, he goes to er Bradshaws and he 
Yeah.
asks, he gets it, it's called Brad something special, brown 
Special flour
brown flour and, and, anyway they called round just before we set off.
They waltzed round in the car and they had this brown loaf warm out of the oven for me.
Really?
It smelt beautifully.
Oh!
And, and he said I, because, because when they were talking Joan, I mean, like Margaret said, it's worth thinking first before you open your mouth
Yes.
and he said  
They could er 
making bread well he says I, you know, I'll give you the recipe and you're committed now, you know.
You're gonna have to have a go!
she says you've, you've had it, you're right in so you better get yourself organized.
I, I, I would like to but I haven't thought it seriously enough about it, but when I smelt that I thought 
Well I've got a couple of er bridge loaf tins that you can borrow.
Loaf tins?
Oh, I've got a couple of loaf tins.
We had one er  you know, the eldest daughter she makes all her own bread  
My mother used to do.
Oh so did mine.
Great big earthenware things.
We were just talking about that 
Earthenware  
Every, every Thursday, coming home from school 
She'd be pounding
Yes!
Best thing to do is do a bit of gardening then go in and bake the bread.
It puts a bit of flavour in.
It cleans your hands!
 
It cleans your hands!
 
Yes!
Put a bit flavour in your loaf of bread.
Bit of compost in it.
Me mother used to make loaves and then she had a set of 
  
a set of little tiny loaf tins and we all, she always used to make these little ones, you know, that's mine, that's me brother's,
Oh yes  
that me sister's each time.
That was your tea  oh I can still remember this now.
And when we moved to Manchester the thing I missed were things called sally loaves and you don't 
Oh yeah!
and you don't see them here now!
Great big ones!
Yes, sally loaves.
But do you know, me cousin Eric, who's quite a lot older than me, was at Scarborough with me Uncle  and  and his mother and dad and he was only a little one and he was stood in that narrow street that goes off, off the  
Yeah, yeah I know 
He stood there, cos something had happened, and he's stamping his feet he says and I won't, I won't say our father and I won't have any sally  for me supper either.
Oh I used to love sally loaves and you cut them off that way 
Yes, yes.
You cut them that way.
And they had icing on them, did they have icing?
No, no there was currants, the fruits.
Like a teacake, wasn't it?
Like a fruit teacake 
Yes a great yes a great one but then when we got to Manchester it was all baps!
We didn't know what baps were!
So we went there
Well it still won't know what's hit it when it arrives, I mean
I just realized  Trevor isn't 
Oh is it?
here today?
He's alright 
No he's 
is he?
Oh yes, well he's not a, a bit, a nasty cold but it, you know, he's alright, no 
Not very good  
And Scrabble at your house tomorrow?
Tomorrow, yes.
Oh that's jolly convenient for the p erm go and put me little cross on the way then.
Yes.
Oh well, we're going after we've been 
Yeah, well we're put  morning.

You're floating towards the school in the morning, this morning?
Yes.
Oh, really?
Yes,take me velvet
See you tomorrow for the Scrabble?
Er, yes all being well we will, yeah.
Erm I was  last night because I was all ready to come and the telephone rang and it was one of those 
Oh  
upsetting people on the other side and 
Oh.
and I hadn't the heart to tell  
No.
Something over my son's wedding and she was in tears
Oh dear!
oh this is just  when she felt she had to talk
Yes.
at about twenty past two  I did a good deed for the day.
Well you did, yes.
I'll grant you your reward in heaven.
 
If not before!
Not too soon I hope!
Not too soon, no.
All these rewards that you're waiting for  and you don't find anyone there .
I'm afraid there'll be an awful counterbalance somewhere along the line.
Oh gosh!
I'm sure there will.
I'm sure there will, yes.
Oh Mary's going out for a drink as well.
Oh she is?
Mm  tell her I'll see her some time
Yes, righto.
She hasn't found a house yet 
She is thinking of going 
has she?
Er she said not
No, she's hoping to go to  yeah.
Anyway, I'm glad you're better  
Yes, I'm fine.
No, no more   cos it can last for such a long time sometimes, you know.
Yes, so they say!
Somebody was telling me it took her four years!
I thought oh my God!
Don't want that .
Bye!
I was thinking about the Wigan one.
Aye, I know that, that's the one she was 
Oh, oh, cos 
yes, well she, yes, I mean er, I  say to her  really.
I mean I try every now again but it, you end up  you're gonna end by talking about them and
Mm.
child
Yes.
and what  used to do and that's it.
Then of course it sort of all brings all back to him.
Yeah.
He says, well if you don't bother.
But no, I just er added, added to them  and I didn't have a letter to say that er, you know, they were coming.
Well I think if it was a flying visit  
 
as I say, none of mine came but carried on there I went home again .
back home.
Yes.
Yes.
But erm, no, I, I don't really 
No, apparently Dul Dulcie didn't know who, who was who anyway.
No, that would be I don't really think of that when I, I don't think  I don't think anybody went to see her, but I think she'd been done a bit better.
Sheila had this letter anyway
Oh.
so er
I was, I was alright at the weekend, that's my Darlington meeting  and she was talking to one of the  boys erm  the one that lives at Filey.
And she'd been talking to him for about half an hour and well er her son had come up
Yes.
and  not Norman, it's the other one   one of them anyway, he said hello Christopher where's your mum?talking for half an hour!
He just hadn't recognized who she was!
 
And that isn't so long since they'd seen her 
Ah, well it
I can't remember the name 
Because if, if you get a letter from somebody and you think oh, it's lovely I'll, I'll do something about that.
Well, you see when it comes to it  that's it you can do about replying.
Yeah
So I believe at one time 
Oh well  reply the girl I used to work with  wrote to me this morning.
Aye.
Er  got to arrange a meeting at Pocklington cos she lives at York so we, I go through to Pocklington have a lunch and then return 
That'd, that'd be quite  
and we both come back because the buses are quite convenient, they seem 
I was gonna say 
to meet in Pocklington
Aye
you know there's not nobody got half an hour to wait.
No, nobody got, no.
If it's a wet day you're mucking about.
No.
So it's a good idea.
No.
Well we had a lovely walk  in the er water gardens at Pocklington.
Aye.
It was nice.
That's another one.
Are there any people who are sixteen, seventeen?
No then, no then
I tell you what.
I've got my er seventeen year old granddaughter staying with me for the time being 
Have you?
and it frightens me to death the way they go out.
It really does.

I know 
how the, she expects to get her A level exams I just don't know.

Yes.
Do you have any timetables

or anything?
the only thing I have is  to Scarborough.
No!
The only information I have, I'm afraid cos that's as far as  
Well, where do I get the information then?
Who from?
Erm, I would think you'll either have to get it from Scarborough or Whitby.
Is it Staithes?
Yes, it's erm  about  I think at Whitby.
Yeah.
It's a different bus company,
Er ri 
you see.
Ah well, can you, have you

To take the tops off now  I don't always I think well what does nature do?
Nothing!
So 
No 
I don't do  
But with a, it's just that er if you have er  in the wrong place it'll look a bit untidy with the other things coming up when the bulbs are dying down.

Some people have had them with a solid roof
Yes, you can see right across.
Do you try to take all the tops off as they die off?
Well, we started, we started
but as the time goes on.
I took a few off this morning, but you see there's still a few  
Yeah I tell myself that, that they don't get taken off in nature so I leave them
Yeah
mainly.
Well I, we do mainly, but what we do is, we, we cut them, when they die off, we cut them right down under ground
Oh do you?
Do you wait till they go, the leaves go really yellow or  
Oh no, no.
Well no, because you've got to get something else in really.
That's it!
Yes!
You know, let them die off a bit 
Mm
and then, well we leave the daffies  and then when the tulips have died off we take the lot 
Oh yes yes.
Oh and you just sort of

I saw some, my erm people at the bottom of the garden were having their lunch out in the garden  
We, we had our lunch at  
but they were right out in the open  breakfast and all the meals out here.
Yes.
I've got me jigsaw on that board that's what, and I've covered it over with a cloth because I don't want the sun to fade it cos it's  hard enough to do as it is !
Oh yes!
Yes, that's right.
It'll change it, won't it?
Oh I'm not, I don't like jigsaws very much  
I do but I've got so many other things to do I haven't got time.
Well, I had this one bought at Christmas  and I've only just got him persuaded to let me bring the board down to do it downstairs cos you, where are we going to put it?
Well you get hooked once you start, don't you?
Yeah, you do 
I, I daren't start!
I get frustrated if I can't see something immediately that goes in somewhere.
Oh, do you?
Oh I don't mind that 
I get awfully frustrated.
I find it  
I, I think this is going to be a very difficult one cos there's a lot very near the same shade but 
Yes 
Mm
they are shaded 
How many pieces?
How many pieces?
One thousand five hundred.
Summer's come!
Summer's come!
Well let's hope it stays!
Yeah.
It came about a month ago, didn't it?
Although we shall be grumbling for water, shan't we?
Yeah.
Oh we've had plenty of water for the time being.
Be grumbling for water.
Oh I don't think so not for what they, what they, they want.
No, no.
I'm just not dedicated I'm afraid.
I just let the garden go   
Well it's a, I'm afraid it's just getting 
So many other things to do!
too much.
I, I really jiggered myself this morning and I was only out about half an hour, you know, and I used to be able to do a full day!
yeah.
No you can't.
and er there's enough to do at the front and the back .
The front has got to be tidy  I did a bit last night when I went out.
Can't you put gravel in your front?
I don't like gravel.
Oh I don't mind!
I think it looks quite nice.
I've seen two of all these houses I walked round at Bridlington, I thought all the gravel looked quite nice, you know, with the odd plant and  and things through the gravel.
And er  did you enjoy your tea yesterday with  I didn't come because er I thought 
Yes!
Yes!
Thank you 
I might go back and get er, get me grass cut  
Yeah.
They were silly little coffee cups that came round and
and part of that is it's a long walk back from the 
It was, was a long walk, yes.
I should imagine  
Yes.
I mean you've such a long walk, haven't you, haven't you?
So I thought right, I'm gonna give that 
Well I
yes, I got a bit tired out because erm somebody mentioned table tennis and I said oh I've been wanting a game for years!
I, I got sick of asking around and gave up  
Ooh!
er somebody said well the, the table's, we'd been to French in the morning and I hadn't realized that the table's 
Yes, in the youth club.
in the youth club
Yes.
and erm they'd sort of asked and said, you know, it's possible.
So there are two tables there.
So we were talking about this  and 
Erm, no I'm 
what's her name Mrs erm  was there, Margaret  and she said oh I have a table!
You can come round now and have a game.
I said oh no, not then!
She said well come and see, she said, and then any time any of you want a game come, I thought that was very sweet of her!
Very nice!
I mean we wouldn't want to keep traipsing through her house every time 
Where does she live?
Er Land's Park
Oh!
just round the corner!
Yes!
So we went round then, oh that was lovely too and erm cos she made 
How many 
tea but I didn't stay 
how many er is interested in the table tennis?
Well, there was about four of us.
Mm cos I found I'd try, well the works had er, erm table and I, I remember the last time I played before I left and I said come on, I'll 
Mm.
Not for me
No.
it's too energetic and too, you've got to have to, got an eye  
You've got to watch that ball.
Yes, yes 
and it was always the picking up and the speed of it and so I thought well I, I 
Yes, oh  
  

Ah!
so no don't say  
Yes 
that.
Well no, it's frustrating because that's how I 
I make the best of it, but er I  
felt all these years that I 
Mm, mm 
hadn't had enough and now
Yeah
and erm well, of course, then somebody suggested oh what about Scottish country dancing?
Cos the  so erm I said oh, I'd love Scottish country dancing!
You are going to get some bread, are you?
she ever will do!
I don't think she wants to go home!
No!
I got home and I felt that's it!
If I can do table tennis and Scottish country dancing, nothing won't get me away from that.
So I, I spent the night thinking oh dear, have I done the wrong thing now?
 
But if anything comes of this table tennis and Scottish country dancing that'll be  
Well, it'll be nice if you get a club going at the youth club, because they won't use it in the morning  
That's right!
not the early afternoons, will they?
That's it!
I'm, I'm coming to your house next month.
Yeah
 
It is a long way, isn't it?
I don't think I shall be there next month!
Well, you, aren't you doing some teas?
I was supposed to do it yesterday!
I'd, you see, as you know, I missed 
Oh well 
all winter
Yes.
and I said to Joan, when she was on about churches, well you can come to  for a cup of tea, you see?
Yes, that was what we thought.
Aye!
But then you see, she said that she thought it was too many so she put it to 
were, were quite a lot, weren't there?
No!
Could've managed to cook her tea, couldn't we?
Yeah.
But I said  
 
May or June.
So  
No 
No 
So
But people don't mind taking their own cup with them, do they?
I, I mean I was a bit disappointed yesterday cos it was a good do 
Oh!

It was!
The, I say 
Poor girl!
and the cups were so  weren't they?
And we didn't even have a biscuit, did we?
No!
How much did she charge  
Thirty pence.
Well it wasn't that much thirty pence, but I mean we, it was, well they'll have to buck up their ideas,
But Joan 
won't they?
yes, but Joan asked at the end, didn't she, if it would be possible for us to use that for history and they said yes 
Oh did she?
as long as we just pay for the 
I see 
Oh!
and I said to  we could use it so
Rather than go to the school?
Yes, I think so, so 
I thought you, I thought you were sort of more, more or less settled in this 
I don't know!
youth club?
Well, I don't know cos I haven't been to any meetings for months, not 
It's a long walk down 
since last 
It belong well I found cycling

Yes!
and I thought I'm never going to get there!
Well I studied an art class in the school and it took me twenty five minutes to walk from my house.
It is for you, yeah.
It would do!
Except we reckon half 
it's even further 
an hour when we're going to school.
Yes!
And most people had lifts yesterday to the French  on the way up  
Yes, mm, oh yes.
You could arrange a lift, but that's in case you can't get a lift, that's how long it takes you.
It is a long way up to that school I know, when, you know by 
And then there's the  int it?
Well this is it!
Once you get to the school you think you're there!
But you're not!
But you're not!
No!
Oh Jean, there's a walk meeting at your house, isn't there?

You see, mm
