Report set to spark debate
A CHURCH leaders' dream arising from the nightmare of Northern Ireland's ‘troubles’ is about to become a reality.
The inter-church document tackling the issue of sectarianism has been five years in the making.
Reports of highbrow church committees are often of only limited interest but this 150-page document due next month should be read avidly across the province.
Proposal
The long awaited inter-church working party discussion report on sectarianism is expected to create debate between and among all denominations, and even beyond the Christian churches.
The group was set up in 1986 after a proposal at one of the regular — though often far apart — meetings of the four main Church leaders by Church of Ireland Primate Archbishop Robin Eames, and seconded by the late Catholic Primate Cardinal Tomas O'Fiaich.
But according to veteran peace campaigner Dr Eric Gallagher — now retired but still busy — the idea of a joint initiative on sectarianism dates back to Cardinal Conway's day.
