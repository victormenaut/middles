In the Echoey Tunnel
The little girl squealing
in the echoey tunnel,
scampering and squealing
just for the thrill of it,
spanking the pathway
with her own stampede of footfalls
and squealing, squealing
to make the brickwork tingle —
how fiercely she exults
in her brand-new discovery,
the gift of the tunnel
and its echoey gloom!
And then what a cheat,
to be dragged back to daylight!
A View of the Playground
Out on the playground someone was producing bubbles:
not the small ones you get
by breathing through a spoon-sized hole,
but enormous creatures, perhaps even a yard across.
It was too far to make out what the apparatus was,
but where their filmy skins caught the light
you could see them writhe and roll
off and up into the air with mighty shudders and wobbles.
People came to watch them.
Their lives were so wretchedly brief,
their passing so abrupt,
it was hard not to admit
to some dark significance in their dumb carnival.
And I suspect all our hearts floated with them, until,
growing too sausage-shaped,
or at the mercy of a trembling fit,
they would burst with the peremptoriness of a sneeze or a cough.
I could have stood at the window all afternoon,
utterly beguiled
by this most otherworldly of peepshows,
but then a teenaged boy, rather fat and muscular, raced up.
He began throwing himself about in his wild efforts to pop
as many fragile monsters as he could.
I hated him at once, and I suppose
others did too, but nobody, I noticed, attempted to intervene.
Thy Doom
Some afternoons all London goes mad —
and I don't mean just the odd bearded weirdo
who stands on an island denouncing buses,
or skew-whiff old biddy with institution hair-do
looking like a lost child so far from her nurses;
but the whole city, all London, goes mad.
You feel it could well be the end of everything.
The sky grieves under its load of darkness
and the rules of perspective seem about to be broken,
leaving each person with his/her separate sickness —
a trancelike estrangement from which no one will waken
if this is, as you suspect, the end of everything.
Amphibiology
Like old men frolicking in sacks
seals slither on the sea-thrashed rocks.
Why does their melancholy sport
exert such a strong pull on my heart?
I could stand here for hours on end
watching them fail to make dry land.
From time to time one gains brief purchase,
adopting the pose of a Grand Duchess.
In seconds, though, a fist of surf
rises to swipe the pretender off.
Repetitive slapstick, it has the charm
of earliest documentary film.
Stuffed statesmen and wind-up warriors
turn to salute us across the years…
Only, in this case, something far
more ancient seems to hang in the air.
It could be the question, whether to plump
for a great evolutionary jump
or stay put in the icy brine.
May the good Lord send them a hopeful sign!
Contretemps
One lunchtime two men got in a fight.
The first tried to land a punch, but he missed.
Next moment, a barstool tipped and crashed,
the whole pub dropped to a dead hush and a tight
little space like a night-club dance floor grew
around the two bruisers in their ungainly clinch.
It was not like the movies: there was no second punch
and no attempt at fancy throwing.
All they could do
was to totter on the spot, mutually clamped, grunting
and sputtering oaths, until one tripped and down
they both fell, still grappling.
Each wore a frown
as stubborn as the other's.
It recalled something
I'd seen long ago in a wild-life programme about
one of those grim, antiquatedly-armoured species
for whom the sexual act, through a whim of nature's,
has been made almost impossible to carry out.
Episode
Toddling from the ‘Harvest Bar’
into the brash glare of two-thirty,
he found this message on his car:
I AM DIRTY.
‘Too true!’ he thought, and with his fist
half-rubbed it out; then tyres burning,
made for the motorway, but missed
a vital turning.
The bodgy farmsteads and twee spires
of unknown England — bright clouds high
over interchangeable shires —
sped him by.
And what did the night hold?
Clearly, alas
he saw the inevitable scene:
dim hotel lamp, a sinking glass
and a magazine.
Hotels
In the first hotel
I opened my wardrobe
to an ambush from childhood:
a sweet, tugging fragrance
I couldn't name.
Shuttered windows
gave on to a blind drop
and the portamenti
of amorous cats.
In the second hotel
I noted that the wallpaper,
although of a strictly
geometrical pattern,
was upside-down.
A hornet arrived
the following morning,
loose-jointed, like a gunslinger.
Then it flew away.
In the third hotel
none of the corridors
ran into each other 
quite where expected.
My Gideon Bible
was marked at Lamentations 
by an envelope addressed
to Mrs Minnie Fireberg,
Utica, NY.
In the fourth hotel
I fell asleep
about nine o'clock.
Woke five hours later.
A woman in the street
was practising her giggling.
A bottle smashed.
Dawn crawled slowly
with its traffic chorus.
In the fifth hotel
the complimentary stationery
carried the most
vainglorious letterhead
I have ever seen.
Why didn't I steal some?
The plumbing shuddered
in every limb
at the twist of a single tap.
In the sixth hotel
the phone was pink
and its weight felt wrong
as I lifted the receiver.
It was no one I knew.
Advice and prohibitions
in several languages
were posted by the lightswitch
in a passepartout frame.
Caretaking
for Jane and Bernard McCabe
The seven-storey trees
on the jogger-thronged hill
beyond your back garden
register the breeze
with a convulsive thrill
of all their bright foliage,
a lightening of their burden
that I in turn acknowledge,
seated at your desk,
with the opulent awakening
of my own nerve-tree —
just in time to see
some strange woman beckoning,
her dog's doggy burlesque.
Following Maisie's
half-remembered map
of companionable smells,
obliged to stop
for the frequent delectation
of savoury breezes,
at last we reach the hill's
celebrated elevation
and there for a while we stand
with the usual kites flying,
joggers jogging,
lovers snogging,
and London itself lying
in the palm of the land.
Book shut, light out —
then in the gap
before real sleep
you feel the hill
looming closer,
then closer still,
a dreamlike imposture
that brings the trees'
lulling furor
right up to your ear,
and the monologue
of a distant dog
who more or less agrees
with what you have always thought.
One Star in the Michelin
The house at Giverny has been turned into a museum,
supported, you learn at the gate, by American funds.
A few francs get you into both house and grounds.
The main attraction is the celebrated garden,
Monet's home-made paradise, planted and painted by him
through the optical haze
of his long last days,
and now restored to trim after years of abandon.
We went in early October, when river mist —
or a fine drizzle — damped everything.
Cosmos,
path-smothering nasturtium, stiff autumn crocus
and clumps of busy Lizzie were in full bloom.
The effect was Japanese-cum-Impressionist:
a controlled disorder
at every border,
the whole canvas organised with immaculate aplomb.
The water-garden is a separate area
which you reach through a tunnel under the main road,
stepping into a disconcertingly familiar world.
On our visit, although the lily-pads
had lost their crowns and the stout grey wisteria,
lashed to its trellis,
was now flowerless,
remembered visions shimmered about our heads.
Following the path around a bush, we halted
as abruptly as if we had seen a ghost.
A lawn-sprinkler twirled its spray into the mist 
as if to replenish it, just where the old fellow
himself no doubt stood in his tweeds and contemplated
the rainbow bridge,
the tousled sedge,
the oriental fish and the weeping willow.
Tyger
Early one frost-spiked morning
I was walking north from Golden Square
in Soho, when — quite without warning —
I saw a troop of men appear
around a corner, dragging what seemed
to be a full-grown tiger in a cage.
Was it something I had dreamed?
It looked authentic enough: a huge
potential man-eater that displayed
its amber teeth in a masklike snarl,
while at the other end its tail swayed
time-bidingly…
Well,
I stood back and let them pass —
the beast on its rope-drawn carriage
and the men heaving with less fuss
than if it had been so much inert luggage.
Where had they come from?
Where were they bound?
The tarty boutiques and design studios
cluttering that part of town
were all shut up; ditto, the hideous,
tear-stained, granite clad, sixties block
whose steps are graced, you may remember,
by a sign saying,’ WILLIAM BLAKE
WAS BORN ON 28 NOVEMBER
1757
IN A HOUSE WHICH STOOD ON THIS SITE’.
So was it reality or vision?
Or just a trick of the morning light?
Two Teachers
Jolly Miss Chard
taught us ‘Hangman’—
her utterly compelling
game of spelling,
where a simple gallows
grew on the blackboard
strut by strut
as we made our mistakes,
until every stick limb
of the innocent victim
dangled before us
and the final foot
showed he was dead.
Such hilarious dismay
greeted the coup de grâce 
that the excited class
could generally persuade
nice Miss Chard
to begin again.
Solemn Mr Talbot
was in charge of sixth-formers —
all those enormous
twelve-year-olds —
but he once stood in 
for poor Miss Chard
when she was off sick.
He showed us a toy
that he had made as a boy:
a little square box
of painted wood
with a glass panel
set in the top,
like one of those gizmos
that tend to appear at Christmas,
in which a silver ball
wobbles along a runnel
before the player
loses control
and it drops to its doom.
Young Talbot's theme
had been Pilgrim's Progress.
With exquisite care
he had fashioned the route
from the City of Destruction
to the Celestial City,
with numerous witty
devices to stand
for the Wicket Gate,
the Slough of Despond,
Vanity Fair
and the whole rigmarole.
The tiddly ball
completed the journey
in his wrinkled hand.
French Cricket
The too speedily
flickering pulse
of old celluloid
between spools…
Odour of singed
house-dust rising
with its ambiguous greeting
from the machine…
All pictures
and knick-knacks removed,
that patch of wallpaper
again receives
the impermanent
but transfixing imprint
of a time that was:
the pageant and fuss
of by-gone, bourgeois
heyday afternoons
on picnic verges
and tennis lawns —
all that sunlight
unreliably translated
to the sputter and glare
operative here,
that can incandesce
without notice
and blot out an entire scene.
As when
some young girl
in high-waisted frock
and ankle socks,
lobbing a ball,
would remain swaying
for a few seconds
on one leg,
piquantly displaying
her emphatic ensellure .
Consulting the Oracle
An old, slow and sometimes forgetful lift
takes you up to her flat on the eighth floor.
You carry in your hand some trivial gift,
ready to thrust at her inside the door.
It is accepted and then promptly hidden
in the kitchen, where you have never been.
You'd like to peep, just once, but this is forbidden
by the laws of a now fixed routine.
She comes out with the tea things on a tray
and you go with her down the unlit hall
to the front room with its museumlike display
of gilt-framed studio photographs on each wall.
Conversation gets off to a limp start.
The unreliable buses.
Yesterday's snow.
What the new doctor says about her heart.
An aeroplane passes disconcertingly low.
You wonder why you've bothered, until by chance
your eye lights on a china hummingbird
and instantly she understands that glance
as an appeal.
The oracle is stirred.
It was one of a pair.
Its precious twin
was stolen by the soldiers.
All the time
her uncle stood there clutching this one in
his big fist — so!
She does a little mime.
With such authenticity, she too laughs.
You know that prim frown, that tilt of the head,
from numerous dressy family photographs,
most of whose subjects are, of course, long dead.
They can be traced from one frame to another:
the plump, horse-loving cousin who was raped…
the argumentative great-aunt…the lost brother…
the uncle in whose Daimler she escaped…
But that's enough.
There will be more next time.
You bite a biscuit and sip from your cup.
Chit-chat makes do until the wheezy chime
of five o'clock, whereupon you stand up.
And your departure follows a strict pattern,
with steps down the hall, coat on, and always three
kisses bringing you to the lift's black button,
which you jab more than once, jogging its memory.
Pips
(after Katerina Brac)
Knowledge
it's the cleverest trick
Eve taught Adam
you bite the pip
and taste the whole tree
Us
2
the way you write it
almost like a question mark
Company
it never lasts
but for a while you have
the cat's deep
satisfied engine
turning over
Uplift
the village bus
surmounts
the humpback bridge
Forebodings
the cows all pointing one way
weathercockwise
intimations of thunder
in my little toe
Small Hours
the studious anglepoise

off by heart
Romanesque
The Lion of Adultery
comes pouncing down.
His eyes bulge menacingly;
his mane is a blaze
of little slick flame-tufts.
Under his impending paw
a woman stands
whispering, animatedly,
words of love
into an office telephone.
You see a lawn
in Arcadia
or Suburbia.
Dapper, bearded,
two Centaurs lift
nimble forelegs to drum
the earth's taut tum.
With blithe smiles,
they represent
the innocence of the world
on a Bank Holiday Monday.
By the moon and padlock
it must be night
and a dangerous part of town.
One of the Unnamed Martyrs
hurries home
while, out of sight,
three club-clutching bugaboos
lie doggo.
They are King Yobbo
and his frenzied entourage.
A sort of Dandy Dinmont,
head cocked,
sprouts like an orator.
This is the Miracle
(locally attested)
— of the Dog that Spoke.
Out of the blue
he gave utterance
to all manner of mysteries.
The stars, medicine
and Holy Writ
were among the subjects he covered.
And what he said
his mistress jotted down
on the backs of old, torn envelopes.
The story here
remains obscure,
but the man and woman
who stand in the mouth
of the great, gaping fish —
horned and dragonish —
and peer over its teeth
as from a tiny back garden,
seem less afraid
than might have been expected.
Saint Quotidianus,
a taxi-driver in life,
appears with his emblem —
a steering-wheel.
He is flanked by the Angels
who showed him the true path:
one carries a trumpet,
the other a scrip.
Balloonland
In Balloonland
everyone
is given a balloon
the day they are born.
Freshly blown-up
and with the knot tightly done,
a big balloon
is put into their hand.
A few words are spoken
by way of ceremony:
‘This is your balloon,
the balloon of your destiny–
You are its guardian.
Do you understand?’
And it's no use arguing.
Red, blue or green,
yellow, purple or orange,
that's their balloon
and no one else's.
They are the owner.
So as time goes on
they watch their balloon
with increasing anxiety.
Can it be shrinking?
Is it less shiny?
What's that hissing sound?
Did they do something wrong?
Futile questions!
Some balloons
pop the day they are given,
others last aeons
just getting more wizened.
If you're looking for a reason,
goes one of Balloonland's
wisest sayings,
then apply your own pin.
A Perversion
In the Proceedings of the Royal Institute of Anthropophagy 
(last year's Spring number, page 132),
there is a most unusual instance recorded
of a man and woman who conspired to eat each other—
and would have done so, had not the laws of nature prevented it.
I heartily agree with the writer of the article
who denounces the whole affair as a ‘flagrant travesty’,
a ‘perversion of the established rites’ and a ‘half-baked stunt’.
Your Biographer
Inevitably
your biographer
is getting it all wrong.
His little screen
recapitulates
the few known facts.
With rapidly dabbing
fingertips he coaxes
a workable pattern, till
there it is —
the truth at last!
And you stand condemned
to centuries
of ignominy,
your well-polished plea unheard.
Synopsis
The novel I propose to write will be
about the size of a late Henry James,
only more airy and accommodating.
The supple interplay of major themes
will furnish it with the exhilarating
sense of a mind meticulous but free.
To catch the voice of truth itself dilating
on the great problems of reality
will be one of my prime technical aims.
A plot that brings the cogency of dreams
to bear on the profoundest tragedy
is already in outline, pending writing.
Love will be treated somewhere, and I see
two figures, naked, in an intimate setting,
although they have not yet been given names.
I hope to start work soon, but am still waiting
for the advance which will ensure my scheme's
otherwise cast-iron viability.

For Art's Sake
Arbiter
See that man?
You may not know him,
but he carries considerable clout.
Only last week
when he offered his opinion
a reputation tottered.
Art — any art —
is his first love,
and so he prowls the globe
from conference to conference.
There are opera tickets
in his wallet,
a Tiepolo at home.
Be civil to him,
for he is the prince
of a hundred committees
and his fingers loosen bursary-strings.
Klangfarbe
At the first performance
of his twenty-minute sonata
for trombone and lightbulb,
based — so the programme note told us —
on a reading of Jung's
Seelenprobleme der Gegenwart
the most eloquent detail
and the one I shall remember
beyond all those whomps and rasps and splintered high notes
was the ping of the filament.
Cork Street
In his dream
he had finished a painting,
only one,
but the ultimate statement,
n square feet
of existential brushwork,
and there it hung
in its appointed place:
white wall, polished boards,
with a woman at a desk
and the sense offstage
of pinstripes milling,
captious, legal voices
on the phone from New York
and a fat armoured vehicle
impatient at the gate.
A Living Sculpture in the Museum without Walls
For seven years
I tended the shrine,
kept the archives,
swept the floor.
But now she has left me
and the street noise of art history
yammers in my ear.
Howl, Howl
It was a poignant moment:
the old king broken
and that seasoned growl —
the hallmark of so many
memorable commercials —
pitched high and plaintive.
In his arms,
the slack body
of his youngest daughter,
whom I recall
exhibiting her nipples
in some gangland vendetta movie
years back.
The loyal earl
turned his face downstage,
and we knew then
beyond a doubt 
that he had justified
the difficult leap
from sitcom
to the legitimate theatre.
Go, Little Book
A grisly marriage
and a dead-end job;
a misconceived affair
and its botched curtailment;
no adequate solace
from parents or children;
hours spent alone
in the room upstairs
with the neighbours' television
throbbing through the wall…
somehow resulted
in a little clutch
of wryly-turned
and unemphatic lyrics,
which a Northern press
was persuaded to add
to its Autumn list,
and whose only reviewer —
an Oxford post-graduate
on the make
in ‘literary London’—
was able to despatch it
in two brisk sentences,
one containing a joke.
