The procedure is expected to take about 3 hours.
The procedure is expected to be completed within 24 hours from receipt of the form.
Running the Procedure
The steps to be taken to complete this process are as follows:
Fill in the date and time in the spaces labelled{ Date},{Time}respectively on the row labelled{ 1.
Restore Started}{Date Time}on the form NEWOED1 .
Make sure all Oedipus users are logged off.
Logon to user-id OEDDBA .
If the{ From Working Set}box contains ‘A ’ or ‘B ’then select the next available tape from the TEXTA/TEXTB rack.
If the{ From Working Set}box contains ‘J ’ then select the next available tape from the TEXTJ rack.
Load the tape to tape unit number 580 or, if already in use or unavailable, to tape unit 581 .
If both units are in use or unavailable inform the New OED Computer Group representative who will issue further instructions.
When logged on:
Panel ‘BATCH' will appear.
You will be asked to supply a number corresponding to statements on the panel.
This procedure is statement{ 2.
Restore to table of origin}.
Therefore:
Type 2 then press ENTER .
You will be asked to confirm your selection:
Type ‘Y' to continue, or ‘N' to abandon.
NOTE: from this point users will not be able to access Oedipus.
Panel ‘RET01' will appear.

When the transfer has been completed (probably the following morning) you should continue as follows:
Press PF03 to leave menu (this will enable Oedipus users to re-access the system).
Logoff from user-id OEDDBA , by typing ‘LOGOFF' .
The tape should be unloaded and labelled.
The labelling should include the Text Table Number , as displayed on the panel and the days Date .
The tape should be returned to its original position in the rack.
The date and time the process ended should be recorded on the row{ Completed Date Time}, below the{ 1.
Restore}row on the NEWOED1 form.
If necessary you should add any comments regarding the running of the procedure in the space provided on the NEWOED1 form.
The completed NEWOED1 form should be returned to the New OED Computer Group representative making sure a copy is retained.

The procedure should be completed within 48 hours from receipt of the form.
Running the Procedure
This procedure is operated in two parts:
Table Transfer
The steps to be taken to complete this process are as follows:
The date and time the process was started should be recorded on the row labelled{ 2.
Bring Started Date}{Time}in the appropriate places on the form NEWOED1 .
Make sure all Oedipus users are logged off.
Logon to user-id OEDDBA .
Panel ‘BATCH’ will appear.
You will be asked to supply a number corresponding to statements on the screen.
This procedure is the one labelled{ 3.
Bring to Working-Set}on the panel.
Therefore:
Type 3 then press ENTER .
You will be asked to confirm your selection; type ‘Y ’ to continue,‘N' to abandon.
Panel ‘MGET01’ will appear.
You will be prompted to supply the following information:
NOTE: from this point, users will be unable to access the system.
{Text table number?}to which should be entered the number in the box labelled{ From Table Number}.
{Target window?}to which again you supply the information from the box labelled{ To Working-Set}(A, B or J)
Press ENTER .
You are asked to confirm your selection by pressing ENTER again.
When the process has been successfully completed the following message will appear:
{Text table x successfully transferred to window y}
Where x = the text table number that was transferred
y = the target window.
Failure to get this message, or if another message appears, the New OED Computer Group Manager should be informed.
This process should take about 2 hours.
When completed successfully:
Press PF03 to leave the final panel (this will also enable users to access the system again).
Log off from user-id OEDDBA , by typing ‘LOGOFF' .
Archiving
When completed the working set database should be archived by doing the following:
Logon to user-id OPERATOR .
Type ATT 580 SQLWSET 181 .
The following message should appear:
{Tape 580 attach to SQLWSET 181}
If instead the following message appears:
{TAPE 580 already attached to nn}
where nn = another user-id
then do the following:
Type ATT 581 SQLWSET 181 .
If whilst doing process number 3, the following message appears:
{Tape 581 already attached to nn}
where nn = another user-id
then speak immediately to the New OED Computer group Manager.
If the machine becomes successfully attached then do the following:
Type DISC .
Logon to user-id SQLWSET .
Load next sequential NEWOED database archive tape onto either tape unit 580 or 581 depending upon which one was attached above.
Type ARCHIVE and press ENTER .
A message appears which will prompt you for the following information:
{Ready archive output volume.
Reply CUU}
to which you respond by typing 181 then press ENTER .
The tape will then be archiving.
The following message may appear:
{DMSTLB4281 ‘TAP1(181)’ EOV1 LABEL WRITTEN.}

{ARI070A FOR OUTPUT FILE ARIARCH REASON = END OF VOLUME.}
{ARI070A WHEN READY, ENTER: ‘VOLID CCCCCC’ OR ‘READY’.}
This means the tape is full and the next tape has to be used.
To do this you must do the following:
remove the full tape from tape unit
label the tape with the Date , the Table of Origin and the legend ‘Working Set archive' .
The tape should also be marked with ‘1 of x ’, where{ x}represents the final number of tapes used to archive the table.
load the next sequential NEWOED tape
type READY and press ENTER 
Repeat this last process as necessary, labelling the completed tapes appropriately ‘2 of x ’.
When the database has been completely archived the following message will appear:
{Archive completed}
The following should then be invoked:
Type £CP DET 181 and press ENTER .
Type £CP DISC and press ENTER .
Remove the tape from the tape unit.
Label the tape in a similar manner as stated above noting that this is the final tape.
If other tapes were used they should be properly marked with the final number of tapes used.
The New OED Computer Group should be informed immediately upon completion by returning the NEWOED1 form.
The form should be filled in with the completion time and date on the row{ Completed Date Time}below the row labelled{ 2.
Bring Started Date Time}.
If necessary the form should be completed with any appropriate comments.
