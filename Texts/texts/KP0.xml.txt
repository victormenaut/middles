do you think it'd be a good idea if you started doing some revising I went oh yeah I'll have a think about it


and I sort of like walked out the door and went yeah I've  thought about it .
going to me  all my comments on my thing were really good.
Mine weren't bad.
Apart from given you a B yeah on why it's  just hanging in, must try a lot lot harder, gives me a B and then erm  someone gave me a C  someone gave me a C and said  oh yeah  gave me a C yeah
and said coasting.
gave me a C yeah and said improved greatly from the last  showed much better  in his work and really trying hard  and gave me a C.
yeah, I got f I got, my total marks I could've got was fifty eight and I got fifty four and she gave me a C and she said must improve your marks.
And he goes
Bloody hell.
he goes nah there must be something wrong with this she go he goes I can't, I don't think we can complain about that can we?
He's good about that.
He goes, he goes he goes, he goes 
He doesn't just look at the mark.
I think we'll scrap  cos you missed a week I went 
She averaged practically all of my marks  for some unknown reason.
What do you mean?
The total amount of marks possible was two hundred and five and I got a hundred and nineteen or something I don't know and , and  goes yes I had to average five of his marks because he was absent.
Take averages of the classes.
Yeah but how comes for five?
I didn't miss five pieces of work, that's impossible.
Don't complain.
No I just, I just couldn't work out how he averaged five marks.
I only missed two preps.
That is strange.
In fact I only missed one prep.
Then he goes to me Alistair ex extra curricula and he go erm hockey, cross  and rugby and he goes  mm how about a bit of culture?
I go er what do you mean?
He goes  pottery?
He said that Julian   
And I go sorry, and he goes  makes a jolly good Christmas gift and I go  I can't do it 
 
and he goes how about music

And I go   and he goes  no I didn't think so.
You've done it!
Fucking hell mate.
What you on about?
Oh he goes to me, he goes to me  Jimmy what, he goes, cos I, you know all that extra curricula bit yeah?
Yeah.
I put going down to the English Centre and using the computer  
 
quiet period.
Bollocks.
and he goes what are you using the quiet, what are you using the erm computers for in your quiet periods?
I said well I'm not very good on computers and I've got loads of coursework so I thought if I go down there and type out different pieces of work it would get me familiarized with them
Oh you're such a bullshitter .
and he, and he goes, he goes oh that's a very good idea, he goes don't make it  I haven't got  
got a  
and he goes no neither have I 
Yeah it's yours.
he goes and he goes
It's been recording since you lot have been talking.
I don't mind.
I've got nothing to hide.
I don't care either.
Can you turn  
Down?
Down or up?
Down.
I'm not bothered either erm and he goes  he goes, he goes  I haven't got the best handwriting and by the looks of things neither has Mr  it's completely changed from the first three weekly you had.


He goes you haven't got a new R S teacher  have you ?
I went nah.
Er nah!
Nah!
And he goes to me, he goes to me  so have you thought about my, my suggestion of pottery, I went yeah, and I threw it out the window.


Cos it was actually quite safe the way you walked in here.
It's, it's a really safe bloke actually.
You walked in and you goes Melissa and Rupert goes  ooh !and I could see Rupert   and then you go, I go Rupert I go
She scares me that woman.
Spanish and he goes, he knew what I was talking about so all of a sudden he goes  ah so tell me a bit about this erm this Melissa so I said
You're kidding!

So I said erm she's Spanish and he goes ah!
Spanish are nice w nice girls
Oh you git!
so he goes oh if she's at  and he goes ah right, right
Oh you're such a
so I had to make conversation then I said erm so how are the old Colts B doing and he goes er  had a bit of a  junior 
 
You made conversation with him!
junior Colts, sorry junior Colts, and he said erm ah had a bit of a roll at the beginning and then towards the end now we've sort of lost loads in a row so I said, he said alright I said about the same with us  then I was, so I said it's cold and he said mm yes it is rather.
What did he say?
He goes to me, he goes to me  he goes, I don't actually  he goes if there's one good thing about your three weekly Jimmy  there's never any Ds on it   but there's never ever blooming As either why not ?


So I goes, I went
Oh my God!
well sir  tt I think that er I don't think many teachers like marking my work and he goes oh why's that?
I said cos it's not very good
 

and he starts going yes well I think we'd better try and get a few As on there hadn't we and  
I got good end of term report.
He goes Alistair, what is happening?
The two main subjects that are really gonna matter, maths and English, one says you can't stop mucking around
Is that English?
and you ask daft stupid questions
Is er
yeah, and then he goes 
he gave me  poor result.
then maths and he goes but maths  he says you're half asleep all the time, I mean you're not doing any work at all.
So I said well sir I find maths really boring and I walk into this classroom and it's all painted the same with this blackboard in front and I just find it boring, he goes yes  guess who he was taught by at rugby?
Your favourite maths teacher  he was taught by .
Serious?
Bloody hell.
Is he any good at maths?
No I would say he's crap.
I thought he might be.
Oh shut up!
I sat, I'm, I'm sa I'm si I'm sitting there yeah 
 
and he goes he goes well 
most expensive  
oi  oi I'm sitting there yeah and he 
 
and he, I've got all these marks yeah and he goes oh well that's roughly about seventy percent oh that's about sixty that's about fifty and he goes  yes well there's, there's nothing to worry about, there's no great alarm bells ringing  yet.
He said there were warning bells for me.
And he said, he said, he said it's n he said, he goes to me, he looks at it for about five minutes and goes  it'll do, it'll do.


So I went thanks sir and he goes, he goes 
Price per ton.
he goes who else is in your neck of the woods, I went  
It's what he said to me.
I was gonna say Alistair but then I thought he's in the loo so I can't.
Anyway so he goes is James  there and I went yeah and he goes  mm, so I went I think so, I'd better go and get him hadn't I  
But I walk in yeah and he goes  he goes  hold on, now you're Alistair, and I go yeah, and he goes  I think I've just given your three weekly to Jimmy.
And he go I go no I don't think so.

Thanks Jim.
Why do you?
No I don't.
Oh bollocks I can't write that it's  
a bit of the old incest.
That's disgusting,
Just let me have a quick look  
Have you two got the same prep?
Yeah.
We have most things, we have most things the same.
Yeah cos they're all in the same set, cos they're, cos they're bo cos all of them are thick.
And what are you in Jimmy?
I'm in the sets above them.
So he should be in the set below us.
Ah that really hurt that 
I'm in set free for French.
Set free.

Spelt F R E E.


Jimmy you're on a linguistic  
I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in I'm in
are you?


I'm in the same set, I'm in the same set for him as maths.
M A F S .
And history.
And history.
That's alright that one.
What else am I in?
Begun with an H.
Turn up the music a bit.
First of all you tell me to turn it down and then you tell me to turn it up.

Well it is now innit?
What's that?
Linguistics.
Yeah!

No but  wants to know if you get to keep all the tapes cos he want to  them all.
I know.
He's gonna 
He's gonna chief them.
Chief 'em he's gonna chaff 'em all.
He's going to take them without you're knowing.
Mm.
James.
Spastic.
More reactive metals are more abundant in the earth's crust as one can see by looking at the grass.
I can't think what else to write.
Oh hold on.
I've just been doing the wrong question.


I called it question one it's question six, oopsy, seven.
Using the table two, where's that?


Thanks James, here we are.
I've done that.


and try to explain why gold is more expensive than silver.
Gold is the
Well she'd just be calling back about now.

My little friend.
Gold is the least abundant
I need that .
and
Why ?
least reactive
Oh no.
Aluminium is more expensive than iron.
Please could you refrain from using such a  
Aluminium is more expensive than iron 
as it is disrupting my mind patterns.
Yeah?
because it
Oh mate!
is
take it down Hertford.
harder
I'll take it round Simon

and get the
Which is worse  
product out.
copper is more expensive than aluminium.
 

Oi will you give me the question sheet, I need it!
No, wait.
Buy your own.
It is mine!
are not the only factors that affect the price of metals  other factors  might be important.
Is that the last question?
No.
We've got chemistry.
We haven't got chemistry till the afternoon.
I know.
I know.
I don't know why I'm doing it.
easily found 
Right on.
They'll get bust and erm
He'll sit on them.
Well no but if I do bust 'em
Whether or not they are easily found
Can you buy them again?
or easily
What?
ex 
Oh cos I wanna get some headphones cos 
extracted 
earphones just sort of pl go on the outside of your ear whereas the er headphones actually go inside your ears.
It saves battery power that's all.


Cos you
How can you save battery power?
No cos you, you only have to have it on volume three to get the same amount of noise out  instead of volume two.
So if you're playing rave and you have it on volume two  really really  
Easily extracted 
I've gotta get a new pair of headphones 
I don't know, I was listening to one of my headphones, alright I pulled it out
And it broke.
and like a little speaker bit stayed inside my ear and the outer bit came out and  
 
I don't know what happened cos they were alright before.
It is easily obtained.
Have you seen Mark  's erm earphones?
Headphones.
Like in gold, they're sort of I mean they're not real gold, gold plated on the outside.
Question nine.
Imagine a world in which gold and silver were cheap but iron and aluminium were rare, what advantages  would there be making a car from gold instead of iron and saucepans from silver instead of aluminium.
 
Well he's got two Walkmans himself, his mum's got one, his brother's got one.
They're all like really flush gits.
reactive, reactive and
Who?
turn it down, and it's on volume one or something.
This doesn't make sense.
I can't be bothered to do this.


I'm doing question ten tomorrow.
Hit all the lights, let's have some light in this room.
This is such a massive room, there's so many lights.

What am I like?
Dunno.
We are now in the studies   What's this?
  

Oh no, lots of work.
How horrible.
 

Right.
What's going on?
Maths project    on drugs.
Right.
Now the formula
is either a half or minus one times  minus two or  
 
or it's a half N minus one times N minus two over two.
Have you got a pen?
And it's for one of the regions  it's a closed one.
Which regions?
What is it?
Half 
Lines to closed regions?
Are you talking about  regions?
No, half N minus one.
Half brackets N minus one.
Yeah.
Times N minus two 
What are you doing?
And I'm not sure if it's over two or not.
You are a sad bastard .
Thank you.
this?
Leave it.
What's it doing?
Recording what we're saying, linguistics thing for Norway.
Really?
So is it recording me?
yeah.
Yes.
It's recording you personally  
You see this thing did you buy this separately or did it come in the Walkman?
We were lent them.
Lent them?
Yeah.
By who?
Norwegian government.
No b university.
These or the Walkmans as well?
Both.
Does the Walkman have to be a special type?
No  to record that.
But I mean like could you plug that into a normal Walkman?
Don't know.
had a record button.
Yeah you can.
But it has to have a record button?
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's got a record button.
I can see, I can see it's got a record button.
Yeah I just thought I'd point it out to you.
I know you did.
Can we listen to this?
Can we wind it back and listen to it?
No!
No  recorded lots of conversations.
Ru can I borrow some of your erm , just a little bit?
No.

Well no it doesn't matter er 
Anonymity guaranteed.
it doesn't matter  
Anonymity 
 

Pissing hell!
Anona anona 
anonymity 
That's the one.
Yeah.
is guaranteed so it doesn't really matter.
And then just use bits of the tapes.
So they won't use  
I should imagine.
they won't use the bit where we say fuck fuck fuck
Fuck.
she, she's brilliant  so we're gonna ask if she can be, well we've asked, she's coming to our house dinner you know

Yes.
But you could you could bug someone probably like say that was covered up you could talk to them and make, they wouldn't even realize they were being 
Shut up will you.
Sorry I thought that was quite  
 
Could you, could you plug this into like a dictaphone?
Yeah.
Yeah as long as it's got a recording  
Well of course dictaphones have always got records on them, that's why they're called dictaphones.
Oh sorry.
Yeah cos you dictate into them.
Oh be quiet!
Oh be quiet  and will it pick it up as well if you do that?
If I do that.
Yes it can pick it up.
Yeah it picks everything up.
Look.

Look.
Look that's how much battery power I've got left.
You've got loads basically.
Yeah.
He's got four packets of batteries.
And about ten tapes.
Hang on a minute.

What all supplied by the Norwegian government?
Have you seen the tapes?
Have you seen these tapes?
Well of course I have.
Brilliant tapes.
Shit!
C D recording type.
What and they're all supplied by the Norwegian government?
streamlined as well

The lady came here on, on, when was it?
Thursday 
Well what, what how come, why, well who did she talk to?
Anyone in
No it was offered, it was offered around and me and  said yeah we'd do it.
 
It's a linguistic thing to find out how upper class exclusive  
We're, we're known as upper class teenagers.
Oh, oh we're upper class school children are we now?
Oh that's fantastic !
 
No you're not.


You can try.
That's exactly what he sounds like when it's played back.
What?
When I talk on it.
When I talk on it .
He listens, he listens to it afterwards and he goes  no I can't understand, well  now I can, now I can understand why they take the piss out of me for my voice .


Oh shut up.
Don't, it's so sensitive I promise.




Look the recording level is 
Yeah so, so then who did she offer it round to?
Charlie ch ch Mr  came and said, Charlie, came and said erm
Charlie ?
Yeah 
Yeah the bald one.
The, what the bald, fat coot?
Came and said okay who wants to do this and me and  
 
said yeah we'd do it.
The little cunt who made me parade in front of him at eight thirty in the morning so I erm
That's the one.
Pardon me.
We'll probably, you'll probably have someone like Mr  listening to this tape.
Good, fuck off Mr 


No  just take, just take them back.
oh it was brilliant.
ah he was so class, he was brilliant.
He's so  
He's, he's he's so much better than Mr 
Shit that's good.
Can we listen back to it please, can we just listen to it and we'll go back to the same place?
can't cos I have to take it out and
Oh just quick!
No cos I have to plug in earphones.
No you don't.
Yes I do.
Can't you plug it into the stereo?
No.
Yeah but I just don't want to have to take it out 
What the fuck's this?
Just leave, Ben just leave it.
marked on the  
Is this so you can make  do they let you keep the stuff at the end?
Oh right on!
 

That'd be quite good.
Don't cos I swear when it, I did that and it sounds  deafening cos th look how high the recording level is.
But it's always that high even when I'm speaking now it's going that high.
No but recording level here is on ten, I'm not sure  I'll turn it down.


Right it's low.
oh it is.
You could put it like, like that couldn't you?
No cos I don't like you.
How long have you got it for?
Till Friday.
Till Friday, is that all?
Mm.
This Friday?
Next week.
Next week.
When did you get it?
Thursday.

How many tapes did she give you?
Ten.
Do you have to give them all back?
