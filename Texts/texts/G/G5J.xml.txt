Oh good.
Yes.
Well you can  
I've got a wee boy at the scouts and he should be in about half past eight.
As long as I'm not  I said, Are you sure it's not going to be too late, cos I'll be forty five minutes.
He said, No that's quite alright.
So
Oh good, that's good.
How many have you still to get.
I've still got plen Well er that will be two boys, a lady giver, cos you have to find people who give stamps as well as.
Oh yes.
Now that's quite difficult I would think.
And a male collector.
So that's me got four and I've got another five to do and I had a telephone call from field controller in Edinburgh last night and I really do think I don't know how I managed to keep my tongue still.
Comments like, I suggest instead of wasting time on leads, I suggest you try knocking on doors.
That is the only way you will find them.
I said, Well Anne Avril and I knocked on eighty five doors on Thursday evening before we got one contact.
I said i can go out and walk the streets for hours and find no one.
Right.
I says, I have to follow up leads.
Yes but I'm not interested in you following up leads, I'm interested in nine interviews.
I said, Well I think it'll be a miracle if I get nine interviews because the quota is far too tight.
I don't understand what you mean by tight.
I says, Well  right
The area's not
Right away I said, I have three people to find for working class areas who collect stamps, who are interested in stamps.
I said, People generally have more to do with their money.
And of course what defeated me was  knows this fellow that  is an ambulance driver and he's classed as working class.
And he stays in a four-bedroomed detached house.
But his wife's a school teacher and that's why.
Yes well .
So you're not going to get that  like I mean that that was a one in a million shot, finding 
Yes.
him.

I dictate a lot of letters to a lot of people.
Tomorrow I will sign ultimately twenty odd Do they want me to sit 
Aye I think they must it must be talking about dictating as well.
down and sit writing long hand?
No.
No I think they'll mean it's number of stamps .
Cos I rarely ever do that.
I think it's they look for the number of stamps used rather if it's what you
Ah well good.
Aha.
Okay.
I would say that.
Even though you don't physically write them.
Even dictating them I think you should count that as writing.
Do you count that?
I think so though .
Oh.
Oh well.
I think so.
Right  
If you want to change 
 
it you just put a stroke through it.
Just put a stroke through that one.
And circle the one you you want to circle.
So I agree strongly yes.

Well that's quite essential cos you you should know what's  
 
Oh I see right, fair enough.
I was raging.
papers a lot.
Aye I had to look through the whole lot of them.
And get back to the designs and see what could be improved upon and what have you.
Then that very night I got a phone call from this woman.
This dietician saying that the architect w wants to know all about endoscop what it involves, so that it gives him an idea as to what is  about.
So I thought, What are you asking me for?
I said, If the architect wants to know, he can come and look and see for himself.
I says, I only work part time you know.
She said, Oh I take it  you don't know anything about this.
I said, No, how should I?
She said, Dr  was supposed to speak to you about it.
I said, Well he's never mentioned it.
Mm.
I said,
Well you should have high regard  asking for yours.
Well it's just  the architect She said, Well it doesn't matter, if he hasn't said to you.
Well I said she said,surprised.
I said, Oh, I'm not surprised,.
.
.
I felt like saying, I've got a bloody big pile of rubbish here that I have to go over so I've put in for  overtime.
Why not.
I apologi I was raging.
I thought, Right this could take seconds.
Mhm.
If I just knew where he was prepared to stand and then could just sort of do the things round about.
Mhm.
So I paged him.
And he 
How big how big is the room?
Oh it's big.
Mm.
Well biggish.
It's about that width from there
Aha.
to there and oh  square sort of to here, like a four 
Mm.
bedded bay.
Oh there's four beds in it?
I only know about the room.
There would have been, it's a ward.
At the moment they're redesigning 
Oh I see aha.

So of course we were there, the geriatrics in there  
Infectious disease ward?
Aye well it's over in that unit.
Mhm.

Over where?
I said, Oh guess where.
I said, I'm on  ward one or two, I don't know which one it is.
So you you  
So I said, are you coming over, I said, this could take minutes if I knew where exactly
So
you were going to stand.
Now
In casualty  day unit is to open It's all to be opened up, they're building a new day unit and whether the day unit has access 
Why are they doing this?

Mhm.
Och I don't know.
I don't know what's going on in the hospital.
I don't bother to find out.
So he didn't come over.
No I'm not coming over.
He said, Just think of the place as four walls.
Bare walls.
I said, There's bloody windows, the whole length of one wall.
Mhm.
Just
So  
forget about the windows.
Forget No forget about the windows.
You can't forget about the windows..
Oh aye, they can be bricked up.

Oh no, they'll I suggested they leave the window ledge and just left sort of a window that deep along
Mhm.

Mhm.
Anyway.
I  was raging.
Well I'm not coming over.
Just like that.
I thought, you cheeky piggy.
I said, Oh well, right.

So I get the back of something and I scribbled, Cupboards here, cupboards here, cupboards here, cupboards here and I thought, Right I'll see  off duty.
I was supposed to be off at four, this was six so I thought,two hours overtime.
Right, quite right cos you have to work for two  
So that was that.
So I got home .
Aha.
Aha.
Now i if his computer er had been up and running, erm you know I might be able to  design something.
Anyway so and then of course Oh that was another thing, I said to him, No you'll want to sit somewhere you'll want I don't want a desk in there, I'm not having my desk in there.
I said, Oh yes, and if you think for one minute I'm taking  pathology forms to your room, I said, you must have had .

Is it far away?
Hey?

Mm.
And there are about ten .

I .
Oh no is it a golf club possibly.
 
Er before you get to  hotels.
in the bottom out the bottom  
Aha.
the other end I think they go  and round to the right .
I thought it was on the right hand side as you went into  village.
Obviously it's not.

Could be  wrong .
The food is supposed to be good.
So that's always something.
Mm.
East Kilbride has a lovely golf course.
Nice golf house..

One day we were up at Dunfermline.
Oh right.

Pulled a muscle or something.
And I could only play nine holes and I had to

So I don't know.
I took two  and  on Tuesday and it's been fine since so God knows what's gone wrong.

So of course she didn't like to say.
We're two thirds of the way along I thought, Sheila, I said, I'm heading for the wrong bridge.
I'm heading for the Forth road instead of the  bridge.
I said, Well I'm not  
I mean .
didn't know where we were going.
Mhm.
Er cos it's not actually Dunfermline, the golf club it's at er .
. You know where  is.
It's three miles out of Dunfermline as you leave the town and go towards  Bridge.
Anyway it took us an hour and twenty minutes to get there, it took us forty minutes to get home.
That's the difference.
Er it's much much longer going  Bridge.
Er What was I going to say?
No.
