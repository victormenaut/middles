Right just  
Right, first thing,
We'll make a list.
I lost me prescription when he gave me, and we've been away.
The, my eye I got some drops from the chemist cos my eye was bad.
And it feels as if there's grit all in it now.
Yeah.
So you hav t haven't actually had any  Eyecron 
No I had, I had  of the chemist in Chapel because it came 
Yeah.
so bad.
Yeah.
So you really need 
 
some  Eyecron don't you?
Yeah.
I think I do with this.
You really need some  Eyecron 
Yeah.
I wouldn't go to a doctor there because of this malignant thing so I just managed till we came back  
Yeah , well I 
Getting better but it's just this gritty thing in the back of my eye, I mean I 
Yeah.
was
Just er look up for me.
It still looks rather boggy doesn't it?
Mm.
It's terrible.
Er  the other eye.
That one 
Mm.
doesn't look too bad but that one  
 
Just look straight at me.
Yeah I, the front of the eye looks quite,
Mm.
It just feels horrible.
Yeah.
It's nothing to do with hay fever is it, this, do you think?
Yeah.
Cos when I blow nose, this thing,pops.
It's ever so queer.
There's a drainage tube,th 
I've always suffered with my sinuses.
there's a drainage tube that goes from 
Yeah.
this corner of the eye, to 
Yeah.
the top of the nose.
Which is 
Mm.
why, when you cry, your nose runs.
Okay, and 
Mm.
Mm.
if that is a little, that keeps blocking,
Mm.
when you blow your nose it will tend, it can go the 
Mm.
other way as well.
Yeah.
But are they okay with leaving it 
 
for another week will I?
It'll be okay with 
Mm.
leaving it.
I hope.
Well I hope the  Eyecron will actually get it to settle down.
So, you said that was the first thing, or were, was it  that were both  it 
No that was it.
I wanted to be honest and say I'd 
Yeah.
lost a prescription.
Then we 
 
went away you see?
And I thought, well I'll just pop in chemist and I was hoping it would clear it up, so I wouldn't 
Yeah.
have to confess.
No don't wor 
But it's not.
Still gritty?
Yeah.
So we'll see what the  Eyecron does.
If it still remains uncomfortable, then we, then we need to have a closer look and we may need to get the eye specialist involved if it's refused to settle down.
But you can still see clearly?
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's good yeah.
I  a lot of pain at the back of my eye though
Yeah.
while I were on 
 
holiday, it was terrible.
Well it's bit brighter at the coast, and
Yeah.
Well we'll, we'll see what happens with the  Eyecron I think that'll turn it off, but  doesn't then we must have another look, very 
 
important.
I'm very  Bye bye.
Okay.
See you.
Bye now.
