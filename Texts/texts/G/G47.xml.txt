Hello.
pinching .
Erm, it's about my back today.
Aha.
It's  for a, a couple of weeks there it wasn't too bad, but now I feel as if it's .
What did you do to it?
It doesn't look bruised, mind, but it feels, sore to touch or anything?
I, I really don't know what I've done.
I know times I get it, like  maybe just at one side, if I've been sitting in a hard seat
Mhm.
at a, a particular wee bit if I've been leaning back,
Aye.
you know, but 
But this is all over?
Right.
It's just i i there isn't any bruising.
And there's nothing to see?
You know, I've I've, well I've looked.
The best I can
Mhm.
and I cannae see any bruising, but  it feels
It feels all bruised.
as though it's all bruised.
And in 
And no and nothing you can think of that started it up?
and it's sore like  nerves.
Like
Pins and needles?
you know how if you hit your elbow?
Aha right.
Or er  you know into my finger.
Into your fingers.
You know when I, when I go to lift something, or if I use
Mhm.
pressing on this finger,
Aye, it feels numb.
right up
Right up the arm.
Right.
this arm.
Right.
Er your hand doesn't get swollen or anything like that Cathy, no?
You've not seen anything?
No, I don't think it's been
Nothing at all.
swollen or anything.
Right.
right in into my wrist.
Right through?
Right.
Aye.
What about your elbow?
Aye, up to my elbow.
U u right up to your elbow.
Not so bad at the top.
Mhm.
More down at the bottom.
Painful down 
Right.
from my finger up.
Now,are you on anything in the way of tablets that could be upsetting your, your system  at all?
I just got two  two bottles the last time I was in, I can't .
Nothing?
And was one of them not for that and my neck?
Mhm.
That's
Yeah.
still a bit sore.
Still a bit sore?
Right.
Mhm.
Right.
And an odd time 
 
it goes really
Right.
I feel as if it's really deep,
Mhm.
deep, deep.
And then it kind of calms down a wee bit.
Then it calms down, right.
There's nothing in that that would cause this problem.
Is this a sort of neuralgia 
just 
Yeah.
you know a kind of painkiller I'm taking.
No , it's  er, no this tingling down to your fingers, that's a different thing Catherine.
Erm, right.
Is it the same thing?
Aye, it's the same thing down your back.
Yeah.
Coming down my back maybe, and 
Now the one thing you'll have to watch  excuse me  excuse me, with these tablets, is anything with alcohol in it.
It's liable to make you sick
Mhm.
if you mix the two.
And
I've been feeling a wee bit sick.
Yeah.
Apart from just this.
That's right.
Like, well, the wee'un's not too good, she's loaded with the cold and  sore throat, and been a wee bit sick, too.
But today 
Yeah.
I've been feeling a wee bit
Yeah.
I had something to eat earlier on, and I felt awfully 
Just
sicky.
as if I was going to be sick.
watch your  watch your tummy with this  stuff.
It's good, but it's  you know, it'll fight  er with anything, any sort of beer or whisky or any of these things, but it'll also fight with cough bottles.
Er and tonic bottles.
Because nearly all of them have a very small amount in.
So, if you're on anything like that at all, forget it.
Leave it off just now Cathy.
And what about the
till I get you sorted.
 Tagamet and things?
Is that o okay?
That's okay.
 Tagamet's fine.
No problem there.
The inhalers?
Ventolin isn't a problem.
Aye, it's only alcohol and things with alcohol in, that you n need to watch Cathy.
And can you give me 
Okay? and that 
some  Tagamet and Ventolin?
Mhm.
There we are now.
And that'll put that right for you.
There you are Cathy.
Could you give me a, a line?
 
.
Er, I had a, a card to go for an X-ray.
For the 
Yes.
pain I was having in my side.
Yes.
But I haven't managed to do it yet.
That's okay.
That's no problem.
Erm  should I, should I wait till the pain's 
First, first time you get a chance.
really really bad or anything before I go?
No?
Just any time?
No no.
No no.
Just first time you get a chance, you go over and get them to X-ray it, and they'll see if there's any damage at the back there.
To try and find out what's going on.
Turn you into a human being.


You're not kidding .


That's what it feels like  
Well 
especially with the wee one being
well,
ill, I mean 
well 
she's up all night,.
Turn you int turn you into a human being.
You cannae be upset with her, because she hasn't .
She can't help it.
She can't
Aye well, you look after her, that's the main thing.
Keep her right.
Mm.
Turn her into a human being.
And then she can do  me.
That's right.
Right, Catherine.
Okay now.
Cheerio just now.
