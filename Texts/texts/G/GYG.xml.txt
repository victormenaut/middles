Mr , do have a seat.
What can I do for you this morning?
Well I  seem to have a sore throat I can't get rid of.
I've had it 
 
three week, I've got bad breath and it's all like coming down here and in my ear.
But the thing that concerned me, my little lad's had tonsillitis three times on the trot.
And I'm 
 
wondering whether it's I'm giving it to him, to him or what.
I don't know whether I am or not.
Is he giving it to you, or are you giving it him.
I don't know but he can't shake it off.
He's had antibiotics right, three times, and he's still got it.
Have a quick look at your right ear, your left one looks fine.
What job do you do?
Er well I'm, I'm not working at the moment, cos I've hurt my back.
Oh right.
I've got arthritis of hips and  
You haven't been down drains or anything like that of late?
No.
No.
Stick your tongue out.
Say ah.
Ah.
Still can't see much.
You smoke?
No.
Any false teeth?
No.
right.
Open  mouth for me.
Say ah.
Ah.
Yes, very nasty looking.
Okay, let's have a quick look around the rest of your mouth.
Would you breathe out for me.
Yeah.
Breath is fine.
It's usually in the morning when it's really
Yeah.
really s I've been to dental hygiene cos I thought 
Yeah.
it were my teeth, but she says 
No.
you've got no problem there.
No, I suspect what's happening is the, the stuff that's oozing out of your tonsils is what you're tasting, and 
Yeah.
is what is making the horrible taste.
So your breath is fine, your teeth are fine, your gums are fine, your tongue's fine, but your tonsils look very unhealthy, they really do look nasty.
And you can see little beads of pus oozing out.
I think you've got a really nasty infection down there.
Yeah.
Okay.
coming under 
Yeah.
the armpit.
You know 
Yeah.
and round 
Yeah.
here, I don't whether  
Yeah.
any?
Yeah, the inflammation will often spread down here and make you feel grotty.
Yeah.
Now you rea fo w with a story like this you really need a erm a, a decent does of antibiotics and given the  of the unpleasant taste and the pus you can see, ordinary penicillin probably won't do the trick, so we need to use something with a bit more oomph
Yeah.
than that.
And that's what I suggest we do.
You're not allergic to anything you know of are you?
No.
Okay.
Do you pay for your prescriptions?
Yeah.
Right.
And antiseptic mouthwash of some sort might be a good idea.
Well I've been using that what you buy from
Oh good, yeah.
Keep going, keep going, gargle.
chemist and I've also had a throat spray.
Yeah.
Gargling will help, just to sort of clean out any gunge that's accumulating.
That's it, that's the reason for using it.
You won't actually make the tonsils better any quicker, but it will help to prevent some of the taste and the gunge.
Yeah.
This is a penicillin antibiotic.
It's been sort of turbo charged
Yeah.
by something extra with it.
Th one three times a day, for seven days.
You can take it with food, after food, between meals, makes no odds.
Y you can take 
Yeah.
paracetamol, if you're getting hot and achy.
Yeah.
You can erm yeah.
You can still drink alcohol if you want to, it doesn't interfere with anything, okay.
Yeah.
The side effects of penicillin, the commonest one is loose motion.
So if your bowels go a bit loose, don't be 
Yeah.
too concerned.
But I'd very surprised if that doesn't do the trick.
If it's not settling, then we should do some blood tests and a throat swab, but it's bit late to do those today I'm afraid.
Yeah.
Okay?
Yeah.
And hopefully that'll do the trick.
And if your son isn't settling down then we may need to have another look at him, and run some tests on him.
doctor and he's still with my wife you see.
Oh I see well
sending him to a throat specialist because 
Yeah.
he's had it
Oh.
I see.
like a month now he's had it.
Yeah, that's a long time.
It implies there's something more to it, more to it than just a standard bug I must say.
And if I come down with a sore throat now, I'll know who to blame.
Yeah .
I've got a, a spot here.
Yeah.
I've, I've got to ask you to have a look at it,
Yeah.
my wife says she's seen a programme on telly.
I don't think it's owt anyway, but 
Yeah.
I'll show you anyway.
Yeah
It's just there look I've had it


about three years and it has bled a couple of times.
Mm, that looks like an innocent little er
I don't think it's owt but just to prevent my  
I don't know how you'd describe that but it's er it's got all the features of an innocent little blob.
Right.
I'm okay then.
Yeah, I think that's okay.
Thank you.
Right, not at all.
Take care of yourself.
Yeah,
See you bye now.
Bye.
Hello.
Hel hello Dorothy.
