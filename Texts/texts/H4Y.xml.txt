This, this coming down here, that's the big nerve 
Right .
at the bottom of the back
Yeah.
and down into the top of the leg.
Aha.
And  a wee bit .
And why it comes round here.
And I thought, oh, I wonder what this is?
It's the same with this one here.
It comes right down your arm,
 
right down to the tips of your fingers.

It's like a toothache.
So it is and it goes .
It's right inside the nerve.
Isn't that  ?
That's wh that's why it's so sore.
Oh.

Aye or anything,
Powers up, powers down, bed.

No.
No.
No.
M 
better
You get folk in their, in their thirties and forties with this  
With the same thing?
Aye.
It's, it just er I'm not sure what happens, I, I think what happens is that the, the circulation into the nerve
Aha.
gets blocked somehow.
Oh.
Aha.
And you're not getting the proper circulation down through 
So .
the nerve, so it's sending the wrong messages back up.
I didn't know that .
Aye.
And you, you're getting this
And you're getting the pain.
And it feels absolutely terrible, especially in the cold mornings.
That's right.
If you go outside in the cold mornings
Aha.
and it feels all as if it's numb?
It does.
Aye.
Mhm.
And it, it's just right up my shoulder here .
Just  here.
That's 
And 
right.
and there and right down 
And right down to my fingers.
right down.
Mhm.
With one, one man said I used to put, in the cold mornings I used to put my other hand at the bottom to see if I could get heat, but he couldn't touch his fingers because they were so tender.
Aye this was frozen to me,
That's right.
this hand, you know?
And he just wanted to get the heat in so he kept his other hand round about it.
I couldn't ,
So it's I mean it's not, it's not just yourself.
But it is 
Aha.
a painful thing.
Oh, it is painful right enough.
Now I've given you some good tablets for this
Yeah.
to help to unblock the circulation and to kill the pain.
Aha.
Now they are, because there're two things in them, they're quite strong.
Never take them on an empty stomach.
No, even  with my breakfast.
Mm.
Cup of tea, with 
Yes.
a bit of toast.
Yes.
