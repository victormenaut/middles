Maybe just give him something so  it's so cold as well

No and it is 
Saturday!
No Saturday!
He was coughing so much
Saturday.
He was coughing so much that he made himself sick.
Whooping cough was it?
but I put him on some medicine I got from the chemist and it seems to have calmed it down but his nose is more er hot and cold
No!
Oliver.
so er I've got to keep him off school today and see how he goes over the next day or two.
If he's going to be miserable I mean it's only nursery it doesn't really matter.
Oh no!
Well I phoned them up and you know they  I only have to say it's Mrs  and they say oh!
Ben's Mum.


I said yeah he's coughing 
Well if he's coughing as well and he might make himself sick.
Well this is my fear because I think oh God 
Yeah but I mean it's not fair on him and it's not fair on the teachers because they have to keep rushing around wiping his nose and everything 
It's not yeah yeah yeah it isn't fair so er I thought right you know, I'll keep him home.
Oliver said he wanted to go to nursery today because I got some yellow cards you know they're Daffy Duck
Oh yeah!
from Marks and Spencer you know  different shapes.

He must have about ten.
And I said to him on the weekend.

And I say over a year now  difficulty.
No!
Ben's having a little sleep darling.
On Wednesday.
He's not very well at the moment.

That's nice.
Saturday they're coming round to dinner.
So  I had to  go and get a card and you know bits and pieces.
Yeah 
So went out and I was feeling really tired but I thought well I just been getting up very early in the mornings so 
Yeah 
you know.
Yeah.
When we came back absolutely exhausted.
Like sitting in a chair and drinking a cup of tea.
I just can't do anything else.
And Bill came home really early
Mm
so we had to sit down for a while.
So I decided to do that and started to feel so sick.
Oh no!
I was really nauseous and everything.
Yeah.
And er then by the time they actually came I just felt awful.
Oh no.
And I thought I daren't let on cos it's you know
Ah there's nothing worse 
And er they had they brought a bottle of champagne down 
Oh my god.
My Dad was pouring it out and we were giving Mum the presents and stuff.
In a minute.

And er well after a while I had to  rush upstairs.
Ooh!
So Mum said you all right?
Must've come back looking like a ghost 
Oh no!
you want us to go.
Oh no!just talking and stuff tends to take your mind off.
You feel better now?
Yeah.
And I didn't have anything to eat Saturday at all.
And then yesterday Bill went to work again and luckily he was home by lunchtime.
Mm.
We got up about nine so it wasn't too bad.
Bill came home about half past one.
And he still wanted to go and have a sleep.
And I went to bed.
Which is not like me!
And I got up at er five o'clock.
I started to feel better and Bill was doing the garden.
Then Phil came round.
Mm.
And er I started to feel a bit better and suddenly I felt ill again.
Oh no!
Really sort of you know
Yeah.
just achey.
And my head was just pounding!
Mm.
Well I thought it was going to explode!

Because Phil was here Bill was
They didn't have you up?
No!
No!
No!
I was up at about ten I suppose.
No about half past nine.
And er because Phil was here Oliver went to bed about ten so he woke up about ten  And I've swallowed a couple of pills and feel fine.
I think I'm the same.
Really odd.
You know this weather is I think confuses us  it's really odd.
You know I just felt 
 
I  simply odd  awful sick.
I just felt really run down.
Ill you know?
Mm.
And er let's hope little one doesn't  
 
Yeah why I sort of kept away from him.
And I didn't eat anything.
I wasn't hungry.
Well the thing is if you have got a tummy virus like that you're best bet is not eat anything 
No!
Well I didn't want anything to eat.
No.
But  yesterday I really fancied something sweet.
Lucky I had some biscuits in  So whether it was er because my period started on Friday
Mm.
So Mum said you know could it be my  blood sugar level.
Yeah!
It could be right down.
That can happen.
Yeah.
She made me  
That looks like a Mars Bar you got don't they?
Yeah that's right.
We had noticed the week before that er that we had some Penguin biscuits in and er really sort of we kept looking at these Penguins
And you left that one  
Yeah I know and he started munching it and he's made it all soggy.
But er I kept looking at them on Friday.
I finally succumbed.
I think it was you waving the temptation under my nose.
And I did I had one today.
But I think that's got a lot to do with it.
Mm.
Because it seems something you're not used to eating
Yeah.
No.
It's nice isn't it?
Oh it's only the school 
It's lovely.

Or some children have and some children don't.
With Oliver it's his ears.

Next time you cook it can you leave out the leeks?
It was nice but I didn't like the
I always use to put onions in it always.
Up to 
Six months.
But I
Six months?
Yes but I decided I didn't like it  so I didn't put in any.
But when I didn't put any you said why can't we have it with the onions any more and I said you said it gave you indigestion.
Hm 
In future you decide exactly what you want to eat and you tell me what you want in it.
I'm not moaning.
You are moaning.
I'm not.
and its getting on my nerves.
I'm not.
I just asked why there's onions in it.
Because I always used to toss it in
So you just changed your mind and put it in.
I just decided to put it in to see if it tastes better .
If it's a problem throw it all away.
I'm sick to death of it.
and I put pasta in and it was nice except 
I just asked a question.
Don't carry on.

Oh yeah it was nice but I'd rather not have that in it.
Why have we got that and that?

It's not Willie it's all the time every week you say something about something.
You tell me what you'd like to eat exactly in future and if I feel like doing it I'll do it.
And if I don't feel like doing it you can do something yourself.
Ah.
Don't  It's our anniversary 
Can you read this one?
Which one?
Dummy.
Which one's that?
Ah Paddington Bear.
Paddington Bear at Christmas time.
And it's got lots and lots of letters.
It has.
Well would you like me to get you some breakfast first?
Erm nice drink.
A nice drink.
Mm mm
Well read this one then Mummy will get you some breakfast.
Okay.
What's this one called Paddington's Magical Christmas.
Mm
One day not long before Christmas Paddington was busy doing his accounts when he heard Mrs Bird singing which was most unusual.
As he listened to the words he nearly fell off his chair with surprise.
It seemed her true love had sent her a present from a partridge in a pear tree.
As it happened Paddington was having trouble about what to buy the Brown family for Christmas and he wished he'd thought of it himself.
Which 
We'll find out in a moment.
He hurried out into the garden but to his disappointment he couldn't see a pear tree anywhere let alone one with a partridge in it.
He gazed hopefully at Mr Brown's apple tree.
But apart from a few sparrows and a robin redbreast  the branches were bare.
Paddington made his way back in doors.
And no sooner was he inside when he heard Mrs Brown singing that her true love had sent four calling birds three french hens two turtle doves not to mention another partridge in a pear tree.
Hm
Paddington could hardly believe his ears and he hurried back outside as fast as he could go but once again he was too late.
Even the sparrows and the robin redbreast had flown away and all that was left was one fat old pigeon sitting in the lawn.
All the same Paddington decided to keep his eyes and ears open.
Clearly there was something going on.
Sure enough no sooner had he settled down it was Judy's time to break into song.
This time she announced it wasn't Mrs Brown's four calling birds three French hens two turtle doves and a partridge in a pear tree she had been five gold rings.
Paddington decided that Browns must have a very rich friend indeed if he could afford so many presents.
It made his list look very small.
He couldn't afford much more than a set of plastic rings let alone five gold ones.
Over the next few days the mystery deepened.
Seven swans swimming arrived and disappeared  again before Paddington had a chance to see them.
He even tried looking in the oven but Mrs Bird drove him out of her kitchen with her feather duster.
Eight maids a milking came and went
Where's he gone?
But Paddington did find a note on the door step asking for two extra pints and things.
Where's he gone Mummy?
Hm table tennis.
He began to wonder if he aught to ring for the police but no one else seemed to be in the slightest bit worried.
When Paddington heard what Mrs Bird sang next.
Nine ladies dancing he decided perhaps that she had ordered the extra milk in case they got thirsty.
He searched the house from top to bottom.
There was no sign of any body.
Just as he was about to come downstairs he heard Jonathan singing.
It seemed he had been sent no less than ten lords a leaping.
Paddington decided to go see his friend Mr Grover who kept an antique shop in Portabello Road.
Apart from all the antiques Mr Grover also had piles of books about every subject under the sun and Paddington felt sure he would be able to explain the mystery.
As soon as Paddington arrived Mr Grover made some cocoa and they settled down on the horse hair sofa at the back of the shop.
Tell me Mr Brown he said what is the problem.
I can see that you are very worried about something.
Mrs Bird has fallen in love with a very rich man who has lots of servants and keeps birds said Paddington.
He sent all sorts of Christmas presents but as fast as they arrive they disappear.
Mr Grover listened carefully as Paddington told him the story.
I think Mr Brown he said at last if you go back to number thirty two Windsor Gardens you'll probably find that he has sent eleven  as well.
Paddington gazed at Mr Grover in astonishment.
He was used to his friends knowing the answers to his problems but this was the fastest ever.
He finished his cocoa as quickly as possible and he was about to leave when  to his surprise Mr Grover began pulling the blind down over his shop door.
You see Mr Brown he explained they haven't really been getting presents.
They've all been joining in singing a Christmas carol but you have given me an idea for your present but you'll have to hurry though -it's Christmas Eve.
A lot of the shops will be closing early.
Paddington trying to keep up with him Mr Grover lead the way along Portabello Road
Who's that Mummy?
That's Mr Grover.
And as they weaved their way from the stores lining the streets he explained what he had in mind.
Paddington grew more and more excited as he listened.
I don' think I shall sleep very much tonight Mr Grover he said.
Just leave it to me said Mr Grover I think between us and with the help of some of our friends in the market we shall be able to give everybody a Christmas to remember.
Mr Grover was as good as his word and on Christmas morning soon after breakfast a very strange procession began making its way from the market.
Where's which's Mr Grover?
We'll find him in a moment.
Towards number thirty two Windsor Gardens.
On the twelfth day of Christmas my true love sent to me twelve drummers drumming eleven pipers piping ten lords a leaping nine ladies dancing eight maids a milking seven swans a swimming six geese are laying five gold rings four calling birds three french hens two turtle dove and a partridge in a pear tree.
If you ask me said Mrs Bird as she invited every one in for a hot mince pies fresh from the oven that's the nicest start to a Christmas day any one can possibly wish for but then she added and with general agreement with a bear like Paddington about the house life is always full of surprises.
Hm.

Are you gonna have a major pig out on biscuits, or are you gonna wait and have your dinner?
Or just eat biscuits and have no dinner?
No.
I'd sooner have dinner.
We've got this.
What d'you want with it?
Salad or  or potatoes and peas.
Umm.
I might have some salad.
D'you want it now?
Mm.
Please.
Joe le Taxi!.
I phoned up some more umm schools.
Uhuh.
Got an appointment to see one of them.
Have you?
Umm, on the eighteenth of June.
What one?
Mead.
Mead Road.
Which is actually in Chislehurst, I think it's up near The Bull somewhere.
You know the big Young's pub.
Oh yeah.
I think it's up there somewhere I'll have to look on the map.
Is it a private?
No.
It's a state school?
Mhm.
Well I don't know yet whether were going to be able to afford it or not do we?
So we have got his name down at a few schools
Just in case.
and then if we can afford to send him privately we can just take his name off.
Yeah.
Just don't send him but if we can't afford it then, we just don't know what's gonna happen do we?
No.
But at least then we're gonna be ready aren't we if we put his name down at four or five schools in the area.
If we get two or three places then we can choose the best one.
Mm.
Then, that's it, it's done.
You know it's sorted out.
Yeah.
And if we can afford to send him to  Bishop Challener or wherever then  I mean if we can't, thing is at Bishop Challener we wanted to ge- reserve a place now and just pay fifty pounds.
If we don't send him we don't get it back.
And what we could do is keep him at Saint Christopher's if we can afford to send him privately, keep him at Saint Christopher's for a couple of years.
Then get him into Bishop Challener as soon as they've got a place.
Mm.
But if we can't then we take him out of Saint Christopher's next year and put him in a state school.
It all, just all depends and a year's a long time isn't it?
Just wait and see what happens, you don't know, it all depends on you doesn't it .
If you go away then as soon as you know that you're going we'll send off registration for Bishop Challener and that's it and we can send off a year's  a year's umm fees in advance can't we?
Yeah.
No problem.
The best thing to do would be to put away five years' worth of umm fees in a high interest building society account and just have a direct debit taken out every term  and the fees to go out wouldn't it.
Cos if we put sort of ten thousand away the interest would be paying for the fees all the time wouldn't it?
Eh?
Yeah.
That would be the best thing.
It would be just done and done with then and there would be no question of not being able to afford it would there?
Just wait and see what happens.
I'm just gonna ring up  cos mum couldn't get through yesterday so she's given me her credit card number to order things.
One of the schools that phoned up, Scotts Avenue or Scotts Park wear a really nice uniform, saw a little girl when I was out today.
Did you?
Red and white check dress she had on and a big red sweatshirt with Scotts Park on the front.
Oh you told me yesterday, yeah.
See another one out there today.
Red blazer she had on.
Didn't see any boys.
Probably grey and red or navy and red.
It's nice having a sweatshirt .
Mhm.
D'you want a smoke?
Mm.
Oliver!
Don't go to sleep darling cos your pizza's nearly ready.
Has he been busy?
Well we were rushing around.
Ali came about two I suppose and she's only just gone.
How's Odem?
He's lovely.
Did you have a bit of rain?
Well it was raining when they came.
And then it really brightened up.
Anne wanted to look round the garden so
Did she like the garden?
Mm.
She thought it was lovely.
She said a couple of those tall things are umm are weeds.
Foxgloves which are poisonous.
Yeah?
And  maybe if you feel up to it one evening this week you could go round and give it a dig up.
I mean if I tell you where I want dug over, then if you're not working at the weekend, we can umm  dig everything over and then, cos I mean that area down there, it would take no time at all for you to pave.
No.
You don't have to concrete them in, just put them in sand like you did before.
Like you did under the pagoda .
Cos anyway we used to walk on those and sit under there and it wasn't, didn't move did it?
Did she like me barbecue?
Mm.
She said oh  been saying he's gonna build one for five years but he's never got round to it.
And she likes the house?
Yeah.
She's definitely gonna have umm  a conservatory put on.
At the moment they use their sitting room umm as just somewhere to put  toys and washing and, just haven't decorated it or anything the dining room is still used like a living room, and what they really need is another room where they can.
Cos all their bedrooms are used up so they haven't got.
What they really need is another room where they can put  like the bigger toys you know.
Cos she said, didn't she say she wanted to move again?
They do want to move, but just can't afford it.
Because she doesn't earn much.
Doesn't earn much at all considering she works three days a week.
Ahmet don't earn a great deal does he?
He doesn't.
No he brings home less than two hundred pounds a week.
And he hasn't got a company car like you.
She's got a Fiesta.
Mm.

They look really nice cos of the red curtain.
I brought them down here but there isn't anywhere to put them.
Does Ann like it round here?
Mm.
Mm she loved the garden.
She said oh it makes our house and garden seem so small.
she said I can't let them do playdo I can't let them do painting she's just got nowhere to let them do anything.
Mind you, if we went back in our house now it would look so much smaller wouldn't it?
Yeah but we had the conservatory didn't we?
Mhm.
And I said to her having the conservatory does give you  a lot more extra space.
But then we've always had a spare bedroom haven't we, only having the one child.
Mhm.
Whereas they've had both bedrooms full up.
Yeah.
I mean Alia will be three in January.

She's like a whirlwind.
She's on the table ooh like this she's oh what's that and pull that down.

She just doesn't stop, under the table she said oh what's that card and the jug nearly came down.
And she's tipping the chalk out and she said what's that, oh that's the phone, under the table, pulled the rocking horse out.
Oh look at that picture.
And she just doesn't stop.
She emptied the whole toybox out.
Ann can't control her can she?
She doesn't try very hard.
No.
Went out in the garden and she's got a bike out and the scooter and the, and she's in the house now and she's just.
She was almost in the pond.
And Ann said come away.
No I'm just looking.
She, she wouldn't do it, she wouldn't come away.
And Ann just, oh  you'll fall in.
What about Odem?
Was he playing?
Mhm.
He just laughs all the time.

What drink did you have?

Don't know.

Don't know what the programme's called.

And that horse's got lost.

And and he don't know where to go.
Oh.
And he, and he fall down.
And 
Pardon?
What's cowboys got?
What've they got?
What cowboys?
Umm  horses and hats  and guns.
And what guns do?
Well guns are very, very nasty.
They go peeow peeow.
Peel peel .
They say 
Do they?
and they come out with the gun.
Look, they're on the horses now.
Where they going now mum.
They're going to find all the cows.
Mum, what's that man talking about?
Mummy.
Pardon darling.
Wh-, what's he talking for.
Well he's talking to the good man, isn't he.
He say.
He's a good man.
He's a good man isn't he?
Mhm.
.
Got a gun .
Mum, what's he got on his neck?
He's got a scarf.
Yes darling.
Mum where's my painting?
I put it away darling I thought you'd finished.
You can do some painting when you go to nursery can't you?
go to nursery.
Don't pull your jumper darling, please.
It's coming on!
Well watch it then.
Mm.
mummy 
Yeah, give me those scissors, you're not rushing around with those.
Are you eating this yoghurt?
What's that mummy?
Bang.
Umm, what we do, we're owned by Grattans.
We deliver parcels, all parcels for Grattans  and we also deliver for the Next Directory as well.
And it's self employment  so the couriers that we er supplied with the parcels with are  the p- umm  er, they're liable for tax and insurance if any is due, I mean  earn a certain amount of money before you start
Yeah.
and the rest of it's up  That is something that you'd have to find out 
But you are the 
Who me?
Yeah.
No, I'm o , I I'm employed by Grattans, and Grattans employ.
Anyway Grattan owns the  courier.
Yeah.
We own the depots.
In fact we could be called Grattan  Couriers but  we call it, we're called Direct Line.
Grattan Direct Line and we're just like a company  Grattan but Grattan own it sort of thing and  basically what it is, it's a daily delivery to the door.
Mhm.
And we work in postcode areas.
Mhm.
And we, well we work it all into sections so that in your postcode, in V R 1
Mhm.
it's divided    much easier to show you I think.
Right, take V R 1, okay it's that big slash line round there,in there.
Yeah.
Okay?
Now in V R 1 split up into five pieces.
postcodes V R 1 one something something, two something something, three or whatever.
Okay?
Now what we try and do is to put  into sectors.
Mhm.
So what we'll look at and say right, how many are going there, how many are going there.
Right there's enough parcels to make a nice little round so  and  she does that round.
Yeah.
Got another lady that goes to those two bits.
Another lady she'll have that, you see.
So we look at the rounds as being twenty to thirty parcels a day give or take.
Some day it might be a bit less other days it will be more thirty umm but on an average we like to work out the girls to about thirty to twenty five a day.
Which, when you look at it into time and money, yes we pay forty pence flat a parcel but the girls can go out, once they, once they know their area, they know the roads and they know where they are  they can go out and probably do about twenty parcels an hour.
When you  forty pee it's like eight pounds 
Yeah it's a lot of money per hour.
That's right.
work.
That's it.
Mm.
So, you work it out  take home an hour but to be realistic you've gotta take petrol out of it.
So let's just say, six pounds  and  costs because every day you know
Mm.
You're using your car.
That's it.
And you might be buying a sandwich, something like that so  realistically should be able to come out presuming twenty parcels in about an hour then get about five pounds.
That's realistically.
Yeah.
Er  obviously when you first start  and Kim found this as well, when she first started
Well she said she, well let's be honest, she really hated it
Yes.
She was going, she didn't know where she was
That's right.
taking up most of her day.
And then it just depended, it's up to you to get yourself  so if you know you're going, well say I was doing Hayes.
If I was going to see a friend in Hayes I would be crazy not to  
Deliver parcel  
on the way.
That's right.
But it's  why do two journeys.
Yeah.
People do fit it in around themselves.
Umm  we get some people, when I went to see Kim, d'you know where this is.
Oh yeah I know where all my roads are.
And  you don't, I mean you think you do.
But it's a case of, I've seen that
Mhm.
you know and it gets really frustrating.
And like  Kim'll be the first one to say  she gave up after a few months
Mm.
Yeah.
and said no, I can't do it.
Then, she thought about it 
Realised.
and said oh I did all the hard bit cos she did Christmas and remember that snow!
Snow, yeah.
She said really she did all the hard work, and then it became easier.
Mhm.
And, she's taken back on and she's okay now.
Yeah I mean when I saw her round the park she said oh I'm really enjoying it this 
I really felt for her actually in the snow.
You know it's, it's the money I mean why is anybody doing anything 
That's it.
I mean however much you like doing something you wouldn't do it if you did it for nothing.
No.
No  when you've got kids unless you're  unless you go back to work properly
Yeah.
You're earning a lot of money
Yeah.
you can't really, there's no point in childminding and nannies because your earnings  
Yeah.
Well you've got to be able to earn double, treble
Yeah.
to make it w-, to make it, to make it worthwhile.
Yeah.
And if you make the conscious decision to stay at home  then 
Yeah.
I mean I've stayed at home for nearly four years now.
Yes.
cos I'm not suddenly gonna to say to somebody now 
That's it.
started school 
That's right.
I enjoy it too much.
Does he go every afternoon or
No.
Just two afternoons a week.
When do they start him at school?
Umm he won't be going to school until  
Till next  one.
Yeah..
Yeah I mean he could go, he could go every day all day  but umm  don't enjoy it so I mean I enjoy it too much.
Especially if he's
I mean  it's an ideal job  you'd be able to fit a round in and do what you want to do.
Mhm.
Yes.
Now  the payments are, are different.
I mean you do get more than forty pee to do a parcel.
What we do is we pay Grattan forty pence across the board.
Yeah.
There's no specific time for delivery, that's where the bulk of the work is so if we're talking an average round being twenty five parcels a day between Grattan and Next Directory.
Right.
Now those Next Directory customers, they pay for a delivery service whereas with like the Grattan and it's free you don't  they pay for delivery and we guarantee that they will get forty eight hour delivery service
Yeah I've got a Next Directory.
Oh well you know the system yourself then, don't you?
Yeah.
Now what we'll do is, we can actually get it down to .
We'll get it to Kim a day before it's due
Mhm.
so on a Tuesday she'll get Next  for Wednesday, Wednesday  for Thursday etcetera.
So it gives her a little bit of leeway.
And what we say is as you know yourself you then have an am pm or an early evening call
Mhm
umm  an am and a pm during the week  cos that's just like the Grattan.
Mhm.
If it's an evening then we'll pay you sixty pee to do that.
But what we do say is  if Kim's got a Wednesday evening and it's only one, she's only got one
Mhm.
what we'll say to you is that you got that parcel on Tuesday
So it's up to you really.
Why don't you get rid of it and give that customer a twenty four hour delivery service
Mm.
and please yourself.
So as long as the Next directory is done early at all times
You still get your sixty pee even if you do do it in the day.
During the day .
Or  if you leave it with a neighbour then we've got a calling card to say  thought you might like it early
Mm.
Mm, Mm 
then , Mm
then they can't really.
No.
Umm  but if the neighbour will take it  sign the receipt but that's fine.
So again if  we do say that the
next directory , Umm 
you can still  suit yourself.
Yeah I mean my stuff's always on the last  but  
I never seen 
No.
He comes out and does the Next in the evenings  because a lot of it umm  Linda goes and does all her Grattan.
Yeah  three or four children so 
Yeah.
Yes.
I've never seen  her 
She probably, she will come round and do the day.
She'll probably do all the Grattan.
It's just the way they, they, they found it easier umm
Yeah.
he'll probably come out
Maybe he does shifts  maybe he's around 
 
So, what we say is that the more things are eight until  twelve .
Umm  it's Monday to Friday with Grattan and Next together, we do actually umm deliver on Saturdays for just Next.
Right.
And for that we'll pay the girls a retainer if you like to deliver from one customer to thirteen customers on that Saturday.
If they get one customer they get ten pounds but if they're unlucky enough to get thirteen they get ten pounds  .
ten pounds .
If they get any more than thirteen customers which is highly unlikely unless there's a sale on  then we'll get them  we'll give them twenty five pence per customer on top.
I see.
And  if they come to collect and return because we run a return service as well 
Yes.
then we pay them forty pee to collect and return to .
If they return, if their collecting the Grattan of Next returns all week it's .
Right.
The return system, we, we say to the girls they must come back  but they're to be incorporated within the round.
So they'll either phone Grattan or phone Next and it will come on what we call manifests, the green sheet you sign
Yeah.
is what we call a manifest.
And on that it will say an R for return or  whatever and give the girls instructions as to where to go to pick
umm , to pick 
Yes, yes .
Yes.
It's nice when you can do the two together
Yes.
because it's less bother then, you don't have to come back again.
So it it it gives, gives, gives the girls a lot of different sort of ways  break it up, fit it in and  and I'm making it sound very nice 
  
but when you first start  it is horrendous, it really is.
And  you, you get these parcels  
 
what we do is we map our route out.
Then we know  numbers on the parcels, one  twenty  the one you get is the one  
 
and it's a lot better  I know I've seen  road somewhere or you know it's a lot easier 
  
Well, like what?
I dunno.
Make me a cup of coffee if you're busy or something or
No, I'll make the coffee.
or umm
I bought us some brackets.
Oh did you?
Where you, where you said.
 Jean how much?
I got them in umm  you know in Penge it was  Payless wasn't it?
Where you turn left for Janet's it was on the right.
Yeah.
Yes, yeah I think so.
No it's Do It All now.
Oh.
That's Smith's isn't it, W H Smith's.
Mhm.
Six pounds for five.
Oh well.
So.
I think I need some more than that but that's all I had, the six pounds.
Oh good.
Well.
These aren't bra-, these aren't really, they're  shelf brackets.
That's what they're meant for.
Oh yes but they-, they're similar to what we've got holding that  
butter 
smaller because of the width of the shelves.
They're half the price of hanging basket
Oh.
hooks.
Well.
And that's what I've bought before.
Yeah, well what's the difference?
I mean you don't need the size do you?
And the basket's the thing.
Oh good.
I bought two small ones because I think I've got two small baskets.
So 
Oh good.
So I've got five.
One two three four five.
There's one in the garage I'm sure there was one left over in the garage.
I think you said there was.
So that's six.
What?
Oh!


The expensive watch.
It looks nice doesn't it?
Yeah.
I thought mummy was gonna keep it?
Well, she said let me  more than welcome but umm  well  when she came home it was in the  suede pouch and she said well  here y'are, here's you're watch, you know.
So I tried it and I thought, well wearing it.
It looks nice dunnit?
Mhm.
It's leather so I .
Genuine leather.
Smith's move  but made in Hong Kong.
Is it battery?
Yeah.
Well it looks nice dunnit?
Mhm.
Looks bigger than umm  Cos mummy had it with her when you came down  on Saturday.
Oh, did she?
It looks bigger than umm 
Bigger than you
Well when she put it on, didn't look that big.
But
When did I see it first then?
Right.
I must have been at, well I'm sure it was at home.
Yeah but I think she wasn't sure what she was gonna do.
No she said there you are, there's something for you.
She op-, give us the umm  after-, aftershave and deodorant which we said were the cheapest.
And er oh  eau de toi- whatever.
So she said well you know, at least I buy Aramis for Johnny and for you so the two purchases are not  just to get the watch.
And she er, I said oh.
And umm
I think she was undecided what she was gonna do.
I think may-, you know she thought maybe she might have kept it for an occasion
Ohh.
or something.
Anyway, she umm 
Pond needs cleaning out again as well.
Does it?
She said to the woman umm  I don't know, like is there any panic or , so she said well we've had quite a, only got five left.
Mummy said how long, she said well while the watches last.
I've only got five left.
But I don't know how many they had.
Not six I wouldn't have thought, or ten you know I dunno but umm
Never know do you?
and, what was funny in the ad it didn't say where.
Oh didn't it?
No  
maybe it was everywhere then.
Well yes.
So umm anyway.
Cos normally they'll say like Selfridges or Harrods or
Well I mean  said she got them in Dickens but she said Selfridges would be favourite probably.
But umm anyway.
Maybe they were doing it everywhere.
Mm.
Cos sometimes they'll say just House of Fraser stores or
Yeah, yeah
Debenhams or something.
I er
D'you wanna sandwich?
Not particularly.
D'you?
No.
I don't fancy one.
D'you wanna biscuit or something?
Umm  yeah I'll have a biscuit please.
Ohh.
There's a film for you.
Oh lovely, thank you.
neither here nor there but  twenty four.
Oh okay.
Doesn't matter does it?
Well, anything's better than nothing.
Yeah, so that's a twenty four, I mean you can have another  twenty four next .
I dunno I just grabbed it and umm
Ooh.
You can always get some more I would think.
Ah.
Well as he said  well he didn't say but I mean it's just a question of him putting them in the post.
How sensitive is the mike?
I'm not sure really.
Picks up the telly.
D'you wanna look at these?
Mm.
What d'you reckon she looks like Joan Simms?
That's what she  she said
Current, current Joan Simms that is.
Yeah, not carry on films Joan Simms.
No.
That's how crowded it was.
Uhum!
Deserted innit?
And I don't know why these didn't come out terribly  maybe because it was stormy and cloudy or whatever but, still.
Mm it is cloudy innit?
Mm.
I think that's where there was a storm brewing.
Dark aren't they?
Mm.
And that, well  that was so nice and I didn't know quite what that'd go, I just took that, that was the arrangement in the, in the foyer.
That looks nice dunnit?
They're those things that uncurl, aren't they?
These.
 Anthurium they are.
Are they?
They sort of uncurl don't they?
Mm.
South African thing.
That's the thing I didn't know about, and didn't ask anybody.
Mhm.
There.
.saying what's that, what's that so I took, I walked, I walked down and took a photograph of it.
Mhm.
That looks like a cross between a  orchid and a gladioli.
Dunnit?
Mhm.
That's from the verandah.
Mhm.
Lovely innit?
That's the park.
And  well  I dunno if I took a  continuity one round to the left.
Probably looking down I think, probably.
Well that's umm    Oh that's, is that similar?
Well that's sort of like, yes it's like that, yeah.
Mhm.
There's the tennis courts and you can see the beginning of, and the beaches round the corner.
And this was  San Key park.
Mhm.
And that's the  can you see it there, or is it that one.
Oh yeah  As close as that  that's the dreaded bridge.
Oh is it.
And you come over the bridge and the toll's this side of it.
So it was, an entrance to the park was here and the entrance to the hotel is there
Oh
so that's how close we were when we had the  blow out thing.
Thought I had a puncture today.
Well not cos I felt like it but I was at the lights in Bromley  this bloke, this, was stand-, sort of kept staring at my front  passenger side wheel.
He sort of walked away, he was staring like this 
Oh.
But umm  I sort of drove on for a bit and thought it feels alright and then when I got to that, you know B P petrol station, I pulled in and got out and had a look.
I thought maybe I've got a puncture and I can't feel it or something sticking out of it or something but  couldn't see anything.
He didn't say anything he was just like, but I mean he was really close.
He was like as close as that and he was really staring and he wasn't staring at the road cos as I went on a few feet he stared at the car again.
And, but he didn't sort of point and say anything.
I don't think we've got anything particularly unusual about our hubcaps or  well if they were really sort of amazing hubcaps then
Yeah.
but they're not.
Strange.
. So nothing er
Well I had a look and I couldn't see anything.
I mean he  for him to see it walking along the road if there was anything.
I mean  it's driving alright and I couldn't see anything sticking out of it.
Strange one again, but that's when, when I tried to get the lightning.
Oh.
That's when it was all happening.
And that's a crowded beach.
lovely sand isn't it?
Mhm.
That's where they set up the umm  these things for these 
Oh yeah 
these, these people that use the conference rooms, you know?
Mhm.
Cos that was St Petersberg catholic ladies guild or something and another day it was something like I B M or  whatever you know.
They run it rather like 
What sort of time was that?
Umm, do you reckon ?
Middling, late afternoon.
No-one there at all is there?
No.
That's the .
We were sort of waiting for the sunset thing.
That's, this was, oh I dunno what time it was, between seven and eight.
There's the swimming pool.
That's pretty innit?
Those palm trees are so funny the way the grow straight up.
Mm.
Mm.
There's the beach again.
Hmm.
There's that drinks thing where you sit all round on the high stalls you know 
Oh yeah.
the 
Nice innit?
Umm  this was sort of in  clear water, getting in more to clear water.
Tried to get it all in.
That was a s-, I dunno what it was, some  permanent  waterfall come mini golf thing.
It was a sort of  what you call public council grounds I suppose you know.
Mmm.
Nice innit.
Mmm.
That's, well just across the  sunset.
Oh that's lovely.
There's another one of the, well this was, that was cloudy.
Where is that?
From your room?
Umm  no  no, sort of, I think it was, wait a minute.
no, I dunno where that, I can't remember.
Could have been on that boardwalk thing that we spoke about just across the road.
Mm.
No it couldn't be cos that's the gulf where the sun goes down.
Oh yes that's  right, yeah.
Don't remember offhand.
There's the cabana things on the beach.
Hm.
Mummy had this thing about these, I don't know what you'd call them, pelicans I'd  no, not pelicans, what do they call them?
Flamingoes!
But not pink.
I managed to get one in flight.
They weren't, one or two seemed to hang around that thing where they used to throw out food to them.
What, in the hotel?
In the grounds, yeah.
Oh yeah used to walk around.
Ugh.
God!
What?
Oh they'd freak me out they would.
Really?
Umm
They're big, aren't they?
We-ell.
Yeah well they're not like pigeons are they?
Skinny,weigh about a pound and an half I would think that's all.
Yeah but they're about three foot tall or something.
Ugh 
Oh yes.
God!
Er  Paul again.
Cabanas.
So what are they, white  flamingoes?
Yeah white and very, very skinny.
They are flamingoes, not herons or something?
Well, I don't know.
I just don't know what they are.
But we didn't see any pink flamingoes.
They're not as big as the, don't know what they are, could be herons as you say.
These other things are just like pterodactyls.
The umm  with the big bill you know.
That scoop the fish out.
What  
Pelicans.
Yeah.
They keep them all under there.
Mhm.
The one's that are in St James's Park.
Oh, that was from the bus.
Yeah, we were back here.
This way.
And this is on the bus going in to Clearwater on the free  trolley as they call it.
Oh I know.
That was, I got it on the coach  quite a nice thing
Mhm.
over the bridge and into Clearwater proper.
Er  there's one of the things in full swing.
Oh yeah .
Now we drove up the road and looked at some of these, they're condominiums and a sort of  chalet type places.
I stopped and mummy said, cor that'll be lovely, should take one of that.
And they're they are.
There's a public access down to the beach  and I just turned round and took it and there's these places that you rent you know?
Mhm.
With the, there's the beach as you can see I mean it's 
It's lovely innit?
right there you know.
That'd be nice if we all went together a lot with Oliver wouldn't it?
Oh yeah  yeah wonderful.
No-one's got to go very far to take him down to the beach.
And we had a little  drive  to er  what was it called  Fast Eddy's.
Supposed to be quite well known.
And it was a place where one of these boats went  well one of those ones from the lunch, lunch on board you know.
Oh that's nice.
And there's the one before it left.
And we were there when it left.
And there's a walk.
A walk along with all the expensive yachts and all that round there you know you sort of approach it and walk along up here and 
Mhm.
get the, this was sort of part just along here 
there's paddle steamers along there.
Yeah, yeah.
And that's one the other way.
You have to have lunch if you go on them?
You can't just go on a trip or something?
No, no.
It's a, I dunno how much it was  
A lunch and 
leave about one o'clock every day.
About two hours.
And you can see it.
It goes back, well not far.
And it comes back up to like where we were.
Oh.
You could actually see it.
We saw it one day you know.
Turns round and goes back again.
That's one from the other direction.
And there's also some shots in there.
But whether they've been opened or closed it's like a white elephant, I mean lovely place, look.
Mhm.
But it was only about  two shops that showed any signs of life.
And they weren't open.
I mean shops had stuff in them.
There was an icecream place.
And there was another one with some, I dunno, gifts and souvenir but they were, they, and all the others were empty.
I mean there was nobody there at all.
So you don't know whether it had just been built and
Well it was newish but er  I mean one of the couriers mentioned it to us and I said well I dunno whether you want to pass the information on, whether you know, maybe you don't.
I said but if you intend sending people there I shouldn't bother
Nothing there!
because there's nothing to go for.
The shops are not open.
The two that were  said like, nine thirty to something which was like one o'clock, and it didn't say lunch  like you couldn't get any.
The only place that was open was this Fast Eddy's  for lunch and whatever you know, drinks.
Lovely place.
Mhm.
It's like over here though, that umm  Surrey Keynes where Bill and I went 
Is it.
No good?
And we drove down to another place, I think this was, it was just called the pub.
And we had a meal in there.
And sat outside, there again wherever you look I mean  what you pay god knows how much here for for views, you know.
Mmm.
Just sit there and look out, that's what you look onto.
Lovely innit.
That's that lot.
Mm.
They've come out nice haven't they?
Mm.
And this lot is some that I took down here.
No that was the room.
That's nice.
That's nice innit?
That was the front door.
That's the adjoining one that mummy  
Oh yeah.
Two double beds and the sliding doors and verandah was this way of course.
Mm.
Nice lot of space.
Oh yes.
Like drawers and cupboards and things.
And the Oh yeah.
And behind here, up there, was a big big deep shelf which took the suitcases comfortably.
Oh that's a good idea.
Underneath that, at waist level, was another shelf built into a recess.
Where we put all our  the kettle.
Mm.
The, the ice buckets and all that, you know.
Opposite that was the hand basin and round in behind the mirrors here was the bathroom.
Mhm.
Nice innit?
Mm.
That was the er  tells you what channels you can get what you pay for 
Oh yeah.
and what you don't.
I don't think we used all these.
There was, there was two more, two more 
No.
Loads of space.
along there.
And these, just, you just the handle, and the door is two  I think  both doors had three, full length mirrors.
And they just concertina open.
Mm.
And they, well, terrific size.
Mhm.
That was taken for a joke on the place that, god knows what it was, what it was.
I just said, I just said stop.
Uhuh.
Stop for a minute you know.
Uhum.
Mummy's birthday flowers.
Oh they look nice, don't they?
That's outside the front.
Nice trees.
In boxes with a bench.
On the boardwalk.
Hm.
On the boardwalk.
With Oliver's Disney carrier bag!
Yes.
That's wh-, must have been virtually the last day when we discovered the Disney shop across the road.
And of course it's so umm  as I say it's so crowded you know, look.
Uhuh!
You wouldn't believe it, would you?
Still I, it's out of season innit?
Wonder what it's like in  November.
Well Derek said, was it November or December through January and February, that's the, it's like seventy.
He said that's, it's beautiful then you know.
Mm.
What about the amount of people, does it really get crowded.
Well, I, I, I dunno.
I can't remember whether he said  yes or no.
Hm.
We walked there, it was quite a walk down to the water and you can see the depth of the 
Mhm.
Well from the hotel, we walked down  and just happened to take, and where, where this chap that we met at  that had this hotel in Eastbourne.
Either one  or the other was a place where he went and looked and he, he was going back in October.
Oh.
The, the um, you know, condominium things.
Mm.
Lovely sand though innit?
Mm.
Oh there's those bikes that go in the water!
Yeah.
Uhum.
They look really good fun, cos they're like pedalos but sort of different aren't they?
Yes they're back wheel drive and don't they with the
Did they have any of those umm  scooters.
Saw some yeah, I dunno where from.
Not, not, not immediate you know but sort of, they do go don't they?
Yeah.
There's another one of the  things going on.
Oh looks nice dunnit?
And barbie on the beach.
Mhm.
That's the grass area, the pool was there.
And we tended to come to this area, grass and there's that  bar thing again
Mhm.
the beach is down there, you can see the  things sticking up you  
The sky looks nice that day.
Oh yes.
I mean it was, like that virtually every day.
And I think  now these are some I took for your 
Uhum.

Certainly does.
That looks nice.
Hmhm.

Mhm.
So er  if you want to take all concerning you out I mean you know.
I don't mind.
It's up to you.
Well.
We could always see them again and
Yeah.

No.
They're more for you to er
Yeah.
Okay.
Thank you.
They've come out well, haven't they.
The holiday ones.
Mhm.
And we've got the negatives.
I mean, if  .
A lot of that stuff we've got out the back on the bank is umm honesty.
Which?
Up there on that bank.
This, you know  honesty
Mm.
That's what's growing up there.
Load of it.
Some of the flowers, those wild flowers have become honesty.
Really?
Mm.
Oh, well I didn't recognize it, not the honesty that I know.
Yeah it is.
Is it?
Cos it's green now.
Oh.
Then I suppose it just becomes that transparenty, whitey stuff.
Oh.
There's some at the front as well.
Some of those, you know the pinky and whitey flowers?
Mm.
Have become honesty.
Drill, extension, steps  brackets and a pen or pencil.
Now providing I've got all that I can be doing some while you you've gone.
Yeah well I'll be gone  sort of half an hour.
Mm.
So you're going in half an hour.
Yeah, then I'll be gone for half an hour.
Alright then  half an hour to get .
I was wondering is it worth me changing?
It's up to you.
You going out tonight?
No.
Umm  Mummy's, mummy ph-, oh and she's coming up with Brian.
Oh is she.
At five thirty.
So what are you gonna do?
Leave here about five then?
Well  fifteen  yeah, something like that.
Get home.
It doesn't matter if I'm not there but umm  you know with the time she's there and whatever.
Which one shall we use?
Ashtray ?
Well there's one being used already.
Somewhere.
Here you are.
Thankyou.
And mummy also mentioned something about .
Cos Brian told her that  they were doing a census  Sydenham.
And if I wanted, you know go another way or something.
And I thought well how long does it take.
And it was just down by  Lauries Park you know .
I always come, always turn right from home.
And then  come down Crystal Palace Park Road
Mm.
down, along all  Anyway, it was on the bend, and he just waved me they were still there  lunchtime 
Mhm 
or what I dunno.
He just waved me through.
So you haven't sussed the Newlands Park umm  way yet then?
Umm  Not properly, no.
I did .
Now what did I do when, one day last week.
Oh, I was going to Beckenham.
But I didn't come out where you said .
But I did something that I m-, should have done before, coming from umm  Volkspares 
That's where you need to go.
Yeah.
Down Volkspares Road.
And when you get sort of to   you have to go round and then you go like ro-, there's a big bend isn't there
Mhm.
like there's some council flats and you go down.
And then you turn right where there's that big  well it's sort of obvious where you turn right.
Umm  It's Leonard Road and then you turn right into umm  forget the name of the road now.
But as you go round that bend, there's a turning, as you go round the bend and you go down.
And I think it's signposted Penge or something and you turn right there.
And you carry on straight all the way down there and just carry on straight, and then you come to umm a road that Kent House Road goes that way  Kent House Lane or Kent House Road.
But you need to go sort of you, you have to sort of 
 
go over and like that and you go down Kings Hall Road.
Yeah I think that's what I do.
And where d'you come out?
You go all the way down Kings Hall Road.
And then you tu- you go all the way down all the way down, and then you turn right at Bridge Street.
You go over the bridge  and then you turn  and then if you're coming here, you go  turn right again into umm    d'you know I can never remember the name of the road, another road anyway you turn right.
And then you come out into Rectory Road.
Mm.
Just by umm  the station.
Oh well I didn't do that.
I saw Kent House and I thought.
Now I can't remember, if I go one way I'm gonna finish back up in
If you go to Kent House you just come straight back out into Beckenham.
Kent or something  I'll take a chance and I'll go this way and I went, and I came out  there's a garage on the way to Beckenham.
Yeah.
Well you see you need to go 
On the main road.
Thought well at least I'm heading in the right direction you know.
But you need to go the one over .
You need to go over.
Where the road is, you sh-, you should sort of come out like that and the main road sort of goes round like that and you need to sort of go like that.
You, you want to go  straight across but it isn't straight across it's sort of like that
Mm.
but it's umm Kings Hall Road.
Oh I'll, I'll have a look on the map.
And you sh-, I mean it takes from here to your place, going that way can take fifteen minutes.
I mean to get to Beckenham that way it takes.
As long as Bromley's alright it can take sort of eight minutes.
Mm.
But then going the direct way to get to Beckenham, it's only Bromley  that holds you up.
I don't know if umm  Jeff or, would know anybody or can do anything with this.
The back is sort of all  floppy.
The drill  the extension  and the steps.
Right.
Umm  Jazz F M phoned me this morning.
Oh did they?
Well I phoned them and said, I thought I'd leave it till this morning.
And I said er so and so .
Ohh I do remember.
I said well I don't expect you to.
Yes she said, the winner.
I said well  apparently yes.
The loser.
Doesn't seem to be.
So she said umm  I said well I haven't heard from anybody you know.
I've heard bits and pieces  that someone overheard a conversation with your Malcolm Laycock but I haven't heard anything since.
So she said oh I'll get Tim to ring you.
Are you going out.
I said yeah, one-ish.
Anyway within about half an hour he came on and umm, been on to the record company sorting out a couple of records that we hope are the things you like, plus  they were going to sort you out some tickets weren't they?
I said well it was mentioned.
So he said well it's all, it's all in hand he said and you know so.
Tickets for what?
Some, I dunno.
That I don't know.
These are a bit big I think.
Oh I mi-, I could possibly  might be better if Jeff  I think that all these, no these are too big.
Cos I didn't reckon on umm  I think
I think what it is is that, that thing there, that  I think this, and see that middle bit.
Yeah, that needs to be bent down.
To make it more
Like a spring.
Yeah.
So that it works as a spring at the moment, just  No you need something finer than this.
Bill used his umm trimmer edger.
Oh yeah.
Yeah, it's marvelous.
Is it?
Mhm.
No, it needs something to go in there, very fine and that to be bent down.
What d'you want?
I haven't got anything suitable.
I'm just looking at those to see if there's any weight on them it doesn't give any weight on those bags.
Doesn't it?
They used to be in  that size I, I can't remember now, that size used to be  I can't remember, no.
I mean half a crown size.
Can't see any umm .
More than a kilo innit?
More than two pounds.
Mhm.
I dunno.
It's gotta be dirt cheap, what, what .
Can't remember now.
Three fifty was it?
Four pounds or something like that I dunno.
Right.
Are we in the right area?
Yeah, umm  cos I bought these little ones cos I've got two little baskets.
Umm  wonder if a little one would be better here so it won't get knocked so much.
Mhm.
D'you reckon?
Yeah, you don't want it too low do you because umm 
Oliver can't reach it there.
No.
And  if you're coming round the corner you're not gonna knock that are you?
You've got 
No, no 
plenty of room whereas if you put a big one there.
Yeah well you have a look and, yeah well I mean.
Yeah, cos anything bigger is gonna get knocked, isn't it?
Yeah.
Yeah.
So put a little one there.
Right.
Right, that one goes there.
Umm  I think a big one here, cos I want to look at it from in there.
Mm.
Umm, the kids come round here to get all their toys so  there's a big sort of ridge there so it can't really go over that 
Oh yeah cos er the screws will hold it, I mean don't worry about that.
Well, just somewhere sort of, I mean it doesn't really matter.
Somewhere  it's gonna be seen so  and the higher the better because all the kids  oh there's the phone.
I'll go and get the phone.
Er can,can you drill into this concrete?
Well it looks as though there's a  a masonry drill there, yeah I would think so.
Cos you can't really put one on the fence.
Cos it's too thin, innit?
Mm.
And there's no way of 
You can't.
fixing it onto there, unless you've got like a 
Unless unless you bent it or something.
So maybe umm  one over there like that somewhere.
Well it doesn't really matter where, if I just tell you where, it doesn't matter where on there.
I mean the higher the better.
Yeah.
It's a shame we can't er  we can't bend them.
I mean that 
gonna be alright?
It's not gonna be in anybody's way.
No.
I mean the barbecue's here 
Can't  no.
Cos you can't screw into this fencing.
It's too thin.
Well  I'll have a go at drilling up there as high as poss.
Yeah.
level with the top.
Yeah, and then, that'll be like that.
Mm.
Yeah?
Yeah, because that, it's not gonna catch fire cos the barbecue's here.
And that's just a shelf, so when you've got the stuff coming out.
Yeah.
well you can always take it down anyway.
So one there.
So that's going up there.
Up there.
As high as possible.
Umm.
That one there, that one there.
Umm got another little one.
Umm, oh that's where I want one, here.
Well, one right over there or there.
Umm.
It can always be changed but I mean you've got the, got the lamp this side, and the barbecue.
So if I put the lamp basket here.
Well  bit more, it'll be too much one side
Yeah.
but that's up to you entirely.
Maybe a big one there.
Sort of there I suppose is it?
Well, it's in that line of con, just below that line of concrete and the top of the door.
Yeah well, yeah 
Which is that way isn't it?
Okay then.
So  Is that it?
Yup.
Right, come and have your drink.
there's a cup of
concrete in one.
That's good.
Umm don't do that darling to the flowers.
get the bumblebee.
Well the bumblebee doesn't want to be got.
I'm trying to trap a bumblebee.
You're trying to trap him?
Yes.
I don't think he wants to be trapped.

Yeah, why don't you just sit down and have our drink first.
And Del's gonna have his tea.
That's worked out good.

That bumblebee, there he is on the end there, look.
Where.
Don't hurt him.
I'm going to trap him.
He doesn't want to be trapped.
No, no.
Why?
Cos they're very good.
They do, I mean  they only, they only sting you if you, if you try and capture them.
If you trap them then they'll sting you.
If you trap them they get annoyed then they'll sting you.
But if you just leave them alone, he's doing  .
He's just having some dinner.
He's having some dinner in the, they eat, they eat the  thing in the flowers it's all like sweet sauce.
You don't really need to trap anything.
I do  trap.
Which is mine?
This one?
No, the other one.
The other one.
That one, no.
That mine?
