Alright?
Then I said, have you got him a house yet?
And she says it's strange, but there's no movement in the Conway Estate  there's usually a good turnover of people who're moving in and out.
Wait a minute  it's no good  there is no movement.
There usually is a, a, a, vacant houses  but at the minute it's at a standstill.
Right  so that means if there's nobody moving out, John can't move in?
He neither filling another form, I says well I'll fill it in tonight for him  he'll sign it  and if I post it tonight you'll probably get it tomorrow.
I won't be in the office she says until er  May the fifth  and nobody else will deal with it  so there you are.
This is what, April the what, the fifteenth, the sixteenth?
What is it?
About three weeks.
Yeah, well there you are.
Yesterday was the fourteenth, it is the fifteenth.
What?
What did he put down?
He didn't, he didn't fill it in.
Ah he says, what about talking money?
But he doesn't want to talk money  he's hoping to get that bitch to come back and live with him  and she doesn't like us!
Well you can't blame her.
Jean, we don't even have see them  you know what I mean?
He doesn't have to pass our door to get the bus stop, he doesn't have to pass our door to get to the schools
  
or the children.
He doesn't have to pass this way  to go to the shops.
It's 
It will be handy for me though.
I can't see her coming back really  I mean she might come back for 
Well Christ well what did you get yesterday  you found her clothes, her trousers and her knickers!
She must have been staying there at the weekend!
She might stay  for a a weekend or something, but I mean  erm

Now if she says why we were not here  or say  say she tells you she called on Saturday and we were out  just say to her   Raymond was drinking stout!
Fuck her   I was drinking stout  on Saturday night  and normally don't do it  because  we've simply no money!on the vodka  and say it wasn't even enough to buy a carry out  but don't say it unless she says she was here!
Oh  can't see her coming for Saturday night.
No.
She was here on Friday night.
She mentioned the silver teapot to John.
I said to him we made her a cup of coffee out of a teapot that was bought   and she says she was talking about it.
I didn't want John thinking that  I said  he would get her one.
No,


There's toilet rolls in there .
In that top one?
Aha.
Can you not put them in the bottom of the cupboard and get rid of that bag?
Jean, that's what drawers are for!everything, look at that dir lo look at that now!
I can  take some down and put them in the cupboard.
Are you sure Jean there's not a box of soap in there?
Aha.
There  is.

No it's not    the soap  in that box is lying down in the coal hole.
What?
The soap out of the box is lying in the coal hole, the empty box is in the bin.
Okay.
Hey listen  you see these er  the stuff you have in that cupboard there, the hot press.
Aha.
Now, you'll have to go through it  right?
There's no use in keeping things that you're not gonna use  okay?
Now you, if you get rid of a lot of, of a lot of the rubbish  right?
Do you realize  how quickly your clothes would dry in there  in the hot press?
All of them.
No serious, in summer, it's alright now  good wind blow  you can get the clothes dried  in a reasonable time  but in the winter  you can't
I know.
right?
They would even dry quicker than  if you put them over the clothes horse  cos that's what those slats are for.
There's no use keeping things you don't need Jean, and you don't know anybody that needs them!
John  never mind him!
If he gets a house he'll need curtains, putting his curtains up.
Ha for God's sake Jean if she's gonna move back with him  she'll not want your stuff!
That's why she won't move back in with him, cos she says there's too much stuff there reminds him  reminds her of her  his ma  or your ma.
I think she was glad to take it all mine.
at the time Jean.
I don't want to ge to get involved, but you just can't help  and I don't want any of this shit out!
Now  watch this
And from what I've heard about her she's always  her mouth now!

Unless she says she going to so to go over and spend a weekend now and again with her kids but er  that sounds right.
Aye, but
And he doesn't be there.
But, I, what I can't understand is, why all of a sudden does he want her back and see the children, well for over a year he kept her away?
Told the children lies.
Unless he doesn't know she living with someone.
You know that saying Jean?
No.
Oh what a tangled web we weave  when first we practice to deceive.
What's that?
This dog here's taking over this house!
I know.
John's dog's not too well.
No?
No.
What's wrong with him?
He's very listless.
I said to Kelly Ann today, maybe it's fucking, erm sorry, maybe he's dying.
Cor!
I shouldn't have said it.
Sure Brandy's fighting.
I was telling Stephen today the story of a  did I ever tell you?
No.
Did I ever tell you Raymond?
My first job driving a lifting in the Harrow Street?
No.
There was a Mr and Mrs , Stephen was   and there was a Mr and Mrs , the caretakers, and they lived in the third floor of a flat there.
And, the first day I started  right enough, they were awful kind, awful kind  they were English people, I think.
They were.
He had a bad arm.
But anyway, er    well I'd, God forgive me!
He's laughing, the boy!
Raymond's jumping about laughing!
I dunno, er yes, I was eating jam, bread and jam today.
And anyway, the first day  she gave me  right enough, she came round every morning  with my breakfast  and brought it into the lift for me.
But, the first day she gave me  bread with jam and butter on it.
Now, you know I can take jam or butter
But not butter and jam.
That's the most revolting taste!
And instead,instead of telling the woman  I  I pretended to eat it  couldn't finish it  I put it down the lift shaft.
See?
Oh Christ, no!
The next morning the same thing happened  and I still hadn't the courage to tell her.
Cos I was that grateful for her, you know, making it.
Ya.
Jesus Christ, Jean!
You wanna have seen the butter and the jam, and the smell of it!
I can smell it now!
Oh God!
But anyway  this went on for weeks and weeks, and I kept on it down the lift shaft.
Instead of taking it out to the back and throwing it in the bin.
Mm.
Or you could 
Right.
keep it in your pocket and take it home.
Never thi never thinking!
The lift shaft was about  three foot deep.
Sorry!
Th the the well of the lift, you know from the  er,ju , when you went to the bottom floor
Aye, at the bottom, right.
I would say there was a drop of about three feet, right?
Down.
So anyway, after fucking weeks and weeks and weeks  I had  come out to me one day, and Mr  came out and he said to me  he had a wee bucket and shovels and he says er  bring me down to the first floor  so I opened to let him out and he gets out and he says to me, now take her half way between the first and second floor and stop her.
And I says okay, but why ?
He says I'm gonna clean the lift shaft.
Oh!
Well Holy  Jesus !
Oh God!
Clean it?
He says, I clean it every now and again.
People throwing, you know, cigarette packets and all down it.
Oh my God!
So when I couldn't say a word, so he was able to open the lift door, you see, from outside.
Yeah.
The lift was immobilized.
Once the door was open it couldn't move, so I couldn't go down on it.
Well he jumps down into the fucking lift shaft and he slipped on i oh eh well you fucking bastard you!
You bastard!
Honest to God Jean!


He slipped on the jam and the bread  and the butter.
Must have been bloody moulded and everything.
Bloody moulded!
Jesus
Oh hell!
Christ!
Oh my God, Jean!
What did you say?
What could I say?
It came up on his elbows and all, and his trousers were covered and there's bloody jam, er this concoction!
Oh Jesus!
Jesus!
That's terrible, isn't it?
No, they were, they were awful kind.
I forget what I said to them but the they forgot, the next, I don't think I got a bit of grub ever, since then.
Do you blame them?
Not until he left.


But I  it was only butter and the jam today that er,thi this came into my head.
Oh my God!


That was nineteen fifty three.
This is nineteen ninety two.
And I, every now and again I'm embarrassed by it.
Every now and again I think about it  and I'm deeply embarrassed.
You should be.
After doing that to her cooking!
Jean.
When he slipped in that  muck  he could have cracked his head against the side of the lift shaft!
And I couldn't have been, I couldn't get out to help him  I was stuck between the first and second floor!
Well I took it up about six or seven feet, you know, from the ground floor.
Mm.
When I say the first floor, I'm talking about the ground floor and the first floor, you know?
Drink your coffee lovey.
.Well in that  today he says er  when I seen the syringe coming out I just, I'll not be in the room if he's getting injected.
I wouldn't have let him give it to me.
Remember the time I took to vertigo?
And the minute he walks through your bedroom door, I says no.
I don't want any injections.
I was in the toilet, giving him a shot,and  I come back in and he just stuck in the syringe, there was nothing you could do.
Did he take a sample of urine away?
No, he went out to the car and brought my cards, he said he'd got it in my notes.
Oh!
And what did he say?
He says his urine was alright and his was al 
Oh well, that's good.
alright.
But he said there's all 
Oh!
He won't take a breakfast in the mornings any more.
He goes straight to work.
And th , and then he said talking about putting weight on nearly.
What did he say?
He asked , erm has he put any weight on?
And I have said yes, because  there's a couple pairs of his trousers  has ripped because he has put weight on.
Right.
But he didn't say anything when I said he has put a bit of weight on.
Raymond.
Drink affects us all different.
There are no two people affected by drink  the same way.
I know.
Now we're all individuals when it comes to that.
Now, you could be one of the people  that drink harmed quicker  than maybe, say  or maybe I'm  ta injured quicker than you with drink.
I mean, there are people who can drink va vast quantities  never seems to affect them.
They're up like a lark the next morning.
Jesus!
Me, like I mean, that's got now, my age, I'm not fit for three days!
Well, for two days anyway.
But, it's possible  that, the same amount of drink, two people drink, taking the same amount of drink  one is affected more badly than the other, or worse than the other.
Yo it's possible you could be one of those.
So you wanna be careful, like.
There's no way, Raymond, you should be able to drink  two or three of those bottles o of that cider  in ne in the one night, it's not good for you!
Or vodka either!
Well you, you don't drink that amount, but you know what I mean.
Stop,.
Jean I'd love a vodka now!
I'd a love a vodka and coke!
I'd give al almost anything.
Would you now?

Raymond said to me the other day, I asked him was there any lemonade?
And he said yes.
He went up and got a bottle of  Sasperella he said to me there was two bottles left.
So when the  Sasperella was brought down, that was at the end of it.
And there was two bottles 
Yeah cos you had the rest of the orange ?

Well did she not know she was doing this?
put her dick out,bone in it.
and he looked all round the room and that and then 
It's funny now, she said it  as if she was you know under pressure, and she had to get up,I remember one night as if somebody was very quietly  you know putting a blanket over me, that's honest.
Oh fuck so you struggled, you couldn't speak, you know

So we went away into this place called Short Strand
I know it well.

Yeah.

Oh 
and this girl says if you go to the very top you'll get it done
Right.
it's an old, old house but she says  at the top of the house
Ah.
but when we got up to the top of the house I needed to go to the toilet.
She says to me if you sit in between them two old men  and do it.
And I said I'm not sitting between two men
Right.
she said they'll not know you're doing it, I swear 
Doing what?
Going to the toilet.
Oh!
I wanted to go to the toilet
Right.
you know before I got my hair done.
And I says oh God no I couldn't sit between, she says I swear they'll not know you're doing it.
So I sit in between these two men and I   
Did what you had to do eh?
But I felt it coming out and all that
Right
I'd done it.
And  the next thing I went in and this girl was doing my hair  I don't know what she was doing   but I can't remember the, the dream was  he says to me Dawn do you want these curling tongs left on  I said what curling tongs

Honestly, and the tongs were still on, and that was at eight o'clock in the morning.
Did you dream that dream just the once then?
Aha.

Our William was standing in the rain from half five trying to get into our house
Oh Jesus.
I opened my eyes at fucking five to six and I could see him at the window  Ken  ran then across the road and he says Dawn your brother's been trying to get in for ages.
and he was soaked, he actually had tried first  then he went round the back, the back door was closed so he tried to take shelter under the oil tank
Yes.
God help him.
he sat there 
Jesus.
I tried the back again, he  bladdered it and he  bladdered the f front, but says he was just about to go when I opened one eye.
So I says  round the back or something.
And I opened the door and let him in and he was telling me I've been here half an hour trying to get in.
His dinner was l sitting under the grill, I lift it out, set it on the fucking table, and I says I'm away in here to waken
Aye

He'd fucking had his dinner at six o'clock, I don't even know what  I rang the club later, I tell you like, twenty past he'd arrived at the club and he was early,where'd you go?
I left about ten to seven to go and get the seven o'clock bus

But you see now  come in for dinner after my dinner 
Aye

One night, there was one night here about  er half nine I was really tired but, with them being out I wasn't, you know, I like to go to bed when they come in  and I was so tired  when they come in  when I got up  
 
I was overtired and I couldn't go off to sleep.
And I remember saying one time to our doctor 
 
about being tired and  the same thing happened, waiting on them coming in and then going to bed and I couldn't get over
Aye
and she says well, it was  Doctor   but Jean she says you've been so tired you should've went of bed when you felt tired because with sitting
Mhm
you've been overtired and you haven't been able to get to sleep very well.
I says well I never knew you could be overtired she says oh yes you can.
Oh yes if something's on your mind you can't sleep at all.
That's right.
Well I fucking done th see last Thursday I done our front garden and our back garden, I don't know what fucking else I didn't do, and then I was storming out and  the fucking dishes Willy 
I said I've fucking done the ga and like I normally, soon as our dinner's finished I don't even take a cigarette, I wash all the dishes and dry them, wash the cooker  
 
the table and then put a cup of coffee on
Aye
and  a cup of coffee and a cigarette, and I always do that but this day I was so tired after the doing the garden, both gardens like  and fucking weeding them all and doing everything else and  brushing out the back and doing   I said to him for fuck's sake do them dishes for me for a change William would you I said, so I got er got myself in the bath  said I'm away to bingo, so William's gone out what happened?eight, I had eight  he had one  you may get yourself  I said ah fuck no wonder I have no fucking luck, so  on the settee and said I'm not going anywhere, I sat for ten minutes then I said  ah fuck you why should I sit here  so I lifted the car keys and walked out again then, fucking zooming out of and there was John  coming up like that
Oh
what's happening?fucking dishes aren't even  they were actually sitting on the table
Yeah
the way I'd left them.
Nothing was touched in the kitchen.
I mean the deep fat fryer, the lid was off and the pots are sitting 
 
Yeah 
on the thing and I said well he'll have to be fucking stretched  if they come to that door and none of them dishes  and the best of it was the front door wouldn't open
Oh
and I says then we'll have to come in the back and all them dishes standing there  and, and that's one thing John hates, if any of his ones come up  
Och aye  yeah 
Well fuck when I come back up he near had the fucking  front door broke trying to get it open so that they'd come in the front and I see the  kitchen door's closed  and I just walked in and I said well John  the dishes or nothing's done if you wanna go and have a look because he wouldn't do them.
I just fucking told them straight, I said we had an argument and I never done it
Well you didn't go to bingo then?
No  
When you saw them, you come back yeah 
Well I er I came  back because I thought to myself 
You had to come back.
well  like you know?
Well that's true.
So now I just don't give a shit, I do the dishes and  
 
Well now you see the week that William's down the John's, in John's and they'll tell you  all erm once the tea's over the dishes, I do the dishes right away
Sure I do though.

Cup of coffee your mum's gonna make for Dawn.
and for  and   
Jim does that.
Jim  
No don't, no, not normally Jean I don't.
and  in the head  I says they could be washed, and dried and put away.
But then Raymond's gotten now 
No I don't normally do that.
that he'll wash the dishes
And then leave them on the rack.
I've seen them sitting down to their dinner no no
and leave them on the rack and  
I see them down to their dinner and I have the pots done before I take a bite
Aye
Oh aye.
But Raymond's way of doing the dishes 
I hate dishes sitting done, oh fuck I

Forget it, forget it 
Well I have, I don't know how many, Jim does not like doing dishes, I don't like doing dishes  
Oh I don't mind, I don't mind.

I'm leaving them now for you, I'm not doing them and I'll leave every fucking plate in this house till you do them because I'm sick of it.
But do you, you know the best way to do it?
Now say for instance er I do the pots
Aye
because there's no room in the wee 
Rack, aye 
rack for fucking plates, so I put them away and the best way to do it is if   sit at the table , you wash and I'll dry or I'll dr you er dry and I'll wash, well what 
Jim wouldn't.
Jim  sticks them all in that rack  
Half, half the time 
Raymond  
Aha
Yeah

But all 
then get the dryer, dry them, do the tops and then it's all done.
Yes, yes but if you do that  you're, you're, you're tea towel's soaking and at the end of the night 
 
nothing's getting dried.
You can dry no gla a gla what does a glass look like if it's had a di dry with a damp cloth?
I do all my glasses first 
Fuck all 
Raymond.
Oh well it, right enough, yeah.
I just do all my glasses first, and leave them on the draining board 
Do a cup of coffee now Jean for God's 
because by the time you've got all the dishes done, the glasses have all drained off and then 
Aha 
I dry them first and put them away 
I do that 
and then put  
Aha 
the plates and cups  
That's right  that's right.
But then I fucking  
I hate dishes.
And I hate anything sitting on the table top.
Aye.
If I had, if I had room I'd have nothing, toaster and that  I hate it all 
That's right.
But yet I happened to say to Carole one night, she says no I love to see what I bloody own  well I suppose it's  you've got microwave and a wee oven or whatever 
Well my fucking, my deep fat fryer's sitting out  we got an electric one we used to have the one that was on the cooker
Aha.
Electric one's far safer isn't it?
Oh aye
that one that was on the cooker.
Mhm.
And see when we got the hob 
I wouldn't have one about now.
remember when we switched 
Yes 
the hob?
Jim says we'll get an electric one because you don't want a new thing sitting in there and erm  it sits in the corner cos I have no room in my units for it.
Oh we've plenty of room there for that you know.
But then the 
I've got 
minute it's cold I put it in
Aye see I've no room.
put the lid on it and put it in.
But they're far safer Dawn.
Aye.
But sure here's me and all, right we'll get a new set of pots for this hob and we'll not destroy them
Aye.
I fucking let milk boil over the other night and I can't get it off.
Well 
we got the hob clean
Oh right
right, it's no good, let me tell you, it's fucking useless.
Jim says that some man he was doing a job for
Use Jif.
No apparently it takes the whole top of it
Och I use Jif.
I'll tell you what I do  you know like it goes black?
Aye
.
You see a paint scraper?
Mm.
I scrape it.
Do you really?
Oh aye.
Scrape it, then I get the Jif  on my finger, you know round the cloth round the finger
Mhm.
do that.
Tea?
Please.
Do you want  
But er I'll tell you the most dangerous thing  a tin of peas, if you put it into your pot there's sugar in it, if you look at that, the ingredients
Aha
on a tin of Batchelor, there's sugar in them
Mm
right?
Now one day, you can't leave it on the hob, one day we were sitting here and I don't normally, if I put anything on I sit in there rea you've seen me go in on a Sunday
Aye
reading the paper and all while I'm watching whatever's on
Aye
but we let it run over and the sugar   the hob  and it, there's, there's a chunk out of it
You're joking.
it's actually bubbled the glass, there's a big groove in it, you can see it in the back ring, I'm telling you.
And if we'd 
So even a bit of custard would
if we, if we'd've left it long enough
Aha
it would  right through the element.
But I use a paint scraper.
Now, I mean if you run your finger over it, right?
Aha
And you can feel where, where the rough edge is
Aha
and you just very easy  with Jif  that  
some man tell him  is it a spray or a lotion or something?
Some type, some type of liquid.
I would say well use Mr Muscle on it  oven cleaner, but you have to  
Dawn how much sugar in your coffee?
Two.

wh where you put it.
I've used a paint scraper.
See the milk pot, I made the, Jim likes milky coffee

Right 
and I went out to tell him and he started talking to me for something and when I came back in the fucking milk!
Oh we 
And there with the heat on still it all just burnt to hell 
That's right that's right.
But it's still, Raymond I can't get it off.
Well I, I've, but er, no but er the only reason you haven't got it off, if you use Jif, I've used Jif
And I put that hob cleaner and all on it like.
Well I don't know what it does, but the only reason you can't get it off is you're not working it, it's hard work to get it off Dawn.
Oh.
Well I'll show you the, the what do you call it, the back, what the sugar did, and I'm putting it down to sugar.

So I'm sitting  all I can hear, I'll never forget it   ah God help him   fucking somebody from    ah Go God help him   next thing  will we get an ambulance ?
Say no I'm alright  and I must've lifted my head, all I could hear was this old scraggy voice like a witch,ah serve the fucking bastard right,the fucking    honest to fuck, so I must've sat for another half an hour and I knew I had to go that way to get home.
I ended up on the front fucking wheels of a pushbike


I swear to God, in Willington Place I'll, pitch black, never forget it.
And all I remember was saying  oh!
There between my legs, the front wheels, and I ended up holding the handlebars and staring into this wee boy's face  a look of sheer fucking terror on his face,


fucking, oh j I don't know how I got home.
All I can hear to this, to this day  remember is flashing lights and doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo go home you bastard!
Doo  I must've crossed every fucking road
Well Peter  I sa la one night last week oh it was the week before I was going up past  and this fella was walking and he was fucking staggering and he was going on the road and Peter's came back and fucking  him.
Oh aye?
Ah  
Sure her her sister was coming er down, er t Carole was coming down Donegal Avenue one night and said to John  fuck some woman's gonna have a rough time  she says 
?
ah she said she saw this fella hitting the wall and hitting the football  halfway out in the road, it was fucking me.


oh Christ!
Ah but everybod er sorry, they did things for me 
Oh aye
bastard.
Do you not see her much Jean?
if you ev if she ever says to you  she hasn't seen you since whatever it was, you say Carole it works both ways, I haven't seen you either.
Like I mean  if I  like five minutes we're all down to  
Aha that's right.
but then her excuse would be  but I mean  he can't be on shift 
He's not on shift work every week.
every week if you 
No.
know what I mean.
No that's right.
Like she wasn't too busy when she brought the youngsters 
And  
home last Saturday, or whatever it was, to come round.
She wasn't even with him, it was him brought them round himself.
Who?
John.
See she'll always 
John's kids and Sandra's?
No they're John's  
No, no no no once every .
She buys them  and takes them to  and all 
  
but the point is she uses us to get to John, so it's like  would you ask John.
And I feel like saying  
Instead of going fucking asking herself.
Yes exactly.
Exactly.
Mhm.
You know th the statement 
 
a mother keeps a family together, which I think's true, and then when the mother goes  the family are   still keep in contact  
Well no, a mother, a mother might keep a family together in the sense that they all meet there on a Saturday
Mhm
but a mother can't make the family like each other any better
That's right.
you know?
They can't.
See your mum was te terrorized of Carole
She wasn't?
Aye she was afraid of Carole sure  
Yes.
on a Saturday when she used to come.
 
 
And that's wrong but if you, if you told Carole that she wouldn't believe you.
But I know she was.
And I'll tell you better than that 
aye sure she  oh Jesus Christ our Carole's coming.
I'll tell you better than that and I didn't know until her John told me.
He says do you know that they get cooked ham sandwiches and you get toast?
I says you're joking.
Well who gets cooked ham sandwiches?
When Carole and John  went down, they were sat down, cooked ham sandwiches.
When Jean and I went down the toaster was put on.
We got toast.
I didn't know it 
 
used to get the ham for Carole, that's right,
Yes, mhm.
Aha.
And made them a f and they look for their fry every Saturday and I stopped  doing it.
Like when your mother got to that age, as John  told me, you bring her in the food
That's right.
Ah
she doesn't bring it in for you.
That's right.
Now I thought it was wrong, I even stopped them getting a fry.

And er she says er  the next thing was that  if er, she says she heard him saying if you let me play in your back garden, this  that he's playing with, we'll give you a sweet.
And she says er oh, she says, she   and she says  and she says Ashley  come on you don't need sweet their sweets  and you're not gonna be blackmailed.
There's sweets here, there's plenty of sweets for you, come over here and play.
And she sent the er kids over to her house with an Easter egg each, you know?
Mhm.
And there were a tap at the door  and the hand come out
?
just took the Easter eggs and slammed the door in her face.
And she says Jean you know  well you can see er she says  you know the day before Ros was in Lisburn and she says you know the way when you're standing and from the back you can feel somebody that their eyes are penetrating through you  and she said she happened to turn round and there she's sitting in, in this girl's car and just er looked at her  like that.
And she says I just turned away too.
Nothing.
And er she says Jean I swear to God she says if she comes over near my door, I've told Jim she says, I, I'm ready for her  I'll beat her round that square and she said I'm not like that but she says that's just the way she says, and she hurt my kids  when I sent them Easter eggs over, doing that she says, that really galled me, she says cos they were hurting my kids rather than me.
Oh aye.
And er she says like when I think of me keeping her child overnight and all  before it's in hospital and running down to hospital three or four times when he was in the hospital, and taking him sweets and all, and she says she's treating me like shit  .
dad.
Right.
Right.
And er  she says not only that she says er  David is er  saying to er Michelle come on and play with me and er come on in and play with me and, when Michelle will go in, he pushes Ashley out of the road and says well you're not getting into my house.
Did Johnny give you a kick there?

And, ah, oh aye, and she says they're out playing and the s and she says you know what kids are like Jean, and she says like I wouldn't try even to say to my kids not to go near them because you wouldn't  tell them because they're only kids  and she says they're like playing in the square and she says like I would  David and  down here you know when I was coming down
That's right.
she says but she come out and got her wee one in the car and not David and the wee, the other wee boy into the car and left Michelle or Ashley standing there and drove off.
And then er when they came back he says  she says you know and I just says  er and when she got out of the car, Dawn was out in the gar in the garden walking, and she said she just got out of the car and she looked over at Dawn like that  took the kids in and she said I just says  here you are, she said, come on Ashley over here, you stay and play in your back and your side of the er street from now on .
But it's no way to settle an argument by ignoring it you know it or  letting your er letting your 
She says  
mind run riot.
You, I mean, if she  if she likes the girl, which she obviously does, why not just rap her door or wait till she sees her and say you know 
 
whatever you call it, did I do something on you, and why are you treating me like that but th
