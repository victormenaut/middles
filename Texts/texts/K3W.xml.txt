Prayer to the planners
Church wants room to grow
By Carl Butler Daily Post Staff
A CHURCH is praying that local planners will have a change of heart.
The Church In Wales has been refused permission for a new church in the centre of Mynydd Isa.
Its existing church, the 101year-old St Cecilia's, on the junction of Chambers Lane and Mold Road, is too small to cope with a growing congregation and cannot be extended.
However, Delyn Borough Council says a new church next to the Mynydd Isa community centre would create parking problems and take away one of the last remaining green spaces in the sprawling housing estates near Mold.
The Vicar of Bistre, the Rev Jason Kennett-Orpwood, said yesterday: ‘We've now written to the whole council, and so too have a lot of the parishioners, to ask it to reconsider.
For the most part, I'm hopeful it will be brought up again later this month.’
Delyn's chief planning officer, Chris Thomas, said the council owned the land which the church wanted to buy.
He added that the committee was concerned about the lack of car parking spaces on the proposed site and the loss of what was one of the last open spaces in Mynydd Isa if a new church were allowed there.
Mr Kennett-Orpwood said: ‘There's a need for a church building in this particular area and I don't think the committee has considered this in reaching its decision.’
The present church can hold only 60–70 people.
Mr Kennett-Orpwood said: ‘When we have our family services we get up to 100 people coming and at the moment we have to hire the community centre once a month for our family services.
The parish has already looked into the possibility of extending the existing church, but we've been advised by Delyn that such an application would be rejected because of lack of parking facilities.
‘We also examined the possibility of converting a disused chapel down the road.
But it's even further from the centre of population and would also create parking difficulties.’
The vicar added that unless the new church was allowed three years' hard work would have been wasted.
‘I do hope they listen,’ he said.
‘I can't see anywhere else a new church can be built in Mynydd Isa.’
The Church in Wales is soon to appoint a full-time priest to help in the area.
‘The potential is tremendous.
I only hope that Delyn will see that as well,’ said Mr Kennett-Orpwood.
NEW YORK, Friday, 10pm: STOCKS staged a fairly broad advance after encouraging inflation figures and other economic news sent interest rates tumbling in the bond market.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 13.29 to 3,505.01.
NYSE volume totalled 253.47 million shares, against 230.64 million in the previous session.
The NYSE's composite index moved ahead by 0.71 to 246.24.
Trade gap stays stable
THE first glimpse of Britain's trading position with the rest of the world this year showed today that the trade gap remained broadly stable.
Provisional figures published by the Central Statistical Office showed the deficit for the three months to the end of March was £4.5bn, compared with £4.35bn the previous quarter.
The figures are bang in line with City expectations but still show Britain's trade gap remains a problem for the government.
Today's numbers are the first to include statistics on trade with the EC since the single market came into force at the start of the year.
Over the past six months statistics have been gathered by a new Europe-wide service.
Both imports and exports were shown to be growing at a similar rate.
Export values rose 7% to £29.6bn while imports were up 6.5% to £34.1bn.
The underlying picture, which excludes oil and erratic items such as aircraft parts and precious stones, told broadly the same story exports were up 5.2% to £25.7bn and imports climbed 5% to £30.9bn.
Statisticians warned that the figures could be subject to greater revision than usual.
The trade deficit with countries outside the EC grew marginally to £3.4bn while the gap with the EC narrowed to £1.1bn from £1.12bn.
The government has forecast a year in deficit of £17.5bn after the £12bn shortfall in 1992.
BRITISH industry is going Dutch, according to a new study.
Firms from the Netherlands have increased their ownership of British subsidiaries by nearly a quarter.
The rise from 1,033 in 1992 to 1,289 takes the Dutch to fourth place in Dun and Bradstreet's table of owner-ship.
US parent companies come top.
The French figure is up 13% to 1,751.
Partnership seminar in city
DUKE TO SPEAK AT CONFERENCE
Philippa Bellis
THE DUKE of Westminster will address a highpowered think tank promoting partnership between the public and private sector in Liverpool next week.
The national conference will bring together chairmen and chief executives of business partnerships, City Challenges and TECs.
It aims to look at how the private sector has and can increase its involvement in local and urban regeneration.
A spokeswoman for Business in the Community said: ‘John Major's CBI speech on the economy made reference to the need for more partnerships between the public and private sector.
‘Against a background of recession and unemployment, the crucial nature and value of area partnerships between the private and public sectors have never been clearer.
‘We have seen evidence of this in initiatives like City Challenge and TECs.
The CC programme has highlighted the vital contribution the private sector can make to urban regeneration.’
The conference will be held at the Atlantic Tower Hotel on June 16 and 17.
Speakers include the Duke of Westminster, Alun Michael, MP for Cardiff South and Penarth and Shadow Frontbench spokesman and Julia Cleverdon, chief executive of Business in the Community.
Workshops tackling issues raised by speakers will be held.
They will look at partnerships in the North West such as Ravenhead Renaissance in St Helens, the Blackburn Partnership and East Manchester Partnership.
There will be a tour of regeneration projects, ending at the Albert Dock.
The spokeswoman added: ‘It is an exciting mark of the success of the business partnership movement that its spread is picking up speed.
‘The conference will offer opportunities for people to share experiences, learn from each other and develop new strategies.’
TRADE GAP:
Britain's trade gap with rest of world remained broadly stable in first three months of the year, according to provisional Government figures.
Deficit, excluding invisible items such as banking and insurance, was £4.5 billion, compared with £4.35 billion in previous three months.

English China Clay constructs its new future
ENGLISH China Clays today announced plans to pull out of construction materials as it unveiled a £202.3m US acquisition.
It is buying the US speciality chemicals company Calgon as part of its strategy of concentrating on industrial minerals.
The construction materials division, which employs more than 4,200 people, is to be floated as a separate company.
The housebuilding division is already being wound down.
The US acquisition is being partly funded by a £113.4m rights issue of new shares the second the Reading-based company has launched within 15 months.
Details of the demerger plan would be published later, the company said.
The new developments are part of a five-year programme.

They are searching for passengers who made the first ever trip with them to Jersey 40 years ago.
That flight, we can reveal, set off from Wolverhampton.
It landed in a land then untouched by Bergerac via Derbyshire and Birmingham to clear customs.
Now the UK's second largest airline, flies thousands of holiday makers to Jersey and one of their eight airports is, of course, here in Liverpool.
Says spokesman Alan James: ‘We would like to hear from anyone with memories of flying to Jersey in those early days.’

Workers toast Leyland Daf deal
By Stephen Guy Daily Post Correspondent
THE management buy-out of the former Leyland Daf truck manufacturing plant in Lancashire was completed yesterday after last-minute negotiations throughout the night.
Workers toasted news of the deal with free beer at a shop floor meeting in the huge plant yesterday afternoon.
They were told by John Gilchrist, the new chief executive of the revamped company Leyland Trucks Manufacturing Limited: ‘Day after day we will have to rebuild our volume and productivity levels.’
And there was a simultaneous announcement that a business park on land next to the 13-year-old assembly plant would be developed.
Yesterday's announcement followed weeks of uncertainty over the future of the plant, which employs 700 people.
The agreement was signed yesterday morning after the company had been in receivership for exactly 18 weeks.
Mr Gilchrist, 52, formerly joint managing director of Leyland Daf, told a news conference: ‘In the last 24 hours alone more than 30 legal contracts have been finalised and signed.’
He predicted that in its first year the company would have a turnover of about £140m.
John Talbot, of receivers Arthur Andersen, told the news conference: ‘Everyone was working through the night to complete the transaction.’
Louise Ellman, leader of Lancashire County Council, yesterday simultaneously launched a £30m development blueprint.
Land adjacent to the site would be developed as the Lancashire Enterprises Business and Technology Park.
A key part of the agreement with the receiver was the purchase by Lancashire Enterprises of the entire 230-acre site.
The 800,000 square foot plant is being leased back to the management team.

Lego clears first hurdle
A THEME park on the former Windsor Safari Park site has cleared the first planning hurdle.
The £65m park is to be developed by toy building brick company Lego whose UK retail and marketing headquarters is at Wrexham.
The planning board of the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead have approved the scheme in principle and outline planning consent will be sought later in the year.
Some 40 acres of the 147 acre park is to be developed into the new Lego World, a blend of education, entertainment, fantasy and child-sized reality.
The heart of the park will feature models made entirely of Lego bricks depicting scenes and world famous architectural sites.
Over 500 full and part-time jobs will be created.
Trade gap is still a major problem
By Andrew Stevens Business Correspondent
THE first glimpse of Britain's trading position with the rest of the world this year shows that the trade gap remains broadly stable.
Provisional figures published by the Central Statistical Office yesterday showed the deficit for the three months to the end of March was £4.5bn compared with £4.35bn the previous quarter.
The figures are bang in line with City expectations but still show Britain's trade gap remains a problem for the Government.
Yesterday's figures are the first to include statistics on trade with the EC since the single market came into force at the start of the year.
Over the past six months statistics have been gathered by a new Europe-wide service but have not been published until yesterday.
Both imports and exports were shown to be growing at a similar rate.
Export values rose 7pc to £29.6bn while imports were up 6.5pc to £34.1bn.
The underlying picture, which excludes oil and erratic items such as aircraft parts and precious stones, told broadly the same story exports were up 5.2pc to £25.7bn and imports climbed 5pc to £30.9bn.
Statisticians warned that the figures, published as part of the CSO's policy of providing economic statistics as quickly as possible, could be subject to greater revision than usual.
The trade deficit with countries outside the EC grew marginally to £3.4bn while the gap with the EC narrowed to £1.1bn from £1.12bn.
The Government has forecast a year in deficit of £17.5bn, after the £12bn shortfall in 1992.
Yesterday's statistics suggest the trade gap will be slightly bigger than expected this year, mainly due to recession among some of Britain's key trading partners, notably Germany.
Exports and imports measured by both value and volume were at record levels, prompting an optimistic response from the Treasury.
‘UK businesses now have a great opportunity in markets both at home and abroad, thanks not just to pound's depreciation but to their own efficiency gains,’ said a spokesman.
The City also reacted positively to the news with the pound edging ahead after relief that Britain's trade position had not deteriorated with the EC.
But analysts warned that troubles were still brewing for the trade position as the UK maintains its deficit despite the longest recession since 1945.
‘You have to wonder what will happen to the trade position when growth really starts to take hold,’ said Nigel Richardson, economist with finance house Yamaichi International.
Norman Willis, general secretary of the TUC, said the trade figures showed that imports were continuing to rise faster than export growth.
‘Industry has not responded to the new opportunities provided by the devaluation of sterling.
Firms have not boosted their exports as they could have done but have simply increased their profit margins on existing sales.’

Jet job fears spark demand for talks
By Carl Butler Daily Post Staff
PLANE makers at Broughton want an urgent meeting with their new American owners to seek assurances that production will continue in Clwyd.
Loss of skilled jobs at Broughton would be unthinkable, say unions.
Corporate Jets, the former British Aerospace subsidiary which makes the best-selling 125 business jet, has been sold to American company Raytheon for £250m.
Much of the finishing work has already transferred to Corporate Jet headquarters in Little Rock, Arkansas, and 269 redundancies have already been agreed for Broughton, causing workers to be worried about their long-term future.
Yesterday the joint shop stewards committee at Corporate Jets said the loss of production would be a mortal blow.
In a statement the committee says: ‘The loss of world leading aircraft production and highly-skilled jobs here at Broughton is unthinkable.’
Senior stewards are angry the American company has not commented about speculation that loss of production could put 600 Corporate jobs at risk and 300 who are employed by BAe in the main factory, making wings and fuselage parts for the 125.
Shop stewards at Broughton have written to Raytheon's president Max Bleck to ask him to meet them.
Jimmy Spriggs, senior steward for the engineers and electricians union, AEEU, said: ‘We want urgent talks with Mr Bleck.’
Move will create 35 new jobs
By David Hope
THIRTY-FIVE new jobs will be created as a result of a £1m investment in new factory premises by a Southport firm.
Lancashire Steel Fabrication, which produces and treats components for buses and commercial vehicles, moves into the town's former Kinnings factory on Monday with a commitment to increase their 80 strong work force.
Commercial director John Roberts, son of company chairman John C H Roberts, said: ‘Despite the recession, we have expanded by 30pc over the last two years and we are confident of further expansion.’
Around £850,000 has been invested in the latest equipment, by LSF, which has an annual turnover of £4m.
The family-owned firm has its head office in Sefton Street and existing production facilities nearby.
The company, established 25 years ago, received a £120,000 grant from the Department of Trade and Industry to help finance the new investment.
LRF has earned a reputation for expertise and innovation in engineering.

PRESIDENTS past and present of the Building Employers Confederation celebrated the Liverpool region's 125th anniversary yesterday.
The national organisation, which represents the whole of the building industry, started in 1866 when it held its initial meeting in the Durham Ox public house in Brownlow Hill.
The BEC now occupies its own offices around the corner in Hope Street.
The anniversary event was held at the city's Artists Club where immediate past president of the Liverpool region, Brian Hill, reminded everyone of the heritage given to the building industry by the city.
