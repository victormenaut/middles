cos he's coming down
Are you doing it as well.
Yeah
.
You other people and you've obviously got time to start preparing your thoughts.
Yes.
Alright.
take .
Well know it's it's there all the time.
We were just carrying on.
.
.
Right .
.
So what I did with you last week  
 
I said erm but  It is a good start really,someone else  .
.
Sh.
Can you say that again?
Tony he pretends to be someone else in  this  and er more  .
alright .
Yeah..
Alright.
More  Solomon .
Solomons.
Solomons yeah..
Is that  chap as well.
.
.
And and what is the point of disguising  disguise?
Well it means just taking apart.
in terms of any length, what's it doing to the plot for a start.
Well when Tony pretends it sort of gets the ball rolling.
So it's a kind of plot
Yeah.
.
You've got  haven't you?
Yeah.
.
.
erm why Marlowe and he thinks that the family and servants
So .
Yes .
.
Not making  really.
I suppose it's the set up .
O K that's fairly basic stuff  you've got people .
Relationships.
You've got relationships, yes.
Alison  say about previous ideas, what's that.
You're quite sure.
You've got unknown disguises
How do you mean unknown disguises?
Well Marlowe doesn't know who Mister Hardcastle is and doesn't know who Miss Hardcastle is 
Right.
So he is the victim?
Yeah.
Is he?
He's unaware of everything that's going on.
is that right, what's Marlowe's role in all of this
.
Well it's just like that the joke kinda on him because he's erm, he's the one they're all concealing the identity of the house
Even his best friend?
Yeah and erm yeah, he's  keep up the joke.
Right.
They don't want it to interfere with their plans
Erm does this question diary  it all?he look like .
Because erm  it's all the plot can be seen by the audience.
It's not exactly what's gonna happen in the plot we all know what happens it's like how it will happen
romantic outcome or what
Erm well we all know what's going to happen and they sort of give an idea of the plot but it's only Marlowe who doesn't know.
so we know more than the characters do
Yes, or that character does
Yeah.
So we're all in kind of conspiracy and everyone else except Marlowe is that right?
Yes.
Marlowe perhaps figures in other ways as well doesn't he?
.
.
I er it's just that we, all of us are on different pages.
.
Oh yeah.
.
It's more emotional .
It's not really erm intentional this guy .
Yes she puts it on.
Well it's sort of 
.
she finds it  easier to talk to  come out with it..
Yes.
It's not deliberate though is it?
No, it's just that erm he feels comfortable and doesn't have to put on a show
O K.
more erm abrupt more familiar side of him coming out 
Isn't that a little bit pathetic?
Yeah.
He can only be himself with a female inferior.
.
No we ought to .


.
No like that's not it to go with their mates .
I suppose that's true.
There's all  being themselves.
You just said that Englishmen prefer being with other men.
.
I suppose it can be the same I think it's just a bit more extreme like the characteristic he shows when he's in female company like erm just like going over the top the way he acts
.
So there isn't any truth  all of this
Yeah.
O K so if any of you could make  because it's one more interesting psychological ploys in the play, there aren't very many of them are there?comedy I suppose I'll play  behaviour.
Willis  erm  something to that class  isn't it and and what you have classed as having more mileage .
Francesca what do you think?
No .
Whatever .
Lots of  concerning 
It's really exag it's really exaggerated, they really make erm, I can make all the country folk showed as real louts most of  the people in the pub Tony and then the servants are really stupid and then
They're not real butlers they're being trained
Yeah, they're just like farmhands
Yeah  well I've got to be erm
But even like erm Mr and Mrs , like they come over as just comic figures really.
Because Mrs  like erm sort of assumes herself to be really fashionable by the things that  like up with the fashions or anything and then Mr   self important  stories of the War .
Yes.
disguise  .
I was going to actually ask the same question.
Erm you  haven't you?
believe in .
Self delusion..
.
what I said .
.
What about erm, we haven't read any  today, have we?
Erm there's a coach ride.
Oh yeah and it is totally .
.
Yeah.
She doesn't recognise the
Yes.
Mrs  .
This is when disbelief actually suspended  later.
Do you see the performance of it?
Yeah.
Does that get round the problem?
What .
Mm.
Well I suppose it was a bit far fetched.
I don't like the  and everything .
People were coming in and out the shadows, like telling his mum to cuddle up to  to go  everything.
That was a bit far fetched I suppose but erm you won't be looking at it for  it is believable or not .
.
It was just quite funny.
So it's dramatic inventions 
Yeah .
I think so, that feeling for  highwayman.
Erm have people coming on and off stage when they want  sides.
I think.
What you've got to do then is to relate erm, this particular topic to, shall we say themes, and techniques in the play itself.
and also this happened in Shakespeare's plays too.
Erm what it reveals of people psychologically, if anything.
It is not a very profound play  Francesca, anything else you wanted to throw in that we've not included here?
Erm 
that's not all.
could you do the servants .
You mean the serving men
Yeah.
They were sort of weren't they.
In what 
.
.
No they've sort of working on the farm
They're just labourers.
Yeah.
Erm because in fact quite funny seeing they're all being  er to laugh  erm see what  servants in.
That links up as farce again, doesn't it?
Mm.
and dramatic erm action
And erm what Mrs   and what it actually .
Yeah I see .
Kate Hardcastle and Tony.
No Mrs .
Oh right.
But I don't  disguise.
What about the two pairs of children.
What about Mr  and Kate?
She seems fairly true to her father sees this through her .
Perfection.
Yeah, but she's more settled in.
No, yeah .
Well sh 
She's not really better is she?
Yeah well she does actually erm say to everyone in a rather creepy way that  require  do doesn't she?
Help him to quote
it's more obvious to the audience how, like, Tony's just after what he can get sort of thing.
Complete write off.
Yeah.
parents with their siblings that 
How will that be described though?
Yeah.
Well he's  that .


Yeah but  it's what she's perceiving really isn't it?
Yeah.
What she's deluding herself to think
Didn't he help with that illusion?
Not really.
I don't think he really tries to hide the fact that he's like
that he steals her money.
Yeah
to go down to the pub
Yeah he doesn't really try to impress her he makes things worse I think
O K so she's a doting mother, is that right?what  want.
Erm I still want to bring Kate and her father as well I think cos he's looking at  some people, isn't he?
Know what I mean?
Mm.
That should be .
agree.
Well it's your essay not mine but
.
.
Erm what about when Mrs Hardcastle doesn't want to give up the jewels.
Yes  he's rude .
She conceals Tony's age cos he's really twenty one
.
Just those  keep like the jewels in their family .
.
That would do nicely, wouldn't it?
Erm, she also lies about er
thing lost.
in the windows discarded..
Mm.
That was seen ..
Only about Miss  and Hastings.
Yeah.
Have you read, have you looked in that?
.
mention that .
Well I think  not so much  about  when Hastings was there.
Miss  and Tony you have to kinda pretend that they do like each other so that erm the mother doesn't suspect her of liking Hastings.
Mm.
So that's more, shall we say, purposeful, disguising her feelings.
more cunning stuff going on here as well.
Is that right?
Mm.
yeah.
Would you say much more farcical 
Yeah.
theatrical.
Yeah and Hastings and the .
Yes and those two are the least kind of losing .
Mm.
This is the essay you are actually going to write.
Yeah..
maybe
maybe not sure but you're not certain
No, well we've done a little bit.
There's obviously not very much here but I mean
Would you  themes ?
Would I write?
take  take  emotional  and discuss it .
Alright so you are going to judge the characters of the 
.
I wouldn't think I'd discuss it under functions really 
.
See perhaps I'd like to  more section  to.
What the disguise is doing.
Whether it's just a plot
Mm.
erm device or whether it's telling us something about human beings.
.
It would be up to you really  to  common purposes.
Well that's a start isn't it?
Shall we move that one round?girls  please.
Round yourselves up..
.
.
.
What's the actual title
She stoops to conquer and discuss the ways in which women are portrayed in the play.
Portrayed .
.
O K then.
to Miss  came .
So Miss  pays with compliments.
That's clear Miss  is .
.
Oh I'm sorry.
Er
anyway  .
.
But you could mention these  er women that Mrs  talks about .
Mrs  and all these other kind of er interesting offstage characters.
Erm when there's people  every minute he goes, is that  makes out.
No.
Mrs  mentions that when she's talking about sophisticated London
Her friends.
They visit London but she doesn't
Alright fine you might if you're desperate mention that .
You could say that erm Mrs  likes it with  the local .
You know  in love with him.
Yes and at the end of the play as well.
Yeah.
Erm what you have to avoid is just divide into three?
Do you agree with  that would be rather dull she did that.
It would be rather dull.
.
plans .
Oh well if you really want to you can.
It you just look very very well 
.
trip and if you're not going to divide it into three.
Well as Dennis was implying, erm you're really looking say at the low comedy.
Mrs  came to .
put into themes
Well that will seem to me to be a bit more  but obviously it's up to you but it may not quite work out as neatly as  erm  but you may well like to think about the role of women as perceived, the way they treat men and relationships.
So you could do more under that heading couldn't you?
portrayal of women
Yes but like the  are just planning to  affection  based on mutual whatever it is
they base  Mrs  as the villain of the peace.
 
Yeah I thought that  about it
.
she just seemed kind of old fashioned.
to say that erm  erm  they are saying that erm she's most funny and things like that and she's got great depth.
great depth
So th the  comes on a bit heavy at times doesn't it?
Yeah.
And makes a great meal of that material.
She's a villain of the peace.
Well I think you need to go look at  that.
.
Erm er we'll look it up sometime  erm  affection with Tony.
Yeah,?.
which makes her a villain
no makes her not as bad
oh
First of all they said she was the villain.
Then they went on to say why she .
She keeps repeating  .
.
Well because she wants the jewels that's why she's she's sort of like er 
.
She's only interest .
She she's obscuring the truth a bit isn't she?
totally within .
and that's the name.
.
.
and her  as well.
.
she's famous 
.
Oh I see, yes and she wants to go to make out that she's er  whatever age she is.
Yeah, yeah.
and she wants to get Tony and Constance together 
.
really  really that good .
Makes her.
Yes she's  isn't she?
.
she comes out of the bush and says  she wants a highwayman to take her.
Isn't that rather heroic?
Yeah.
That's it  in there .
There's like two sides to it.
I think you're all being a bit heavy with all of this  as treating her like a George Eliot heroine.
Erm  she's obviously got quite a lot of material for anybody to look at.
Erm, what about the fact that she does want to er keep her looks and be fashionable then doesn't she?
The girls to say  about women in particular.
Doesn't that sort of bring in  to the country and  she's out in the country and she wants to show it to them that she she's sort of she's still fashionable .
Yeah, she's a .
. Erm  suggest that  appear fashionable.
You'll find the equivalent  as well.
I thought  just  we can see that she's quite an extremist just .
.
You want to discuss caricature don't you
Well I don't think it's just the real  in fashion  what they're gonna wear  it's only really Mr  that is not interested in it
This person that's kind of bows and his bald head pops out of his wig or something.
Yeah.
Alright
.
Erm.
Mr   Mrs   different roles to Mr Hardcastle
Different role
roles  like Mrs  is interested in fashion  he's not and then  to say  to wear her housecoats and then erm  her  different to what 
Yeah she only wants 
Erm  the subjects now then  to Mr 
I think so.
different values .
.
Erm different values.
O K. It seems to me that  and just  looking at human nature  something  is that right?
And holding them up for a little bit of erm laughter.
So Mrs  so far has been hogging the whole show, is that right?
he's  like Mrs   cos they've got power really over the men 
the men
Yeah
Have they  when  says that he's willing to pay for erm Mrs   disguises the maid, he says he's willing to pay for her services.
Yes.
What's the point you're making there
Like showing their view, really .
He's degrading himself really because he needs to find out that she was  
.
yes, she's really Mrs .
She's the same person but he treats her
Yes
degrading him.
I think so and that's a fairly I mean it's not gonna be heavy moral point here is it but while it shows up   you can treat a woman as an object in this way  don't you think?
will we be able to bring that into the essay
Well if you want to  a woman as a sexual object .
this letter from  erm that  it kind of shows up .
.
Well because  I  she's the conqueror kind of 
Yes
.
she's the butt of the jokes .
Yeah and and if  and I also  what I was going to say how she she kind of is able to control erm  or bring out  because she's  bring out both his sides but erm to her father wants to  sort of get rid of him, she's able to erm  just erm act more charming and get them, you know, one line to prove them wrong.
both sides of his character.
She's  his person, she  both.
She's not really, I don't think she's stupid cos she 's she decides to do it because she's  again.
So she's manipulating.
Yeah she's in control of the whole situation 
.
She's power.
with her father as well.
Yeah.
I see O K that all sounds fine what about their comic roles.
Have you discussed this I suppose we have.
This kind of comic role.
I mean putting on  .
.
Yes, erm, Richard what about Constance?
Well she's like, really she's just like a friend of Kate Hardcastle cos 
she's a woman.
Yeah.
She hasn't got any comedy in her, she's quite serious  it's the home  her say in the prologue  different mentality.
Yes.
Her and Hastings.
Yes.
Her virtue is not virtue if she tumbles 
You're saying that erm Constance is the voice of what, high morals or really she 's 
Not really because she wants, doesn't want to elope with him, she wants her jewels.
So she's quite scheming and erm, would you say money grabbing character?
Erm   .
They aren't her jewels after all .
Just shows you what her priorities are really  rather than handsome man she'd rather have her jewels.
Well have the jewels as well as a handsome man.
Yes .
.
that's a nice little comment on human nature, isn't it?.
But she's she's she doesn't want it she didn't want the jewels did she but when she nearly had them.
 
Yeah .
Erm so if they  this kind of erm poking fun at previous  acquired affection.
Erm discussing why Alexander  is, I think he has to be a bit harsh or satirical as erm.
Erm  Constance  that she she's simply a sentimental heroine.
I think she's quite powerful as well.
Do you?
Because erm in her her differences in her erm behaviour towards Hastings towards Tony, like she's she chases him off the stage  one point  Tony and then she  sort of turn round and be all charming sort of .
.
Yeah, towards Hastings and that shows  they give their two descriptions of her and Tony's  Hastings  they find have beautiful and they find her modest.
That is what shows the two sides to her character.
two different men as well.
.
That's quite a nice point then isn't it?
She seems quite a complicated player in some ways
mm
There's quite a lot to talk about isn't there?
We are still not sure how it's erm  structural .
How to organise it.
Yes we turn to you.
talk about  talk about comedy and all that .
Different levels of comedy is where they actually break it up a bit which erm
Yeah.
comedy  the comedy of the situation  language certain elements of wit or  talking about the farmhouse language, farmyard.
Then you talk about erm how how the characters  that Constance and Kate have different sides  and then you can sort of.
because they are both the same age aren't they? they're both you know, young women aren't they of marriageable age and have rather different functions.
sort of, sort of  material.
Just a bit the men and what  shown through them.
Yes do we have much idea of men's perception of women in the play.
Yes.
Very strong.
and erm
So what is Tony's perception of women?
Don't know .
.
set about  it's an idea or
.
women .
O K that's quite good.
They get so in other words men
.
have quite a rough deal  on .
It shows  doesn't it?you may want to discuss her too
Yes.
as a role model  Er and what about the er marital relation of the Hardcastles  would you want to comment on them?
Well we never really see much of them together except 
Erm
and then again at the end.
They all come .
.
I suppose he's got a bit of power  her at the end because he makes her give the jewels back .
But it's a happy marriage, isn't it? and doesn't this fit in under the idea of sentimentality again.
fit in with the portrayal  because
Erm well insofar as he's fond of his wife  and what their marriage is based on  she's half the marriage isn't she  despite .
.
You've got to make it  the beginning and the end see what comes up  looked it up or anything, thought erm  he's showing her what the younger generation, you know, are erm treating each other isn't he in a romantic way erm there's not much romantic practice in the older generation is there, a bit more affection based on intimate knowledge of each other that sort of thing.
I know  very happy with them.
first reject it reject it.
.
one about .
That one.
Change the  slightly.
conquer erm she stoops to conquer and that implies, doesn't it that women win through devious means
I  putting in like  herself.
Seemingly so.
I don't think she did because she made a choice to be next to, she wanted to find out .
So she 
She did it by herself more than anything.
he's the one being humiliated not her
Yeah.
not her.
Erm it says in the  episode anyway  disguise of Kate Hardcastle .
would you like to add anything or shall we stop there?
.
Are you all actually all doing this essay, are you?
Yeah.
I think it's quite interesting.
I was gonna say about she stoops to conquer  she's also doing what's best because sh she  like, knows what she wants and  like that, erm and she's trying to stop her father from getting him chucked out and stuff as well.
Yes.
She kept saying
So sort of she's yeah, she's sort of sensible and she's tactful as well, she's being tactful by
diplomatic rather than strident and wanting her own way and doing it in a very obvious way.
I suppose you're right,
she sort of er avoiding a lot of erm friction
we're going to do this anyway is a  way through indirectly rather than confrontational which might be a male aggressive sort of  behaviour.
work out the things she does  if she didn't like  quite funny.
she was going to win either way.
She  at the end as well by mentioning what he said to her as a maid.
she again sort of chased  through to  had a rerun of the thing and the truth was revealed.
Fine, well I am sure it would make quite a good essay.
I am quite in agreement with that.
Could we leave that one there and .
Does anyone else want to er come and have a chat, how about a .
.
Beg your pardon.
.
hard.
So 
.
Yeah.
an actual .
.
Did you say
I probably made it up
Did you say she stoops to conquer  the play about the  is an  which I agree.
the function of disguises and deception in  .
.
that be  as white as .
.
.
Yeah.
money, power and sex, violence .
Right  kick us off will you
O K erm.
So what number is this?
Number nine.
Right.
Right erm  function of disguise and perception  class distinctions  the money  to  sort of how she feels  sort of like well bred  educated
That's nice  .
.
.
Right so  they are
Although it's  that are .
Really stupid  they can't behave 
Right.
meant to and that is healthy  stand there .
So to get the point of this so  sometimes servants are the butt of humour in the play
Yeah.
then the when they're all parading around it's  to behave, he tried to hold their hands, right.
Erm the way that the so-called high class types treat them  in a way showing up the high classes as well is that right?
Yeah.
O K .
was the servant  as though.
Probably servants are thick, that's .
and   had control over Mrs  with his  stupid maid, whereas it's sort of reversed, cos she has power over him cos she brings out  character .
.
is quite easy  it.
Giving her a second chance he having failed 
Yeah, but he feels that he's the one  
broadly
.
I don't believe that, erm that they could bring out that statement  goes kind of.
.
.
That sounds quite nice.
Erm
.
So we're looking to  there aren't we  only relate to inferior women.
Er is that  truthful do you think human nature .
behave  think of them as less than  have to  doesn't it  
.
People as a threat 
.
Yeah  .
No but erm socially  
.
Alright that sounds very very reasonable 
.
.
It was the way he was erm  as well  out of his way to impress them  so but they just, well you  might help 
So it's a kind of competition between them 
.
trying to show you Sir  trying to .
.
Right so listen, what about down  relating to your social position  other words you you gain credibility from who you as opposed to what you are 
.
Yeah .
.
amount of money you have and that sort of thing  .
.
Right I think you could bring it, this out  sociological  this to you 
.
You won't actually look at the fact that there's a competition going on between the  erm  dismissing that you are actually   the new keeper  
.
ages to get into  
.
Right so  
.
If you'd like to just hang on a second I want to  this little .
 
Erm 
.
.
.
meet Miss   
.
so just  the book on  she  putting forward and  that right 
.
Yeah 
 
O K erm .
What are the jewels  .
.
Erm, yeah  Mrs  she sort of has the power over  level  erm  if she  she sort of, it's like she's sort of keeping her on this level in the same household as her  
.
Yeah 
.
They're not really  they're really .
She wants to keep them  down  .
.
Yeah .
.
We have  going on between them  
.
the house 
.
tradition  .
.
Yeah tradition yeah 
.
.
.
traditional sort of  concentrates on  .
.
he  .
.
I can't really  certain  
.
That's  against  .
.
O K  
.
Erm  
.
You haven't got any  smaller .
 
.
.
that's all  .
 
About quarter to twelve 
.
.
.
then 
.
See how you're fixed  I'll be there anyway,
.
Yeah .
.
don't worry .
.
Sir 
.
