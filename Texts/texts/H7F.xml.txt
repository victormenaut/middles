THEOBALD'S ROAD
He walked through the white corridors, past the notice boards with their offers of small rooms and old cars, past the coffee bar where people sat at tables, past a hole in the white floor where an old chair stood sentry over an opened conduit in which a torch shone and a man crawled, and as he left he looked at his watch:
TU 28 pm 3:33
He stood on the steps for a second, smiling at the figures on the face of the watch.
Three three three.
A good omen.
Today was a day things would come together, a day events would coalesce.
It was bright outside, even after the painted lightness of the marble-flaked corridor.
The air was warm, slightly humid but not sultry.
The walk would be a pleasure today.
Mat was good too, because he didn't want to arrive at her place hot and flustered; not today, not with her at the end of the walk, not with that subtle but unequivocal promise there, waiting, ready.
Graham Park stepped out on to the broad grey pavement outside the School and during a break in the traffic jogged across Theobald's Road to its north side.
He relaxed to a walk on the pavement outside the White Hart pub, his large black portfolio held easily at his side by its single handle.
Drawings of her.
He looked up at the sky, above the blocks and squat towers of the  medium-rise office blocks, and smiled at its blue, city-grimed segmentings.
Everything seemed fresher, brighter, more real today, as though all his quite normal, perfectly standard surroundings had until this point been actors fumbling behind some thin stage curtain, struggling to get out, but now stood, triumphant expression frozen on face, hands spread, going "Ta-Raah!" on the boards at last.
He found this young-love rapture almost embarrassing in its intensity; it was something he was delighted to have, determined to hide, and wary of examining.
It was enough to know it was there, and the very commonness of it was reassuring in a way.
Let others have felt this way, let them feel it now; it would never be exactly like this, never be identical.
Revel in it, he thought, why not?
A worn and grubby old man stood with his back against the wall of another tall grey-and-brick red building.
He wore a heavy grey-green coat, even in that heat, and one of his shoes was open at the toe, baring skin inside.
He held two huge boxes of mushrooms.
It was the sort of sight —the poor, the strange —which usually alarmed Graham.
So many strange people in London.
So many of the poor and the decrepit, the still spinning shrapnel, walking wounded of society.
Usually they oppressed and threatened him, these people with little threat to offer, and much to fear.
But not today; today the old man.
hot in his thick coat, blinking from his grey face, clammy hands round his two two-pound boxes of mushrooms was merely interesting, just a possible subject for a drawing.
He passed the Post Office, where a young black man, tall and well dressed, stood talking quietly to himself.
Again no fear.
He realised that maybe he really was after all, just a little, the country hick he had tried so hard to avoid being.
He had been so determined to be ungullible, city-wise that perhaps he had gone too far in the other direction, and so read a threat in everything the big city had to offer.
Only now, with the promise of the strength she might give him, could he afford the luxury of thinking so closely about himself (you had to have armour in the city, you had to know where you stood).
He had opted for the cynical, guarded approach, and now he could see that for all the safety it had brought him —here he was, in his second year, still solvent, heart intact, unmugged and even succeeding in his studies, despite all his mother's fears —every defence had its price, and he had paid in a separating distance, incomprehension.
Perhaps the young black man was not mad; people did talk to themselves.
Perhaps the old man with the torn shoe was not some desperate down-and-out with fists full of stolen mushrooms; maybe he was just an ordinary person whose shoes had split that lunchtime, while shopping.
He looked at the traffic roaring by, and over it through railings at the leafy greenness of Gray's Inn, edging into view on his right.
He would remember this day, this walk.
Even if she did not…even if all his dreams, his hopes did not…ah, but they would.
He could feel it.
 "Put that fantasy down, Park, you don't know where it's been." 
He turned quickly to the voice and there was Slater, bounding down the steps of Holborn Library, wearing a pair of one-and-a-half-legged jeans, with a shiny black shoe on one foot and a knee-length boot on the other; the jeans were cut to suit, so that one leg ended normally, in a stitched hem over the shoe, while the other leg came to a frayed stop just above the top of the boot.
Above, Slater sported a well-worn hacking jacket over a black shirt and a black bow tie which appeared to have lots of small, dull red stones set in it.
On his head sat a tartan cap, predominantly red.
Graham looked at his friend and laughed.
Slater responded with a look of pretended chilliness.
 "I see nothing to cause such hilarity." 
 "You look like —" Graham shook his head and waved one hand at Slater's jeans and footwear, and spared a glance for his cap.
 "What I look like," Slater said, coming forward and taking Graham by the elbow to continue walking, "is somebody who has discovered an old pair of RAF pilot's boots at a market stall in Camden." 
 "And taken a knife to them," Graham said, looking down at Slater's legs and shrugging his arm free of the light grip which held it.
Slater smiled, put his hands in the pockets of his mutilated jeans.
"There you show your ignorance, young man.
If you had looked carefully, or if you knew enough, you would appreciate that these are, in fact, specially designed pilot's boots which, with the aid of a couple of zips, convert into what was doubtless, in the forties, a pretty neat-looking pair of shoes.
The whole point is that if the intrepid aviator got shot down while blasting Gerry out of the skies above enemy territory, he could simply unzip his boot-legs and have a pair of civilian-looking shoes on his feet, and thus pass for a native and so escape those dreadful SS men in their tight little black uniforms.
I have merely adapted—’ "You look silly," Graham interrupted.
 "Why you straight old straight" Slater said.
They were walking slowly now; Slater never liked to rush.
Graham was only a little impatient, and he knew better than to try to hurry Slater up.
He had left in plenty of time, there was no hurry.
More time to savour.
 "I just don't know why you turn me on at all," Slater said, then peered closely at the other young man's face and said pointedly, "Are you listening to me, Park?" 
Graham shook his head, grinning slightly, but said,"Yes, I'm listening.
You don't have to camp it up with me."
 "Oh my God, pardon me," Slater said melodramatically, one hand fanned over his upper chest,"I'm offending the poor hetero boy.
Under twenty-one as well; oh say it ain't so!"
 "You're a fraud, Richard," Graham said, turning to look at his friend.
"I sometimes think you aren't even gay at all.
Anyway."
he went on, attempting to increase their pace a little,"what have you been up to ?
I haven't seen you around for a couple of days."
 "Ah, the change-of-subject," Slater laughed, staring ahead.
He grimaced and scratched his short, curly black hair where it stuck out from under his tartan cap.
His thin, pale face contorted as he said,"Well, I shan't go into the seamy details…the more basic facets of life, but on a cleaner if more frustrating theme, I have been trying to seduce that lovely Dickson boy over the last week.
You know: the one with the shoulders."
 "What," Graham said contemptuously, annoyed,"that tall bloke with the bleached hair in first year?
He's thick."
 "Hmm, well," Slater said, bobbing his head in an arc —a gesture somewhere between a nod and a shake —"thick set, certainly, and not ally bright, but God those shoulders.
That waist, those hips!
I don't care about his head; from the neck down he's a genius."
 "Idiot," said Graham.
 "Trouble is," Slater mused,"he either doesn't realise what I'm up to, or he doesn't care.
And he has this awful friend, called Claude."
I keep telling him how earthy I think he is, but he hasn't got it yet.
Now he really is thick.
I asked him what he thought of Magritte the other day, and he thought I was talking about some girl in first year.
And I can't get him away from Roger.
I shall die if he's gay.
I mean if he got there first.
I'm sure Roger isn't really stupid, it's just his friend who's infectious.
 "Ha ha," Graham said.
He always felt slightly uncomfortable  when Slater talked about being gay, though his friend was rarely specific.
and Graham was hardly ever directly involved —he had, for example, only ever met one of Slater's (supposedly many) lovers, at least as far as he knew.
 "Do you know." 
Slater said, suddenly brightening, as they crossed John Street.
 "I've had this really good idea." 
Graham gritted his teeth: "Well, what is it this time?
Another new religion, or just a way of making lots of money?
Or both?"
 "This is a literary idea." 
"If it's The Sands of Love.
I've already heard it"
"That was a great plot.
No, it isn't romantic fiction this time."
They stopped at the comer of Gray's Inn Road, waiting for the lights to change.
A couple of punks on the far side, also waiting to cross, were pointing at the oblivious Slater and laughing.
Graham looked up at the skies and sighed.
"Imagine.
if you will, "slater said dramatically, sweeping his arms out wide," a"
 "Keep it short," Graham told him.
Slater looked hurt.
 "It's a sort of Byzantine future, a degenerate technocratic empire with" 
 "Oh, not science fiction again." 
 "Well, no, it's not really, smart-ass," Slater said,"It's a fable.
I could make it a fairy-tale instead, if I wanted to, Anyway, It's the capital of the empire; a courtier starts a liaison with one of the princesses; the demands she and the impersonate on his time get to be too much, so he secretly has an android made to impersonate him at the endless court rituals and boring receptions; nobody notices.
Later he has the android's brain upgraded so it can cope with hunting expeditions and personal meetings, even Cabinet discussions with the Emperor present, all so that he can spend more time dallying with the princess.
But he gets killed in some over-energetic love-play.
The android continues to fulfil all its courtly duties and even becomes a trusted confidant of the Emperor, and the princess discovers it actually makes a better lover than the original.
The android can fit in all its commitments because it never has to sleep.
But it develops a conscience, and has to tell the Emperor the truth.
The Emperor smiles, opens up an inspection panel in his chest and says.
 "Well, by a funny coincidence." 
End of story, petty good, eh?
What do you think?"
Graham took a deep breath, thought, then said,"These pilots: so they could disguise their boots.
What about their uniforms?"
He frowned seriously.
Slater stopped, a look of horror and confusion on his face, "What?" he said, aghast.
Suddenly Graham realised —with a small, disquieting feeling in his stomach —that they were standing right outside a place which always made him feel apprehensive.
It was only a small picture-framing shop which sold prints and posters and more-tasteful-than-average lampshades, but it was the name which held unpleasant associations for Graham: Stocks, That name chilled him.
Stock was his rival, the great threat, the cloud hanging over him and Sara.
Stock the biker, the macho black-leathered never-properly-seen image of Nemesis,(He had looked up the name in the London telephone directory; there were one-and-a-half columns of them; enough for quite a few coincidences, even in a city of six-and-a-half million people.)
Slater was saying, "—to do with it?" 
 "It just occurred to me," Graham said defensively.
He wished now he hadn't decided to tease Slater.
 "You haven't listened to a word I've said," Slater gasped.
Graham nodded to indicate they should keep on walking.
 "Of course I have," he said.
They passed Terry's fruitstall next, with its smell of fresh strawberries, then a chemists.
They were at the junction of Clerkenwell Road and Rosebery Avenue.
By the side of Gray's Inn Buildings, which led on up the Avenue, some tall green wooden hoardings jutted out over part of the street and pavement, shielding some roadworks.
Graham and Slater walked down the narrow alley formed by the seedy, decaying stonework and the painted wood; Graham saw the grimy glass of cracked windows; fading political posters flapped in a slight breeze.
 "But don't you think it's a laugh?" 
Slater said, trying to edge round Graham to peer into his face.
Graham avoided his friend's eyes.
He wondered if Slater intended to walk the whole way with him, or whether he was only going as far as the Air Gallery, now only just across the street, where he sometimes went in the afternoons.
Graham didn't mind Slater knowing about Sara —he had introduced them to each other, after all —but he wanted to keep this day private.
Besides, he got embarrassed at the stares  people gave Slater, even if Slater himself didn't seem to notice.
The least he could do, Graham thought was take off that ridiculous tartan cap.
 "It's all right," he conceded as they came out from between the decaying buildings and the green hoardings, "but…" he smiled and looked at Slater, "don't give up your day job." 
 "And don't you quote my own lines back at me, you young pup!" 
 "Okay," Graham said, looking at Slater again.
 "Stick to ceramics." 
 "You make me sound like a glaze." 
 "That's your expression." 
 "Oh-ho," Slater said.
 "well, touché or toushe, anyway." 
He stopped by the pedestrian crossing which led over Rosebery Avenue to the square, red-brick building of the Air Gallery.
Graham turned to face him.
 "But don't you like the latest scenario?" 
 "Well," Graham said slowly, deciding he had better say something nice, "it's good, but perhaps it needs a little work." 
 "Huh," Slater said, stepping back and rolling his eyes.
He came forward again, eyes narrowed, pushing his face close to Graham's so that the younger man shrank back just a little.
 "" A little work", eh?
Well, bang goes your commission from the National Portrait Gallery when I'm famous."
 "Are you going over there?" 
Graham indicated the far side of the road.
Slater slouched a little and nodded, looking over the road to the gallery.
"I suppose so.
You're trying to get rid of me, aren't you?"
 "No I'm not." 
"Yes you are.
You've been hurrying me all the way."
 "No, I wasn't," Graham protested.
 "It's just that you walk slowly." 
 "I was talking to you." 
 "Well, I can walk and listen at the same time." 
"Oh, wow, the Gerry Ford of the Art School.
Anyway.
not to worry; I bet I know where you're off to hmm?"
 "Oh?" 
Graham said, trying to look innocent.
 "Yes, I can tell," Slater said.
 "Stop trying to look so damn nonchalant." 
A smile appeared on his face like oil surfacing on still water.
 "You've got the hots for our Sara, haven't you?" 
 "Oh, intensely," Graham said, trying to over-play it; but he could see Slater wasn't taken in.
But it wasn't like that; It wasn't that  crude, or even if it was it shouldn't be talked of in such a way; not now, not yet,
 "They aren't worth it, kid." 
Slater said, shaking his head sadly and wisely.
"She'll let you down.
Later if not now.
They always do."
Graham felt happier with this direct assault; this was just gay misogyny, not even genuine at that, but another of Slater's roles.
He laughed and shook his head.
Slater shrugged and said.
 "Well, when it does go wrong, at least you know you can come running to me." 
He patted his right shoulder with his other hand.
 "I have very good shoulders for crying on." 
 "Not." 
Graham laughed,"while you re wearing that cap, chum.
Slater narrowed his eyes and straightened the tartan cap on his head.
 "Well." 
Graham went on hurriedly.
 "I really have to go now, and took a couple of steps backwards." 
 "All right, then." 
Slater sighed wistfully, "Do all the things I wouldn't dream of doing, but don't forget what your Uncle Richard told you." 
He grinned, blew Graham a kiss, waved one hand, then stepped on to the crossing during a lull in the traffic.
Graham waved back, then walked away, "Graham!" 
Slater called suddenly from the other side of the road.
He turned to look.
sighing.
Slater stood outside the gallery, in front of one of its large windows.
He put one hand in his jacket pocket.
and as he did so his bow tie lit up; the small red stones were really lights.
They flicked on and off Slater started laughing as Graham shook his head and walked away up Rosebery Avenue.
 "A quick flash!" slater bellowed in the distance.
Graham laughed to himself, then had to break his stride as a long-haired biker in dirty denims bumped a large Moto Guzzi across the pavement in front of him and into the courtyard entrance of the buildings called Rosebery Square, Graham looked darkly at the man pushing the bike, then shook his head, telling himself not to be so stupid.
The man looked nothing like Stock, the bike was quite different from the big black BMW Stock rode, and anyway omens were nonsense, Stock's time was over; he could tell that from what Sara had said over the phone that morning.
He breathed deeply and put his shoulders back, shifted the large black portfolio from one hand to the other.
What a blue sky!
What a great day!
He thrilled to everything around him.
no matter what; the brightness of the June day, the smell of cheap cooking and exhaust fumes; birds singing, people talking.
Nothing would, nothing could go wrong today; he ought to find a betting shop and put some money on a horse, he felt so lucky, so good, so in tune.
MR SMITH
Lips tight, fists clenched, eyes narrow, breath held, back straight, stomach in, chest out, shoulders back, Steven Grout stamped away from the depot he had just been fired from, away from their stupid job and those awful people.
He came to a car parked by the kerb, stopped, took a deep breath, then walked on.
Never mind the name of the road, he thought; they would only change it.
He watched the cars and buses and vans and trucks pass by him, and calculated how far he had to go to get to the next parked car which would shield him from them.
The pavement had been much repaired, and it was difficult to synchronise his steps so that the middle of each foot fell exactly on the cracks between the paving stones, but with some concentration and a few judicious half-steps he managed it; then he came to a long blue-grey line of asphalt where a pipe had obviously been repaired, and walked along that instead free from the worry of the paving stones between the cracks.
He still felt hot and sticky from the attack by the Microwave Gun.
He thought back, again, to the confrontation in Mr Smith's office.
Of course, he had known they would use the Microwave Gun on him; they always did when he was up in front of somebody, whenever he was at a disadvantage anyway and needed all the help he could get, whenever he was going for an interview for a job, or being asked things by the Social security people or even clerks in the Post Office.
That was when they used it on him.
Sometimes they used it on him when he was waiting to be served by a barman, or even when he was just standing waiting to cross a busy street, but mostly it was when he was talking to somebody official.
He had recognised the symptoms as he was standing in Mr Smith's office.
His palms were sweating, his forehead was wet and itching, he felt shivery, his voice was shaky and his heart was beating fast; they were cooking, him with the Microwave Gun, bathing him in its evil radiations, heating him up so that he broke out in a lathering sweat and looked like a nervous kid.
Bastards!
He'd never found the Gun, of course; they were very clever, very clever and cunning indeed.
He had given up dashing through to adjoining rooms running to look downstairs or above, craning his head out of windows to look for hovering helicopters, but he knew they were there somewhere all right, he knew what they were up to .
So he had to stand there, in the office of the Roadworking Operatives Supervisor in the Islington Council Seven Sisters Road Highways Department Depot, sweating like a pig and wondering why they didn't just get on with it and sack him as he listened to Mr Smith and his eyes hurt and he could smell his own body-odour again.
 "…were all hoping that this would not be a continuing situation, Steve," Mr Smith said, droning nasally from behind the chip-board desk in his low-ceilinged office on the depot's first floor, "and that you would be able to consolidate your position here by forming a positive working relationship with the remainder of the road gang, who, in all fairness, I'm sure you'd be the first to agree, have done their very best to well…" 
Mr Smith, a man of about forty with large soft bags under his eyes, leant over his paper-strewn desk and looked down at the No-Nonsense pen he was fiddling with, Steven watched the pen.
mesmerised for a second.
"I really do think ah Steve -oh, and please don't hesitate to interject if you feel you have anything you wish to articulate; this isn't a star chamber here, I want you to play a full and meaningful part in this discussion If you feel that thereby we can ah, resolve,…
"
What was that?
He wasn't sure he'd heard that right.
Something about a Star Chamber?
What was that?
What did it mean?
It didn't sound like it fitted in with this period, this setting, this age or whatever you wanted to call it.
Could Mr Smith be another Warrior, or even further up the hierarchy of Tormentors than he'd thought?
God!
Those bastards and that Gun He could feel sweat start to gather in the lines of his forehead and in his eyebrows.
Soon it would roll down his nose, and then what?
They might think he was crying!
It was unbearable!
Who didn't they just throw him out?
He knew it was what they wanted to do, what they had planned to do, so why didn't they just do it then?
"…resolve this apparent impasse in some viable way conducive with the efficient operation of the department.
I don't think I'm running a particularly tight ship here, Steve; we like to think that people will appreciate…"
Steven stood smartly to attention in the middle of the office, his hard hat held tightly under his right arm, close to his side.
Out of the corner of his eye he could just see Dan Ashton, the road-gang foreman and union representative.
Ashton was leaning, thick bronzed arms folded, against the edge of the doorway.
He was about fifty, but the fittest as well as the oldest man in the gang; he stood there grinning unpleasantly, his cap pushed back on his head, a damp, unlit roll-up hanging from his mouth.
Grout could detect its soggy odour even over the smell of Mr Smith's Aramis.
Ashton had never liked him either.
None of them did, even the one or two who didn't continually make fun of him and tease him and play jokes on him.
 "…over backwards to accommodate you, but it really does look, I'm afraid, as though this incident with the canal and the cat has to be just about the last straw, ah Steve, I understand from Mr Ashton here —" Smith nodded at the older man, who pursed his lips and nodded back,"— that Mr ah…
"
Mr Smith looked at some of the papers on his desk for a moment,"…ah yes, Mr Partridge had to go to hospital for a tetanus injection and stitches after you struck him with a shovel.
Now, we don't think he's going to press charges, but you must realise that if he did you would in fact be facing a charge of assault, and coming as this does on top of your other verbal and written warnings —all within, I'm  afraid to say, Steve, "Mr Smith sat back in his seat with a sigh and flicked through a few more of the papers on his desk, shaking his head at them," a very short interval of time considering the length of your employment with us, and all regarding previous lapses in…"
Partridge!
He wished he'd knocked his head right off.
Calling him those names!
Bastard, was he?
Mad, was he?
Simple, eh?
That fat Cockney with his stupid tattoos and his jocular manner and his dirty jokes; he should have dumped him in the canal!
The sweat was gathering in his brows, getting ready to slide down his nose and make a dewdrop at the end which would either stay there wobbling about very obviously and making him want to sneeze, or force him to draw attention to it by wiping it away.
To wipe his brow would be a sign of weakness, too though; he wouldn't do it!
Let them see his proud contempt!
They wouldn't break him, oh no!
He wouldn't give them the satisfaction.
"…appreciated what you have said about not really meaning to offend anybody, I just can't square this version of accounts with that of your workmates, Steve, who insist, I'm afraid, that you seemed quite serious about back-filling the canal with the tarmac allocated for laying on Colebrook…ah…
Colebrook Row, in fact.
As for Mrs Morgan's cat, all we can do is"
They were talking about cats, to him!
One of the mightiest warlords in the history of existence, and they were talking about bloody cats!
Oh, how the mighty were fallen, right enough!
The sweat left his right eyebrow.
It didn't roll down his nose; it went straight into his eye instead.
A terrible, furious, impotent anger filled him, making him want to strike out, to shout and scream.
He couldn't do that, though; he had to keep cool, despite the Microwave Gun, and only answer back, if even that, Discipline; that was important.
 "…but I take it you have nothing else to say?" 
Mr Smith said, and stopped talking.
Grout sucked in his breath; was he supposed to say something?
Who didn't people make things clear?
What was the point, though?
Might as well get the whole thing over with as fast as possible.
 "I was only kidding!" he heard himself say.
It had just leaped out!
But it was true; it was only a sign of their stupidity or their fear? —that they were taking him so seriously.
Of course he hadn't been going to fill the bloody canal in!
It would  have taken him all day even if they'd had enough tarmac in the back of the pickup!
It was all just a sort of angry joke because the rest of the gang, and Ashton in particular, wouldn't agree with him about the best way to fill holes in.
But they would see; those holes they'd patched in Upper Street at the start of the morning shift would soon show who was right!
Of course, he knew speaking out would do no good, but he couldn't help it sometimes.
He had to tell people when they were doing things the wrong way.
It was more than he could bear to see the stupidity around him and just suffer it in silence.
That would drive him to madness, to the place they most wanted him, the place in which it would be even more difficult to find the Key; an institution, a hospital where they filled you up with all sorts of disgusting drugs and deliberately kept you as stupid as the rest.
That was part of their game, of course; leave him to search for the way to escape, but alone.
If he started trying to find any others like him, other Warriors, they would have an excuse for locking him away.
It was fiendishly clever.
"…really excuse your actions Steve.
Let's be fair, now; I don't expect it makes much difference to Mrs Morgan, or her cat, "Mr Smith said, and a small smile played over his lips as he glanced at Dan Ashton, who grunted and looked down at his feet while Smith continued," whether you were joking or in deadly seriousness."
The other eyebrow discharged its sweat, rolling it down into Grout's other eye.
He blinked furiously, almost blinded, eyes red and stinging, intolerable!
"…typing your final written warning now, but really, Steve.
without wishing to sound patronising In any way or form.
I really do think you're going to have to mend your ways very considerably indeed if you're to —"
 "Right!" 
Steven shouted hoarsely, shaking his head, sniffing hard and blinking all at the same time,"My contempt for all…all of you is just it!
I resign!
I won't give you the satisfaction!
I quit; I resign; I throw in the towel There.
I've said it before you did!
Don't tell me I couldn't; I'm stronger than you know!"
He could feel his lips trembling; he fought to control them, Mr Smith sighed and leaned forward over his desk.
 "Now, Steve —he began tiredly." 
 "Don't you" Now Steve "me!" 
Grout shouted, standing there  and quivering, "It's" Mr Grout"to you.
I'm resigning; give me my papers!
I demand my papers; where are my papers?"
He stepped forward towards Mr Smith's desk, Smith sat back, surprised, Grout saw him exchange looks with Dan Ashton, and thought he could see the older man nod, or give some sort of sign or signal to Mr Smith.
Certainly the foreman was no longer leaning against the door-jamb; he was standing properly now, arms unfolded.
Maybe he thought Steven was going to offer some violence to Mr Smith; well, let them fear!
He'd show them!
He wasn't frightened of any of them.
 "I really do think you're being a little rash in this —" Mr Smith began, but Steven interrupted,
"I believe I asked for my papers, please!
I shan't leave without my papers.
And my money!
Where are they?
I know my rights!"
 "Steve, I think you're allowing your understandable —" Mr Smith began, pushing his chair back from his desk slightly.
The sunlight glinted on his discreet SDP lapel-badge.
 "Enough!" 
Steven shouted.
He took another step forward, and with his right hand made as though to hit Mr Smith's desk.
His hard hat, held in the crook of his right arm, fell out from between his arm and his side and hit the floor, rolling briefly, Steven stooped quickly and retrieved it, banging his head sharply on the front edge of Mr Smith's desk as he straightened.
He rubbed his head rapidly, feeling his face turning red.
Damn that Gun!
Mr Smith was on his feet now.
Dan Ashton had come forward, and was leaning over from the side of Smith's desk, whispering something into his boss's ear.
Grout glared at them both as he rubbed his smarting head.
Oh, it was easy to see what they were both up to!
 "Well," Mr Smith began, a pained expression on his face as he turned to look at Grout again, "if that's the way you really feel, Steve…" 
Dan Ashton had smiled thinly.
So he'd won in the end.
He hadn't given them the satisfaction of firing him there and then; he'd shown them the contempt he felt for them…let them suffer!
A strange fierce joy had filled him after that, and he hadn't really heard anything Ashton or Smith had said to him.
They'd given him some papers, and somebody had gone to the cashier for his money  (it made a nice fat bulge in his hip pocket; he patted it now and again as he walked, just to make sure it was still there) and eventually he'd signed some papers.
He hadn't wanted to sign anything, but they had said they wouldn't give him any money unless he did, so he'd pretended to read the papers carefully and then signed them.
Ashton had tried to see him out after that, and even wanted to shake hands with him, but Steven had spat at his feet and made a rude sign at him.
 "You bad little fucker," Ashton had said, which was typical of him, Steven had told him he was a foul-mouthed ignoramus, and stuffed his various papers and forms quickly into his trouser pockets and walked off, "Here!" 
Ashton had shouted after him as he strode down Seven Sisters Road, head held high, "Your P45, You dropped it!" 
At least that was what Steven thought he had shouted; it might have been a different number, but it was something like that.
He had glanced back, to see Ashton standing at the depot gates, waving a piece of paper at him.
Grout turned away, straightened his back and brought his head up, ignoring Ashton pointedly as he walked proudly away.
Ashton had started after him; Steven heard his trotting steps behind him; so he ran, ignoring the older man's shouts until eventually he outdistanced him.
Ashton had shouted one last thing at him, but Steven had been too far away, breathing deeply, an expression of triumph on his face, He'd got away from them.
It was a small escape, a little rehearsal, but it was something.
So now he walked, still angry with them, but glad to be away, glad to have salvaged something from yet another of their attempts to grind him down.
make him feel small, drive him into despair.
They wouldn't succeed that easily!
They had surrounded him with horror and stupidity, with all the paraphernalia of this so-called human excess, and they expected it to bring him down, to reduce him still further from the once proud state he had fallen from, but they would not succeed.
They were trying to wear him down, but they would fail; he would find the Key, he would find the Way Out and escape from this joke, this awful solitary confinement for Heroes; he would leave them all behind and take his rightful place in the greater reality again.
He had Fallen, but he would Rise.
There was a war somewhere, He didn't know where.
Not a place  you could necessarily get to by travelling anywhere from here, late Twentieth Century London, Earth, but somewhere, sometime.
It was the ultimate war, the final confrontation between Good and Evil, and he had played a major part in the war.
But something had gone wrong, he had been betrayed, lost a battle with the forces of chaos and been ejected from the real battleground to languish here, in this cesspit they called "life" .
It was part punishment, part test.
He could fall entirely, of course, and be demoted still further, with no hope of escape.
That was what they wanted, the ones who controlled the whole seedy show; the Tormentors.
They seemed to want him to try and call their bluff, to stand up and say: "Right, I know what it's all about, you can drop the pretence.
Come out wherever you are and let's get it over with", but he knew better than that.
He had learned that lesson as a child, when the others had laughed at him, and they sent him to see the school shrink.
He wasn't going to try that again.
He wondered how many people in all the mental hospitals in the country —or the world", —come to that —were really fallen Warriors who had either cracked up from the strain of trying to live in this hell-hole, or simply made the wrong choice and thought that the test was just seeing through the whole thing and then having the courage to stand out and make that challenge.
Well, he wasn't going to end up like one of those poor bastards.
He would see it through, he would find the Way Out, And he might not even stop at simply escaping; he might just smash up the whole foul contraption of their testing and imprisonment apparatus —this "life" —while he was about It.
He was starting to feel faint.
He had about another ten paces to go to the next parked car, within the wheelbase of which he would be safe from the laser-axles of the passing traffic.
All the traffic, every single vehicle which passed him was equipped with lasers in its axles; they could register a hit on his legs unless he was above them, or shielded by a wall, or between the wheels of a parked car, or holding his breath.
Of course, he knew that the lasers didn't hurt; you couldn't see them and they did no harm by themselves, but he knew that they were another of the ways that they —the Tormentors —took points off him.
He knew all this from dreams, and from having worked it out.
As a child he had done the  same thing, as a game; something to make life more interesting, give It some purpose, then he had begun to have dreams about it, to come to realise that it was real, that he had had an insight when he started to play the game, He had to do it now; it felt horrible and uncomfortable when he tried to stop, even just to see what it was like walking down a street breathing "normally" .
It was like the feeling he used to get when he played another game from his childhood; that of closing his eyes and walking for a certain number of steps along, say, a wide path in a park.
No matter how certain he might be immediately before he closed his eyes that there was plenty of space in front of him, no matter how positive he was as he walked with eyes closed that he wasn't veering off to one side and there was tarmac under his feet rather than grass, he still found it very hard, almost impossible, to walk more than about twenty paces with his eyes closed.
He would be certain, positive, that he was about to walk Into a tree, or a post or sign he hadn't noticed; even that somebody had been watching from behind a tree and was about to leap out and punch him hard on the nose.
Better to keep your eyes open; better to trust your instincts and take deep breaths between the parked cars.
You couldn't be too, careful.
He got to the car and stopped opposite it, breathing deeply.
He took off his hard hat and wiped his brow, after checking for scaffolding.
The safety helmet was another of his discoveries, his good ideas.
He knew how vulnerable people's heads were, and how important his own was.
He knew the would just love to arrange a little "accident" with some spanner or brick falling from a building, or, more plausibly still, from some scaffolding.
So he had worn that hard hat, since even before he left the home.
No matter what the job was, or what else he might be doing, he wore the hat when he was outside.
They had laughed at him in the road gang; who did he think he was? they said.
Poncy engineers wore hard hats everywhere, not your labourers.
Or was he frightened of pigeons then?
Going a bit thin on top as well as inside, eh?
Ha ha, Let them laugh.
They wouldn't get the hat off him.
He had two spare hats in his room just in case he ever lost his usual one, or somebody stole it.
People had done that before now, too.
He started walking again, treading carefully on the cracks between the paving stones.
A careful, steady stride was very important, anyway.
Good for the breathing and the heart rate.
People stared at him sometimes, jumping from one paving stone border to another, then taking some mincing little half-steps over others, his face going strange colours as he ran out of stored air in his lungs, sweating under a hard hat with no construction sites anywhere in evidence, but he didn't care.
They'd be sorry, one day.
As he walked, he wondered what he would do today with his new-found freedom.
He had lots of money; perhaps he would get drunk…the pubs would be open soon.
He supposed he ought to go and sign on; let the unemployment people know he was out of a job again.
He wished he could remember what you were supposed to do when you wanted to register as unemployed, but he always forgot.
Obviously the whole unemployment/Social Security system had been set up to confuse, anger and demoralise him.
He kept meaning to take notes, write down all the separate moves you were meant to make, forms fill out, offices visit, people see, but he always forgot.
Anyway, he always told himself that this would be the last time; this time he would find some really good job in which he would get on really well and his talents would be appreciated and people would like him and he would surprise all his Tormentors, so there would be no reason to go through the whole fraught and sapping business of signing on again.
He wondered vaguely about going back to Mrs Short's boarding house and getting a pen and paper.
He would go back to his room.
He always felt better there, and he still felt like a good wash; he needed to get rid of all this sweat and clamminess, wash all the dust and the lead off his face and hands.
He could do that back at Mrs Short's.
He would gain strength from being back with his books, his bed and his little bits and pieces.
He could have a look at the Evidence, again; that would be good.
He could start re-reading a book.
He had a lot of books.
Most of them were Science Fiction or Fantasy.
He had long ago realised that if he was going to find any clues to the whereabouts of the Way Out, the location or identity of the Key, there was a good chance he might get some ideas from that type of writing.
He knew this from the way he felt attracted to it.
It was a contemptuous sop of a clue, something they thought they could afford, but it might be useful.
Obviously they thought that by letting this sort of thing out they would have an excuse for  putting him away if he ever attempted to call their bluff, "Ha!" they would be able to say,"Crazy; read too much SF.
Bonkers; let us put him away and keep him under sedation and have done with him,"That was the way their minds worked.
That realisation was supposed to put him off, but he was too clever for them.
He bought all the most fantastic "unrealistic" fiction he could find and afford; by the rules they must have hidden a clue away in it"somewhere.
One day he would open up a book —some new sword-and-sorcery trilogy, probably —and something he would read there would trigger what he knew was locked away in his own brain somewhere.
It might be the name of a character (there was one already he was sure sounded familiar; it was one of his bits of Evidence), it might be the description of a place or a sequence of events…all he needed was that Key.
Escapism, they called it, Oh, they were clever all right!
His room was full of books; thick, dog-eared, broken-spined gaudy-covered paperbacks.
They lay on the floor, stacked on their sides because he didn't have any proper shelves.
The floor of his room was like a maze, with tower-blocks of books, whole walls of them set out on the thin carpet and holed linoleum so that only small corridors for him to walk in remained between them.
He could go from bed to window and table, to cupboard and door and fire and wash-handbasin, but only by certain routes.
Making the bed was difficult.
Pulling the drawers in the cupboard out properly needed great care.
Coming back to the place drunk, especially when he couldn't find the light switch, was horrendous; he would wake to a sight like Manhattan after a severe earthquake.
In paperback.
But it was worth it.
He needed both those avenues of escape; drink because it felt like escape, a way out of their fetid reality for a while…and the books because they soothed, they offered hope.
He might lose himself in the books sometimes, but he might find the Key there, too.
A car he was heading for to draw his next breath suddenly drove off.
Steven cursed inwardly and had to step up on to a low wall above the height of the laser-axles to empty and fill his lungs again.
He got down from the wall and walked on.
He'd show them all, one day.
All the people who had taunted him and hurt him and confused him and denied him.
Even the ones whose names he had forgotten.
When he found the Key he'd  get them.
People like Mr Smith, Dan Ashton and Partridge.
He'd find that Way Out, but he wouldn't leave until he'd found them again and sorted them out.
They'd pay all right.
Couldn't even take a joke.
Throw a shovelful of tarmac into the canal and they went to pieces, it hadn't been his fault he'd tripped over the cat.
He knew he shouldn't have hit the animal, but he'd been angry.
Then Partridge had tried to wrestle with him, claiming later that he was only trying to "restrain" him.
Partridge had got all angry and upset soon too because as he was struggling with Steven a magazine fell out of his trousers on to the towpath of the canal and the other men had picked it up and it had been a spanking magazine so all the other men who weren't laughing and shouting already started teasing partridge; Partridge started trying to wrestle Steven to the ground but Steven had got free and clouted the other man with the shovel, which was still bloody from hacking the cat to bits, and after that, with the magazine coming apart as the other men grabbed at it and Partridge rolling about dazed on the towpath in the cat's blood and almost falling into the canal, Dan Ashton had said soberly that enough was enough and they'd better go and see Mr Smith the supervisor because they just couldn't go on like this.
They weren't getting the work done.
It was all horribly sordid, but the more he thought about it, the more he became certain that, far from being a disaster, leaving the Highways Department was in fact a real step forward.
It hadn't been much of a job after all; he had thought at first from the sound of it that it might mean travel, but it didn't.
He would definitely go to the pub later, he decided.
It was a day to celebrate.
For two reasons, he reminded himself.
Not that it meant very much, because when you thought about it it wasn't something really to celebrate but today, June 28th, was his birthday.
He stopped, opposite a car, of course, and looked at his reflection in a shop window.
He was tall and thin.
He had longish, lank dark hair he didn't wash often enough, it stuck out from under his red hard hat in scrappy curls.
His trousers were slightly too short, and showed off his purple nylon socks and his tar-stained desert boots.
His Paisley pattern shirt didn't go too well with the greying Marks & Spencer pullover he wore instead of a jacket, and he knew his fingernails were dirty.
But it was a good disguise, he told himself.
Great Warriors didn't want to attract too much attention to  themselves when they were trying to think their way out of their penalty period in the ultimate war.
A young woman who was dressing the female dummies in the lingerie department window Steven was looking at frowned at him and gave him a suspicious, disapproving look which he noticed her just in time to see.
He saw the half-dressed models then, and quickly walked away, only just taking a deep breath in time as he walked out from the cover of the parked car.
 "Many happy returns," he said to himself, then suddenly gulped as he put his hand to his mouth and looked around.
What was he saying?
ONE-DIMENSIONAL CHESS
Quiss paused near the topmost window in the winding-stair.
His old body, for all its girth, thick size and seeming weight of muscle, was less than fit, and not so warm either.
The cold air of the castle fumed from his mouth as he rested, gathering breath.
It was dark in the turret stair, the only light coming from a small open window just round the twist in the rising steps.
The steamy clouds of his breath were first caught in the light from above, then pulled slowly away in a draught from the same source.
He wondered if Ajayi had finished the game yet.
Probably not.
Prevaricating woman.
He sighed and set off up the stairs again, pulling himself up by his hands on the thick, frozen rope fixed to the outside of the staircase, the castle's concession to their earlier request for a handhold on the often ice-slicked steps.
Ajayi was in the games room still, hunkered over the small table in her furs, huge as a bear, perched on a small stool all but hidden beneath the furs and cloths which smothered her old frame.
She didn't look up as Quiss —panting heavily —appeared at the top of the stairs and made his way down the length of the dimly lit room.
She seemed to notice him only as he came closer, up to his chair, facing her across the small, four-legged table with the dully glowing red jewel in its centre.
Ajayi smiled and nodded, perhaps at the man, perhaps at the thin, wavering line of squares which seemed to hang in the air over the small circular table.
The thin line of squares —alternately black and white, like tiny isolated tiles of shadow and mist —stretched over the table, through the air on either side of it, and disappeared into the distant side walls of the broad games room, over fallen slates and past rusting columns of wrought iron.
The flat string of squares flickered slightly just sufficiently to show it was a projection, nothing real; but although it was apparent the line of squares itself was merely an image, on its surface sat seemingly real and solid wooden chess pieces made from black and white wood, and set on that strange line like tiny isolated guard towers on a chequered frontier wall.
Ajayi looked slowly up at her companion, her old lined face gradually contorting into a smile.
Quiss looked down at her.
Maybe there's something of the reptile in her, he thought.
Maybe she slows down in the cold.
As though I didn't have enough problems.
 "Well?" the old woman said.
 "Well what?" 
Quiss said, still breathing hard from his walk up the stairs from the castle's lower levels.
What was she asking him questions for?
He was the one who should be doing the asking.
Why hadn't she finished the game yet?
Who was she still just sitting looking at it?
 "What did they say?" 
Ajayi asked patiently, smiling a little.
 "Oh," Quiss said, shaking his great bearded head quickly as though the whole subject was of too little consequence to be worth discussing,"they said they'd see what they could do.
I told them if we didn't get more light and heat up here soon I'd tear a few more of them apart, but after that they only started acting all stupid, and anyway they'll soon forget; they always do."
 "You didn't see the seneschal himself then?" 
Ajayi said.
She sounded disappointed, and a small frown creased her forehead.
"No.
He was busy, they said.
Just saw the little bastards."
Quiss sat down heavily on his small chair, wrapping some more furs around himself to keep warm.
He stared mournfully at the bright strip which appeared to float in the cold air over the small table.
In the centre of the table's delicately carved surface the jewel, which was the colour of blood, shone like something warm.
Ajayi pointed at one of the wooden chess pieces —a black queen —and said,"Well, I think you're too hard on them.
That's not the way to get results.
By the way, I think that's checkmate."
"You don't know Quiss began, then gave a start as the last part of what his adversary had said sank in.
He frowned deeply and  peered at the narrow line of black and white spaces hanging in the air in front of him.
 "What?" he said.
 "Checkmate" Ajayi said, her old voice slightly cracked and uneven.
 "I think." 
 "Where?" 
Quiss said indignantly, sitting back with a smile somewhere between annoyance and relief.
"That's only check; I can get out of it.
There."
He leaned forward quickly and took hold of a white bishop icing it one black square further forward, in front of his king.
Ajayi smiled and shook her head; she put her hand just to one side of the glittering projected line of squares and seemed to fumble with something invisible in the air.
A black knight appeared, as though out of profound shadow, on the surface of the ultimately narrow board.
Quiss took in his breath to say something then held it.
 "Sorry." 
Ajayi said, "that's mate." 
She said it quietly, but then wished she hadn't spoken at all.
She frowned to herself, but Quiss was too absorbed glaring at the board—looking desperately up and down its length for useful pieces that were not there —to notice what she'd said.
Ajayi sat back in her little stool and stretched.
She put her arms out from her sides and back, arching her spine and pondering vaguely as she did so why it had been thought necessary or relevant to give them such old bodies, perhaps to keep the idea of the passing of time, simple mortality, to the forefront of their minds.
If so it was a redundant measure even in this strange and singular place, even given their odd, frozen state (as the castle was frozen, so were they; as the castle was slowly crumbling but they stayed in their stasis, so their hopes, their chances decayed).
She got up stiffly from the table, with one last look at the scowling form of the man trying to work a way out of his hopeless situation, then walked slowly, limping a little, over the scratched glass floor of the room to the bright chill of the balcony.
She leaned slackly against the square pillar in the middle of the row of columns which divided room from terrace, and looked into the snowy distance.
An unbroken plain of white stretched to the far horizon, only the faintest shadings of light indicating any variation in the almost dead flat land.
To the right, Ajayi knew, If she leaned out from the balcony (which she did not like to do as she was a little afraid of heights), she would be able to see the quarries, and the start of the  thin, also snow-covered and treeless line of stunted hills.
She didn't bother to lean out.
She had no particular desire to see either the hills or the quarries.
 "Aaah!" 
Quiss roared behind her, and she turned in time to see him sweep his arm over the surface of the thin, artificial board in a gesture of fury and frustration.
Chess pieces scattered from the board, but blinked out the instant they dropped below the level it was on, as though falling beneath some invisible beam.
All except a couple of knights, which vanished as soon as they left the board itself.
The board flickered for a second or two, then slowly faded until it was gone, and Quiss was left sitting looking angrily at the small wooden table.
The faint glow from the jewel in the middle of its filigreed surface dimmed, went out.
Ajayi raised her eyebrows, waiting for the man to look at her, but he did not; he simply sat, torso perched forward, one elbow on his knee, hairy chin in one hand.
 "Fucking stupid knights." he said at last.
He scowled at the table.
 "Well," Ajayi said, leaving the open entrance to the balcony as a light wind picked up and blew a small flurry of snow around her booted feet, "at least the game's over." 
 "I thought we had a stalemate." 
Quiss seemed to be addressing the table, not his opponent.
"We had an agreement.
 "It was quicker this way." 
Ajayi sat down on the small stool on the other side of the table.
Light from the ceiling moved uncertainly over the carved wood Quiss was still staring at.
Ajayi looked at her companion's face in the dimness.
Quiss had a broad, dark grey face, covered with mottled black and white hair.
His eyes looked small and yellow, set in a tracery of deepening lines which seemed to radiate from his eyes like waves in a small still pool.
He still did not look at her, so she shook her head slowly, resignedly, and looked about the room.
It was long and wide and very dark, with many pillars.
Most of the light came from the openings onto the balcony.
There should have been light from above and below, but in fact there was almost none, and it was partly because of that, and because it was also rather colder than it had to be, that Quiss had set off something like an hour before to find some of the castle's attendants.
He was supposed to have asked politely for more heat up on their level.
but from what he'd said Ajayi suspected he had been his usual brusque and threatening self.
She would have gone herself, but her leg was  stiff and sore again and she wasn't sure she would have been able to manage the stairs.
She looked up at the ceiling, where one of the room's many odd columns flared into the flat, thick, pale green glass.
A single sinuous shape, shedding milk light, moved in the cold, murky water overhead.
It was one of the castle's many peculiarities that the interior lighting was produced by several species of luminescent fish.
 "Where's the bell?" 
Quiss said suddenly, sitting upright and looking about the room.
He got up from his seat as quickly as his thick furs and old muscles would allow, kicked some slates and books out of his way across the glass floor and started inspecting a pillar a few metres away.
 "They've moved it again" he muttered.
He started looking at some of the nearby pillars and columns, his boots scraping on the glass slabs of the floor as he moved.
 "Ah," he said, when almost out of sight, back in the depths of the room, not far from the small winding-stair he had entered the room by a few minutes earlier.
Ajayi heard a distant scraping noise as Quiss pulled on the bell-chain.
Ajayi picked up a small, thin slate from the floor at the base of the pillar behind her.
She turned the slate this way and that, trying to understand the curious markings scratched on its black-green surface, wondering idly which part of the walls the slate had fallen from.
She rubbed her back at the same time; bending to the floor had hurt her.
Quiss came back to the table by way of another small, though taller, table over on the far side of the room, where a few dirty cups and cracked glasses stood in a small tin basin under a dripping tap.
The tap was joined to a slightly bent length of pipe which appeared from a wall seemingly composed of tightly compressed paper.
Quiss poured himself a glass of water, drank it.
Back at the games table he sat down in his straight-backed chair and stared across at Ajayi, who put down the slate she was studying.
 "Of course the damn thing's probably not working," Quiss said gruffly.
Ajayi shrugged.
She pulled the furs more closely around her.
The wind moaned through the balcony window.
The castle had two names, as befitted its dual ownership.
The side Quiss belonged to called it Castle Doors, Ajayi's side named it the Castle of Bequest.
Neither name seemed to mean anything.
As far as they could tell, it was the only thing which existed here, wherever "here" was, Everything else was snow; the white plain.
They had been there…they did not know how long.
Quiss had found himself there first, and after a little while, when he realised that there was no night and day, just the one flat, monotone light always there beyond the windows, he had started to keep a tally of the number of times he slept.
The record was scratched on the floor of a small cell in a corridor off the games room; his bedroom.
There were nearly five hundred scratches on the glass floor now.
Ajayi arrived, seemingly deposited on one of the castle's high, flat, rubble-strewn roofs one night, when Quiss had made eighty-three scratches.
They had bumped into each other that "day" , and were delighted to find each other.
Quiss had been lonely with only the castle's shy and dwarfish attendants for company, and Ajayi was pleased to find somebody who already knew their way round the cold, forbidding stump of rock, iron, glass, slate and paper which was the castle.
It had taken them only a short time to realise they were from opposite sides in the Therapeutic Wars, but it had caused little friction.
They had both heard of this place, they both knew why they were here.
They both knew what they had to do, and how hard it was going to be to escape; they knew they needed each other.
They had been Promotionaries, on their respective sides of the Wars (which were not, of course, between Good and Evil at all , as non-combatants of every species always assumed, but between Banality and Interest), with great things expected of them once their training and indoctrination was completed; but they had each done something silly, something which called into question their very suitability for exalted rank, and now they were here, in the castle, with a problem to solve and games to play, being given one last chance; a long shot, an unlikely appeal procedure.
And an unlikely setting.
What strange architect had designed this place?
Ajayi found herself wondering every so often.
The castle, rising on a single outcrop of rock from the plain.
was built very largely of books.
The walls were mostly slate, apparently quite normal, grained rock produced by a perfectly standard physical process of alluvial deposition.
But when you loosened one of the slate blocks from the castle walls —an easy job, as the castle was slowly crumbling away —and split it open, on every surface so exposed a series of cut  or engraved figures was revealed, arranged in lines and columns, complete with word and line breaks and what looked like punctuation.
Quiss had demolished a significant part of the castle when he first discovered this, unwilling to believe that the stones, every one of them, all the tens of thousands of cubic metres the castle must be composed of, all those kilotonnes of rock really were saturated, filled full of hidden, indecipherable lettering.
The castle's stunted squad of masons and builders were still working to repair the damage the old man had done by tearing down walls in his attempt to prove these hidden glyphs were isolated aberrations, not —as they indeed were —ubiquitous.
This caused much grumbling and complaining, as the masons considered they were anyway fighting a losing battle against the castle's accelerating decay without its guests adding to their workload.
 "You called?" a small, cracked voice said.
Ajayi looked up at the door to the winding-stair expecting to see an attendant, but the voice had come from behind her, and she could see Quiss's face starting to turn red, his eyes widening, the lines around them spreading out further.
 "Fuck off!" he shouted over Ajayi's shoulder towards the balcony.
The woman turned round and saw that the red crow was perched on the balustrade, flapping its wings like a man trying to keep warm and looking in at them, its head cocked to one side.
An eye like a small black button glittered, fastening on them.
 "Given up on the game then?" the red crow croaked.
"Could have told you the Silesian Defence wouldn't work in One-Dimensional Chess.
Where'd you learn to?"
Quiss stumbled out of his seat, almost falling, scooped a flat piece of slate from the floor and threw it at the red crow, which screamed and jumped out of the way, spreading its wings and dropping away, flying into the cold clear space below the balcony, its final call echoing briefly, like laughter.
The slate Quiss had thrown sailed out through the balcony doorway after the bird, a stony imitation of its flight.
 "Pest!" 
Quiss spat, and sat down again.
The rooks and crows which lived in the decaying stumps of the castle's high towers could talk; they had been given the voices of Quiss and Ajayi's respective rivals, unfaithful lovers and hated superiors.
They would appear from time to time and taunt the old couple, reminding them of their past lives and the failures or mistakes which had brought them to the castle (though never  detailing them —neither Quiss nor Ajayi knew what the other had done to justify sending them here.
Ajayi had suggested they swap stories, but Quiss demurred).
The red crow was the most malicious and cutting, and was equally proficient at taunting either of the elderly pair.
Quiss was the more easily riled, so he tended to suffer more than his fair share of the bird's abuse.
He shook with fury sometimes, as much as cold.
It was cold because something had gone wrong down in the castle's boiler room.
The heating system was breaking down, needing repair.
Hot water was supposed to circulate beneath and above every floor.
In the games room, supported by slate and iron pillars, a tracery of iron girders held the low glass ceiling.
Inside the glass was water, about a half-metre or so of slightly cloudy and salty water the boilers were supposed to keep warm.
The same went for the glass underfoot; another half-metre of water lay underneath the transparent slabs which made up the floor, gurgling under the scratched surface and around the slaty pedestals supporting the columns above.
Long gelatinous-looking bubbles of air moved like pale amoebae under the false ice of the glass.
Luminous fish lived in the salt water.
They swam like long rubbery strip-lights through the water's gentle currents, and kept the rooms, corridors and towers of the castle bathed in a silky, pervasive light which sometimes made distances hard to measure and gave the air a thick sort of look.
When Ajayi had first arrived the games room had been just right.
held at a pleasant temperature by the warm fluid circulating above and below, and enjoyably light as well, thanks to the fish.
The odd system had seemed to work.
But now there was something wrong, and most of the fish had retreated to the castle's still warm lower levels.
The castle's black-cloaked seneschal had scowled darkly on the previous occasions when Quiss had tracked him down in the kitchens and asked him what was going on and what he intended to do about it; he made dour excuses and talked of the corrosive effects of salt water and what a mess it made of his pipes and anyway materials were very hard to come by these days — What days?
Quiss had exploded.
There was only one day, wasn't there, or did they have days here but they were just very long?
The seneschal had gone quiet at that and sunk his thin grey face back into his hooded cape, while the huge human stood glaring at him, quivering with impotent rage.
Time was another problem in the Castle Doors.
It went quicker  the closer you were to a clock.
The further away from a time-piece you were, the more it not only seemed to but did drag.
The clocks in the castle were immovable, and erratic too, going sometimes faster, sometimes slower.
There was one great clock mechanism buried deep in the warmer depths of the place, some vast assemblage of gears and creaking cogs which powered all the clock faces in the ramshackle shell of the castle.
Rotating shafts buried in the walls transmitted the energy from the central machinery to the faces, and rumbled in some places, squeaked in others, and leaked oil ubiquitously.
The oil mingled with the warm salty water which leaked from places in the ceilings, and that was one of the reasons they had asked for some sort of banister rail to hold on to in the narrow winding-stair.
The smell of oil and brine permeated the castle, making Ajayi think of old harbours, and ships.
Who time should go faster the closer you were to a clock, they didn't know, and none of the castle's waiters and attendants had any explanation either.
Quiss and Ajayi had carried out experiments using identical candles, lit at the same time, one hard by the face of a clock, the other in the middle of the room with them; the candle by the clock burned nearly twice as fast.
They had formulated some vague ideas which would let them use this effect to shorten the perceived time it took to play the games they had to play, but the castle clocks, or perhaps the castle itself, seemed unwilling to cooperate.
Taken near a clock, the table stopped working; the red jewel in the middle stopped glowing, the projection of the board and the pieces disappeared.
Added to this was the fact that the clocks themselves were so erratic; every so often they slowed down, so that time went more slowly the closer you were to them.
Whatever was affecting the rate time passed at seemed to obey the inverse square law, the phenomenon apparently radiating from each clock face, while at the same time there was a more generalised sort of effect emanating from the huge central mechanism buried somewhere in the castle's many lower levels, making everything down there happen more quickly.
The chaotic kitchens, where the seneschal had his office and where vast quantities of food were continually being prepared in conditions of the utmost confusion, noise and heat, seemed to be the worst affected place of all.
Ajayi could smell the cooking odours from Quiss's ragged furs as they sat, waiting.
 "Ah, here you are then," said a small voice.
Ajayi looked, Quiss turned, and there at the head of the winding-stair stood an attendant.
The attendant was short, about half the height of either of the two humans.
It was dressed in a sort of grubby grey cassock knotted with red string at the waist.
The cassock had a thin hood, held in place over the attendant's head and face by what looked like the brim from an old and worn red hat; it was squeezed down over the attendant's head, the top of the hood showing through where the hat's crown should have been.
The attendant's face was hidden by a papier mâché mask, as worn by all the attendants and waiters.
The mask was set in an expression of abject sadness.
 "Well, better late than never," Quiss snarled.
 "Dreadful sorry," the attendant squeaked, shuffling closer.
Little red boots, quite shiny, flickered under the hem of its cassock as it moved.
It stopped near the table and bowed, putting its small gloved hands into the opposing cuffs of its robe.
"You've finished the game then, oh, good.
Who won?"
 "Never mind who won," Quiss barked.
 "You know why we've sent for you, do you?" 
 "Yes, yes, I think so." 
The attendant nodded, its high voice not altogether as certain as the words.
 "You've got an answer, no?" 
It lifted its shoulders slightly, or dropped its head a little, as though frightened of being struck if its supposition was wrong.
 "We've got an answer, yes," Quiss said sarcastically.
He glanced at Ajayi, who smiled back and motioned towards the small attendant.
Quiss cleared his throat and leaned forward towards the small figure, which shrank away without actually stepping back, "Right," Quiss said, "the answer to the question is: You can't have both in the same universe, Got it?" 
 "Yes," nodded the attendant, "yes, I think I've got it: " You can't have both in the same universe."
Very good, Very logical.
That sounds like it to me.
I thought that.
That sounds —"
 "We don't care what you thought." 
Quiss interrupted, baring his teeth and leaning closer towards the small attendant, who shrunk back so much further Ajayi felt sure it was about to overbalance and fall backwards— "Just do whatever you have to do and let's see if we can get out of this filthy place." 
 "As you say, right, yes, will do, will do," the small figure said, backing off, half-nodding, half-bowing as it made its way backwards  to the winding-stair.
It tripped on a book and almost went flying, but it just succeeded in remaining upright.
It turned and hurried away into the darkness.
They heard its steps clattering and fading in the distance.
 "Hmm," Ajayi said.
 "I wonder what it does, where it goes." 
 "Who cares as long as it's the right answer," Quiss said, shaking his head and then scratching his chin.
He turned to look back at where the doorway to the stairs stood in the gloom.
 "I bet the little idiot forgets." 
 "Oh, I shouldn't think so." 
Ajayi said.
"Well, I do.
Maybe we ought to follow it.
Find out where it goes.
We might be able to short-circuit this whole ridiculous process."
He turned and looked speculatively at Ajayi, who frowned at him and said,
 "I don't think that would be a good idea." 
 "It'll probably turn out to be something really simple." 
 "Would you care to bet on that?" 
Ajayi said, Quiss opened his mouth to speak, but then thought the better of it.
He cleared his throat instead, and traced some, of the pattern on the top of the small wooden table between them with one stubby, yellow-grey finger, Ajayi said,"Perhaps we could just ask one of them.
Ask that one when it comes back; see what it says.
It might tell us."
 "We shouldn't need to ask it anything, not if that's the right answer," Quiss said, looking at the old woman.
 "This was your answer, remember." 
 "I remember," Ajayi said.
"The next one can be yours, if this one isn't right, but we did agree to do it this way; it was just luck it's my answer first.
We agreed to do it this way, do you remember?"
 "That was your idea, too," Quiss said, not looking at her, but lowering his eyes to watch his finger moving over the table's cut patterns.
 "Just don't start any recriminations, that's all," Ajayi said.
 "I won't." 
Quiss widened his eyes, held his hands up and out, his voice suddenly high in protest, so that he reminded Ajayi of a very large young child.
 "It's going to be a long time before we get another chance, though, isn't it though?" 
 "That's just the way things have been set up," Ajayi said, "that isn't my fault." 
 "I didn't say it was your fault, did I?" 
Quiss said.
Ajayi sat back, putting her gloves back on, She looked doubtfully  at the man on the far side of the table.
 "All right then," she said.
It had taken them almost two hundred and fifty of Quiss's "days" to discover what the way out was.
They had to answer a single question.
But first they had to play a series of odd games, working out the rules for each one in turn, playing each one to a conclusion, without cheating or colluding.
At the end of each game they had one chance and one chance only to answer the riddle they had been set.
This was their first game, their first attempt to answer the question.
One-Dimensional Chess hadn't been all that difficult once they worked out the rules, and now their first answer was being carried or transmitted or processed-whatever-by the small attendant with the little red boots.
The question they had to answer was quite simple, and they had been told by the seneschal that he had been told that it was an empirical question, not a purely theoretical one, though he had also said he found this difficult to believe, as even the mysterious powers and forces which moved the Wars themselves could not control such absolutes.
The question was: What happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object?
Simple as that.
Nothing more complicated or obtuse; just that, Ajayi thought it was a joke, but so far all the castle's inhabitants, all the attendants and waiters, one or two other subsidiary characters they had discovered, the seneschal himself, and even the ever-facetious rooks and crows which infested the decaying upper storeys had treated the question with extreme seriousness.
That really was the riddle, and if they got the answer right they would escape from the castle, be taken from this limbo and resume their duties and positions in the Therapeutic Wars again, debt paid.
Or they could kill themselves.
That was the unspoken alternative (or at least unspoken by all except the red crow, who cheerily brought the subject up on every third or fourth visit), that was the easy way out.
It was a long drop from the balcony of the games room; the castle apothecary carried a line of lethal poisons and draughts; there were ways out of the castle, a postern or two, and a narrow winding path through the fractured rocks and fallen masonry all tumbled round the castle's plinthed base like scree, then a long cold walk into the snowy silence…
There were times when Ajayi considered that way out; not as attractive then and there, but for when —if—there ever seemed to be no hope, at some time in the future.
Even so, she found it hard  to imagine ever becoming so desperate.
Time would have to drag on a lot longer than it had.
she would have to get a lot more fed up and tired with this old, time-frozen body before suicide became a serious alternative.
Besides, if she went, Quiss would be abandoned.
The self-destruction of one partner meant that the games could not go on.
The other one could not play on alone or find somebody else to play, and if the games could not be played and ended, the riddle could not be answered.
"Ah, excuse me, They both turned to look at the winding-stair door, where the small attendant was peeking round the side, most of its body hidden in the twisted darkness beyond.
 "What?" 
Quiss said,
 "Ah…sorry" the attendant said.
in a small voice.
 "Eh?" 
Quiss shouted.
his voice altering in pitch, Ajayi took a deep breath and sat back on the stool.
She'd heard.
She thought Quiss had too but he didn't want to admit it to himself.
"Speak up.
you wretch!"
Quiss roared.
 "That wasn't it," the attendant said.
staying in the doorway, Its voice was still small; Ajayi found herself straining to catch its hesitant words; "that wasn't the right answer, I really am" 
 "Liar!" 
Quiss rose off his seat, shaking with rage.
The attendant yelped and disappeared.
Ajayi sighed.
She looked up at Quiss, who stood, fists clenched, glaring at the distant, empty doorway, He turned, whirled round to look down at her, the scraps of fur around him flying out "Your answer, lady." 
he shouted at her, your answer; remember that!"
"Quiss she began quietly, He shook his head, kicked the small chair he had been sitting on, and marched off across the squeaking, grating glass floor, heading for his own apartments, Before he left the games room for the short corridor which led to his rooms, he stopped by the side wall of the room, where more conventional paper and cardboard books lined the slate fabric of the castle — the masons' lame attempt at insulation.
Quiss clawed at the wall, tearing the faded, yellowing books away from it, throwing them behind him like a dog digging a hole in the sand, bellowing incoherently and tearing and swiping at the wall, baring the green-black slate beneath as the torn, ripped pages fluttered away behind him falling to the grimy glass floor like some flat, grubby snow.
Quiss stormed off, slamming a door somewhere, and Ajayi was left alone.
She walked over to where the just-savaged books lay  strewn across the floor, and stirred them with the toe of her boot.
Some of the languages she knew, she thought (it was hard to tell in the uncertain light, and she was too stiff to be bothered bending down), and some she did not recognise.
She left the pages where they lay, one-dimensional flakes littering the murky floor, and she went to stand by the balcony window again.
Against the unending, unaltering whiteness of the plain, a flight of dark birds flew.
The same sky looked down, blank and forgettable and grey, itself unchanging.
 "And what next?" she asked herself in a low voice.
She shivered and hugged herself tighter.
Her short hair refused to grow any longer, and her furs had no hood.
Her ears were cold.
What was next, they knew already from the castle seneschal, was something called Open-Plan Go, Goodness knew how long that would take them to work out and play, assuming Quiss came back from his sulk.
The seneschal had muttered something about this next game being the closest analogue of the Wars themselves, which worried Ajayi for a start.
That sounded awfully complex, and long.
She had asked the seneschal where the ideas for these odd games came from.
He said from a place which was the castle's chosen Subject, and had hinted, she thought, that there was another way to get to this place, but refused to be more specific.
Ajayi was trying to cultivate the seneschal's acquaintance (when her sore leg and stiff back let her get down to the basement levels where he was usually to be found) whereas Quiss had started out trying to intimidate him.
When the man had first arrived he had tried to torture information on how to escape from one of the waiters.
It hadn't worked, of course, just made the others frightened.
Ajayi's belly rumbled.
It must be mealtime soon.
Waiters would appear shortly, if they weren't too frightened of Quiss being in a bad mood.
Damn the man.
Open-Plan Go, she thought, and shivered again.
 "You'll be saw-ree!" croaked a passing rook, cruising past on black wings and using the voice of an old, bitterly remembered lover.
 "Oh, shut up," she muttered, and went back inside.
ROSEBERY AVENUE
On the bridge which carried Rosebery Avenue over Warner Street, there was a smell of paint.
Black dust lay on the pavement collecting in the spaces of the bridge's primed balustrade.
Graham hoped they would paint the bridge tastefully.
He looked into the cradle the painters were using to paint the outside of the balustrade from, and saw an old radio so spotted with paint it could have been an art exhibit.
The man in the cradle was whistling to himself and coiling a length of rope.
Graham felt oddly satisfied at seeing life go on around him like this; he felt almost smug at walking past people and them not giving him a second glance, at least not now he'd got rid of Slater.
He was like some vital cell in the bloodstream of the city; tiny but important; a message bearer, a point of growth and change.
She would be waiting for him now, getting ready, perhaps only now getting dressed, or still in the bath or shower.
Now at last it was coming out right, the bad times were over, Stock deposed.
It was his time, his turn.
He wondered what she thought of him now.
When they had first met she thought he was funny, he guessed, though kind too.
Now she had had time to get to know him better, see other sides of him as well.
Perhaps she loved him.
He thought he loved her.
He could imagine them living together.
even marrying.
He would make a living as an artist —probably just a commercial artist at first, until his name became known —and she could do, whatever she wanted.
On his left were more buildings; light industrial and office premises topped by flats.
Outside an open door of something called the Wells Workshop, at the kerb, stood a large American sports car.
It was a Trans Am.
Graham frowned as he passed it, partly at its loud white-lettered tyres and obtrusive styling, but partly because it reminded him of something; something to do with Slater, with Sara even.
Then he remembered; appropriately enough it had been at the party when Slater had first introduced Graham and Sara to each other.
The coincidence amused Graham.
A smell of new shoes from another workshop wafted around him as he looked up at the old, stopped clock jutting out, two-faced, over the pavement from the first floor of the workshop, hands frozen at twenty-past-two (he glanced at his watch; it was actually 3:49).
Graham smiled to himself, and recalled that night, another of Slater's never-to-be-written plots.
"Right, It's Science Fiction.
There's this—"
 "Oh no," Graham said.
They were standing by the mantelpiece in the front room of Martin Hunter's large house in Gospel Oak.
Mr Hunter —Martin, to his students —was one of the lecturers at the Art School, and was giving his customary late Christmas party, in January.
Slater had been invited, and had persuaded Graham he would not be gate-crashing if he came along too.
They took along a box of wine they bought between them, and were drinking the red vin de table from plastic half-pint glasses.
Apart from some salty garlic bread, neither of them had had anything to eat for some hours beforehand so despite the fact that the party was hardly properly underway yet, they were both feeling the effects of the drink.
Music played loudly from the dining-room next door, where the carpets had been rolled back so that people could dance.
Most of the people in the front room were sitting on couches or beanbags.
Martin Hunter's own paintings, large gaudy canvases which looked like close-ups of minestrone soup seen under the effects of a powerful hallucinatory drug, adorned the walls.
"Just listen.
There's this lot of weird aliens called the Sproati and they decide to invade Earth"
 "I think this has been done before," Graham said, taking a drink.
Slater looked exasperated.
 "You won't let me finish," he said.
He wore a pair of grey shoes, baggy white trousers and what appeared to be a red tuxedo.
He took a drink and went on, "Okay, so they're invading Earth, but they're doing it as a tax dodge so that—" 
 "A tax dodge?" 
Graham said, leaning forward and looking Slater in the eye.
Slater giggled.
"Yeah, they have to spend so much of the galactic year out of the Milky Way or the galactic tax federation hammers them for gigacredits, but instead of paying for expensive inter-galactic travel they camp out on some backwater planet still in the galaxy and just hide, see?
But: something goes wrong.
They're coming in on a starship disguised as a Boeing 747 so that the locals won't suspect until it's too late, but when they land at London Heathrow their baggage gets lost; all their heavy weaponry ends up in Miami and gets mixed up with the luggage of some psychiatrists attending an international symposium on anal-fixation after death, and: Freudians take over the world with the captured high-tech.
arms.
The Sproati all get interned by the British immigration authorities; thanks to a false reading on a  spectrograph when they were planning the operation they've all taken too many tannin pills and they're almost black.
Usually they're light blue.
One —"
 "What do they look like?" 
Graham interrupted.
Slater looked confused, then waved his free hand dismissively.
"I don't know, Vaguely humanoid, I suppose.
Anyway, one of them escapes and sets up home in an abandoned but working car-wash in Hayes, Middlesex, while the rest die of starvation in the internment cells."
 "Doesn't sound like there's all that many of them, for an entire species" Graham grumbled into his glass.
 "They're very shy," Slater hissed.
"Now will you be quiet?
This one Sproati —we'll call him Gloppo —"
A couple of girls entered the room from the hall.
Graham recognised them from the Art School; they were talking and laughing.
He watched to see if they would look over at him and Slater, but they didn't.
He had on his new black cords for the first time (they were a Christmas present from his mother.
He'd told her what to get; she'd been going to get him flared jeans!), and he thought he looked pretty good in his snow-white shirt, black jacket, white trainers and lightly blonded dark hair.
 "Look, stop looking at those females and pay attention; you are  following all this, aren't you?" 
Slater put his face towards Graham's, leaning forward along the mantelpiece.
Graham shrugged, looked at the red wine in his glass, and said, "I don't know about following, feels more like I'm being pursued." 
 "Oh, très droll." 
Slater smiled artificially,"Anyway, Gloppo installs a brain in the car-wash so he can have sex with it —all those brushes and rollers and foam and stuff, you know? —while in Florida the Freudians are tightening their grip; they ban all phallic symbols including gear sticks, Jumbo jets, submarines and rockets and missiles.
All motorbikes have to be ridden side-saddle and bondage is right out: rolled umbrellas, stretch jeans and fishnet stockings are banned, on pain of having a Sony Walkman taped permanently to your skull playing a looped tape of Barry Manilow's Greatest Hits…except for Barry Manilow fans, who get John Cage instead."
 "What about," Graham said, pointing one finger at Slater, who pursed his lips and tapped his foot impatiently on the fire-surround, "those people who like Barry Manilow and John Cage?" 
Slater rolled his eyes.
"This is Science Fiction, Graham, not Monty Python.
Anyway, Gloppo discovers the car-wash has been unfaithful in his absence with a metallic-blue Trans Am —"
 "I thought that was an airline." 
"It's a car.
Now be quiet.
Gloppo finds the Trans Am has been screwing the car-wash —"
 "And the car-wash's been riding the car," Graham sniggered.
"Shut up, Gloppo disconnects the low-fidelity car-wash.
Now then…"
There were more people in the room now; groups of men and women; most of them young, about his age, stood and talked and drank and laughed.
The two girls he had noticed earlier were standing talking to some other girls.
Graham hoped they all realised that just because he was standing talking to Slater, that didn't mean he was gay too.
He looked back, nodding appreciatively, as Slater, talking quickly, waving his arms about, eyes glittering, seemed to approach the end of the story.
‘…shit-scared because he's about to be blasted into particles even smaller and more radioactive than Ronald Reagan's brain, goes to the loo; by sheer coincidence the crap he does solidifies in the intense cold of outer space and the pursuing spaceship runs into it at about half the speed of light and is totally destroyed.
 "Gloppo and his pal discover the joys of oral sex, the Freudians blow up the world, but that was going to happen anyway, and our two heroes live comparatively happily ever after." 
Slater grinned widely, took a deep, panting breath, then a drink.
"What do you think?
Good, isn't it?"
 "Well" Graham said, looking at the ceiling.
"Don't tease, you young blaggard.
It's terrific; admit it."
 "You've been reading that hook," Graham said.
"You know; that book by that guy.
"Specific as ever, Graham.
What an incisive mind; straight for the capillary."
I stand in awe.
 "You know the one I mean," Graham said, looking down at the blocked-off fireplace and snapping his fingers.
 "That one that was on the telly…" 
 "Well, we're narrowing it down," Slater said with a thoughtful nod.
He took another drink.
 "Earth got blown up in that one too…ah" Graham kept snapping his fingers.
Slater was silent for a second, gazing disdainfully at Graham's snapping fingers, then he said tiredly, "Graham, either concentrate on searching for the title of the book you're talking about or devote your full energies to practising calling for a waiter; I'm not convinced you possess the RAM for doing both at the same time." 
 "The Hitch-Hiker's Guide To The Universe!" 
Graham exclaimed.
 "Galaxy," Slater corrected dourly,
 "Well, it sounds like it." 
"Nothing like it.
You just don't recognise real talent when you meet it."
 "oh, I don't know." 
Graham grinned looking over at the two Art School girls, who were now sitting on the floor on the other side of the room, talking to each other.
Slater slapped his forehead.
"Thinking with your gonads again!
It's pathetic.
Here I am, yours for the asking; talented, handsome, lovable and affectionate, and all you can do is gawk at a couple of brainless broads."
 "Not so loud, you idiot," Graham —feeling somewhat drunk — scolded Slater.
 "They'll hear you." 
He took a drink and looked at the other young man.
"And stop going on about how wonderful you are.
You can be very boring, you know.
I keep telling you I'm not gay."
 "My God," Slater breathed, shaking his head, "have you no ambition?" 
Now, on this June day, Graham smiled at the memory.
It would have been a good party anyway, even if he hadn't met Sara, he thought.
The people were friendly, there was plenty to eat if they'd wanted it, and from what he'd seen there were quite a few unattached girls around.
He'd been thinking of asking one of the two who had entered the front room during Slater's monologue — the more attractive of them —for a dance even as Slater was telling him how desirable Richard Slater was.
It was funny, Graham thought; the party seemed so long ago, but the memory was more fresh and real for him than things that had happened even just last week.
He breathed deeply as he thought about it, passing postal workers from the Mount Pleasant sorting office standing talking just outside a small cafe.
A big red Italian car was parked at the kerb.
Slater would have liked it.
Graham smiled and crossed the road to the sorting office, smelling its new coat of paint.
Slater saw Sara standing at the door of the room.
His face lit up, he put his plastic tumbler down on the mantelpiece.
 "Sara darling!" he called, and went over to her, through a couple of groups of other people, and put his arms round her.
She didn't respond, but when Slater drew back her face held a slight smile.
Graham was staring, and saw the woman's eyes flicker his way for a moment.
Slater led her past the other people, over towards the mantelpiece and him.
Graham felt frozen.
People were still talking, chattering away.
Hadn't anybody else in the room seen her?
She was slim, quite tall.
Her hair was black and thick and looked tangled, as though she had just got out of bed and not brushed it.
Her face, all her exposed skin, was white.
She wore a black dress, an old thing with slightly tattered lace which filmed about her like some black froth.
On top of the thin dress she wore a brightly coloured, predominantly red, Chinese padded jacket; it seemed to sparkle in the room's dim lights.
Black tights, black low heels.
She was taking off her gloves as she approached.
Her upper chest, exposed for the breadth of a hand by the black dress, showed a strange white mark, like a sort of ragged and wide necklace settled loosely over her shoulders.
As she came closer he saw it was  a scar, the scar tissue even more white than the skin around it.
Her eyes were black, wide as though with some sustained surprise, the skin from their outer corners to her small ears taut.
Her lips were pale, and nearly too full for her small mouth, like something bled but bruised.
He had never seen anyone or anything quite so beautiful in his life; instantly, in less than the time it took her to walk from one side of the room to the other, he knew he loved her.
 "This is the little ingénu I keep trying to seduce, Sara," Slater said, presenting Graham with one delicate roll of the hand.
"Mr Graham Park, this is Mrs Sara ffitch.
Quite the most gorgeous and elegant thing to come out of Shropshire since…well, me."
She stopped in front of him, her head lowered just a little.
His heart was beating too hard.
He must be shaking.
She was looking at Slater through the black web of her hair; now her head tilted, she turned to face him, put her small hand out.
A Mrs!
She was married!
He couldn't believe it.
For the merest instant, some final, irreducible unit of desire, he had glimpsed a feeling, an urge within himself he had not imagined himself capable of, but now this tiny, standard piece of information, these few letters, had switched his hopes off like some cheap light bulb.
(Two summers ago, on holiday in Greece with a school pal he had since lost touch with, he'd been on a small, crowded, ramshackle train heading out of Athens over a scrubby plain in blistering heat.
Parched ochre land and scrappy shrubs moved monotonously by.
The rattling carriage was full of rucksacks and hikers, and black-dressed Greek ladies with chickens.
Then his friend Dave shouted "Look!" and when he turned, for a few moments only he glimpsed the Corinth canal; a sudden gulf sliced in the landscape, blue space sparkling, a ship in the deep distance; fathomless light and air.
Then the barren plain resumed.)
 "Hello," she said, and from his own eyes, hers flickered down to where her hand was held out to him.
He was aware of Slater drawing in a breath and putting his head back the way he always did when he was rolling his eyes, but before Slater could say anything, Graham quickly nodded, switched his glass to the other hand, and took the woman's small hand in his, shaking it formally.
 "Ah…hello." 
Her hand was cold.
How old was she?
Mid-twenties?
He let her hand go.
She was still looking at him.
Her figure even looked good; he wanted to weep, or throw her over his shoulder and just run.
What was she?
How could she do this to him?
She was still looking at him.
Such calm, steady eyes, the iris  and the pupil almost one.
Arches of deep dark brows like some perfect mathematical line.
He could smell her; a cold sharp distant sort of musk, like a window on to a forest of winter pine.
 "You mustn't worry" she was saying, smiling at him, "Richard hasn't said very much about you." 
She looked at the other young man, who had retrieved his glass and was watching Sara and Graham with a smile on his face, almost a smirk.
He shrugged.
 "He's never even Graham swallowed, tried to stop himself sounding too amazed, —mentioned you." 
She smiled at that, first at him, then Slater.
She stuffed her black gloves into a pocket in the padded jacket.
 "Well," she said, looking at them in turn again, lifting her face to gaze directly at Graham,"if I may make so bold, chaps, how about a drink?
I was bringing my own but I put it in the wrong pocket of my coat and it fell through the lining and smashed."
Her eyebrows arched suddenly.
Slater laughed.
"What a wonderful story, Sara.
I'm sure none of us would mind if you just didn't bring any at all."
He turned to Graham.
 "Mind you, Sara does dress in the early Oxfam style, so she might be telling the truth." 
He looked at the woman, patting her shoulder and putting his glass on the mantelpiece again, "Allow me ma'm." 
He walked off through the press of people now all but blocking the way to the door.
Graham suddenly noticed the room was crowded, and getting hot.
He was alone with her, though, Slater gone.
She stooped, brought one foot up, fiddling with a strap on her shoe, then started to over-balance, tipping towards him!
He put one hand out; she put out hers and gripped his forearm, looked up briefly and made a noise which might have been "thanks" , and went on working at the strap of her shoe.
He could not believe this was happening to him.
He actually tingled where she touched him.
His heart seemed to be beating in some huge dry place an echoing cavern.
His mouth had gone dry.
She let go of his arm, lifting the shoe she had taken off, showing it to him and smiling.
She laughed, "Look," she said.
"See?
Wine."
He gave a small dry laugh of his own —all he could manage — and looked at the small black shoe.
The hourglass shape of white leather inside it, raked from toes to low heel, was stained pale red, and still looked damp.
She pushed it closer, laughing again and lowering her head as though shy, "Here, smell, if you can stand it." 
Her voice was deep, slightly hoarse.
He did his best to laugh, said heartily.
nodding his head, bobbing it from side to side, achingly conscious of how stupid he must look, "Yup, looks like wine to me." 
A terror seized him.
He couldn't think what to say to her.
He found himself looking round for Slater as she put one hand on the mantelpiece and slipped her shoe back on, fastening the strap again.
A wine box appeared above the crowd of heads by the door.
He watched it come closer, relieved.
 "Ah…here comes your drink, I think," he said, nodding to where Slater was pushing through the crowd, lowering the wine box and a glass he was carrying; smiling at them when he saw Sara and Graham.
 "I've been proving to Graham I really did have some wine and it smashed." 
Sara said as Slater, turning briefly to greet somebody he had just passed, came over to them.
He set the wine box on the white mantelpiece, held the fresh glass beneath the little tap, and filled the container almost to the brim.
 "indeed, I trust he was suitably impressed." 
 "Bowled over," Graham said nervously, then wished he could gulp the words back somehow.
Neither of the others seemed to think anything of it though.
But he felt bowled over, and could hardly believe it wasn't obvious to every single person in the room.
He took his plastic tumbler up again and sipped at the wine, watching Sara over the lip of the tumbler.
 "Well then, Sara," Slater said, leaning one-elbowed on the shoulder-high wood of the mantelpiece.
smiling at the pale-skinned woman,"how are we, then?
How's the old home town?"
Slater meant Shrewsbury, if Graham recalled correctly.
Slater glanced at Graham, "Sara and I were next-door neighbours for a while, I do believe our parents may even have intended us for each other at one time, without actually saying anything about it, of course." 
Slater sighed, looked Sara up and down, Graham's heart, or his guts, something deep inside him, ached, as Slater went on, "Not for me, of course, though looking at Sara I almost wish I was a lesbian, sometimes." 
Graham laughed, biting the sound off the instant he thought he was laughing too long.
He hid behind the wine glass again, putting his lips to the liquid but not drinking despite his dry throat; he would get too drunk.
He couldn't disgrace himself in front of this woman.
Was she as old as he'd thought?
Was Slater serious about  them being some sort of childhood sweethearts, or even just close enough in age for their parents to think…?
He shook his head for a second, trying to clear it.
The room seemed suddenly stuffy and close.
He felt claustrophobic.
There was a scream from somewhere in the house; the chatter of voices quietened briefly and he could sense heads turning to the open door leading from the room.
 "That, I suspect, is Hunter," Slater said unconcernedly, waving one hand.
"His idea of a party trick is to tickle his wife until she wets her knickers.
Sorry, Sara, I interrupted you…"
 "Nothing," she said,"I was just going to say It's dull and horrible.
I hate the winter there."
 "So you're here," Slater said.
The woman nodded.
 "I'm…staying in Veronica's place for now, while she's in the States." 
He heard something strange in her voice.
 "Oh God, that awful place in Islington," Slater looked sympathetic.
 "You poor thing." 
 "It's better than where I was," she said quietly.
She was mostly turned away from him; he could just see the curve of her cheek, the line of her nose, and as he watched she put her head down very slightly.
and her voice altered again, Slater tut-tutted to himself, looking into his glass.
 "Finally left him, then?" 
Slater said, and Graham felt his eyes widening, that pulling back of the skin towards the ears he thought he had seen frozen on her face, Left?
Separated?
He stared at her anxiously, then at Slater, and tried hard not to look as interested as he felt.
She was looking down, into her glass.
She hadn't drunk very much.
 "Finally," she said, bringing her head up, shaking her head not in negation but a sort of defiance, so that the tangled black hair bobbed once.
 "And the other one?" 
Slater said.
His voice was cold now, expression deliberately blank.
Something about his eyes was hooded, making his eyes, briefly, resemble hers.
Graham felt himself leaning forward, wanting to catch her reply.
Had she started talking?
Both their voices were low; they didn't really mean to include him in the conversation, and it was noisy in the room; people laughed and shouted, the music next door had been turned up.
 "I don't want to talk about it, okay, Richard?" she said, and to Graham her voice sounded hurt.
She turned fractionally  away from Slater and drank deeply from her glass.
She looked at Graham, not smiling, then her lips trembled and a small smile did appear.
Park, you idiot, Graham told himself, you're looking at this woman as if she was ET, Get a grip of yourself.
He smiled back.
Slater giggled briefly, then said to Graham,"Poor Sara married a cad who had the ill taste to become manager of a sewage works.
As I've told her, now that she's left him and his personal life's in such a mess, perhaps he'll do what these managerial types usually do in such circumstances, and throw himself into his work."
Graham started to smile, though he thought the joke itself might be in rather poor taste, but then he was aware of Sara turning quickly, putting her glass on the mantelpiece and looking straight at him, coming closer, her face set in strange hard lines, eyes bright, taking him by the elbow and turning her head as if to emphasise that she was talking to Graham, ignoring Slater, saying, "You do dance, don't you?" 
 "Oopsie-doopsie, me and my big mouth," Slater said quietly to himself as Sara took Graham's plastic tumbler and put it on the mantelpiece beside her own glass, then led him, stunned, unprotesting, through the crowd towards the room where the music was.
And so they danced.
He couldn't remember a single record, track or tape played.
Her body was warm through the layers of clothing they wore, when they danced slow dances.
They talked, but he couldn't remember what about.
They danced and danced.
He was hot, sweating.
his feet hurt after a while and his muscles ached, as though they were not dancing but running, pounding through a strange, noisy jostling forest of soft, moving trees in darkness; just the two of them.
She kept looking at him, and he kept trying to hide what he felt, but when they danced together, holding each other, he kept wanting to stop and just stand there, mouth hanging open; express through sheer immobility something he possessed no dynamic for, To touch her, hold her, smell her.
They went back to the other room eventually.
Slater had gone.
so had the wine box and Sara's glass.
They shared Graham's glass, taking turns.
He tried not to stare at her.
Her skin was still white, though a sort of heat seemed to radiate from her now, something  which he caught and felt, became infected by.
The room seemed darker now, and smaller than it had.
People moved and pushed and laughed and shouted; he was vaguely aware of them.
Around her neck, the white-on-white semi-circle of scar tissue seemed to glow in the dim light, like something itself luminous.
 "You dance well," she said.
 "I don't —" he began, cleared his throat,"I don't usually dance all that much.
I mean"his voice trailed off.
She smiled.
"You said you draw.
You're at the School?"
"Yeah.
Second year,"he said, then bit his lip.
Was he trying to prove how old he was?
People sometimes said he had a baby face.
He'd been questioned about his age in pubs several times.
What age was she?
What age did she think he was?
 "What sort of things do you draw?" she said.
He shrugged, relaxing a little; he had dealt with this sort of question before.
"What they tell me to.
They give us exercises.
What I really "Graham, who is this lovely young thing?" 
Graham looked round in despair at the sound of Mr Hunter s voice.
Their host was a huge, lugubrious man, who reminded Graham of Demis Roussos.
He was wearing some sort of brown caftan.
Graham closed his eyes.
Mr Hunter was what he resembled: a refugee from the sixties.
His fat hand squeezed Graham's shoulder.
 "You are a dark horse, young man." 
He swept forward towards Sara, almost hiding her from Graham.
"Graham's obviously so speechless with you he won't introduce you to me.
I'm Marty Hunter —(Marty thought Graham) —and I just wondered If you'd ever thought of doing any mob"
At that point the lights went out, the music groaned in a deepening bassy slide, and people made appreciative animal noises.
 "Oh fucking hell," Graham heard Mr Hunter says and then something huge squeezed past him in the darkness saying.
 "that's Woodall; he always finds the mains switch at parties…" 
Matches flared, lighters grazed sparks, just as, with a hiss, Sara came forward, hugged him.
The lights flickered on before Graham could do more than put his arms round her.
She pushed herself away again as soon as the lights came on, shook her head.
looking down, her perfume still spiralling away between them.
The music started again, people went "Aww…" 
 "Sorry," he heard her say,"I'm silly.
I get frightened at thunder …too."
She looked around, distracted, for the glass, but he was holding it, and handed it to her.
 "Thanks," she said, and drank.
 "Don't be sorry," he said, "I quite enjoyed it," She looked up briefly then, smiling uncertainly, as though she didn't believe him, He licked his lips, moved forward, put one hand out and touched hers where it gripped the glass, She kept looking at the empty glass avoiding his face.
 "Sara, I —" 
 "Can we,?" she began, then looked quickly at him, put the glass on the mantelpiece, shook her head, saying, "I don't feel all that well" 
 "What?" he said concernedly, taking her by one hand and a shoulder.
 "I'm sorry, can I…" she motioned towards the door, and he helped her through the packed people, using his elbow to get them out of the way.
In the hall they found Mr Hunter again, holding a slack bored-looking black cat.
He frowned when he saw them.
 "You look rather pale," he said to Sara, then, to Graham.
 "Your friend isn't going to throw up, is she?" 
 "No, I'm not," Sara said loudly, raising her face.
 "Don't mind me; I'll just go and lie down in the snow or something." 
She started as though to make for the front door, but Mr Hunter held up a hand to stop her.
 "Not at all, I do beg your pardon, I'll find you here, come with me." 
He put the cat on top of an old sofa which had been shoved against the hallway wall, and led Graham and Sara towards the stairs.
On the far side of Farringdon Road, Graham passed Easton Street where another painter's or window-cleaner's cradle lay on the pavement, up-ended for some reason, neat coils of rope around it.
Summer; the season for painting and scaffolding.
Getting things done after the winter cover-up.
He found himself smiling.
recalling yet again that first meeting, that strange, almost hallucinogenic evening.
He stepped past an old lady, standing still in the middle of the pavement, seemingly looking across the road at a man in elbow-crutches waiting to cross the street.
Graham, almost automatically, tried to imagine drawing the scene,
 "I saw Slater heading out the door with some rug-chested young Romeo," Mr Hunter said as they got to the second-floor landing in  the big house.
 "I hope you weren't depending on him for a lift, were you?" he asked Graham.
Graham shook his head.
Slater didn't even drive, as far as Graham knew.
Mr Hunter unlocked a door and opened it, switching the room light on.
"This is our little girl's room; you lie down, young lady.
And take good care of her, Graham; I'll send my wife up to make sure you're all right."
He smiled at Sara, then Graham, then closed the door behind them.
 "Well," Graham said awkwardly as Sara sat down on the small bed, "that's us told." 
He bit his lip, wondered what he was supposed to do now.
Sara put her head in her hands.
He stared at the sooty-looking ball of black chaos that was her hair, wanting her, terrified of her.
She looked up at him.
He said,"Are you all right?
What's wrong?
I mean, do you…are you hurting?"
 "I'll be okay," she said.
"I'm sorry, Graham; you go back to the party if you want.
I'll be fine."
He felt himself tense.
He went forward, sat on the end of the bed with her.
"I'll go if you want.
but I don't mind just sitting.
I don't want you sitting here by yourself, all alone.
Unless you want to be.
I wouldn't enjoy myself anyway, I expect, I'd be thinking of you.
I —"
He had been going to touch her shoulders with his arm, but she came towards him anyway, her head on his shoulders so that the perfume of her hair enveloped him, made his head feel light.
She seemed to slump; it was not an embrace and her arms seemed heavy and slack.
Her hands stayed in her lap, limp as puppet limbs.
He held her, felt her shiver.
He swallowed hard, looked round the room, at Snoopy posters, posters of horses in sunlit meadows, posters of Adam Ant and Duran.
A small white dressing table In one corner looked like something from a doll's house, gleaming and bright with tidy arrangements of bottles and jars.
She shook again In his arms, and he realised she might be crying.
He lowered his head to her hair instinctively.
She brought her head up, and her eyes were dry.
She put her hands on the bedspread, looked into his eyes, an anxious searching as her gaze shifted about his face, first focusing on his right eye, then his left, then slipping to his mouth.
He felt inspected, plumbed, and like a moth in front of some anti-lighthouse, casting a shadow-beam, making him want to pull back, fly away from the intensity of those black, searching eyes.
 "I'm sorry, Graham, I don't want to be a tease." 
she said, lowering her head again.
 "I just need somebody to hold right now, that's all, I'm going through…oh," she shook her head, dismissing whatever she had been about to explain.
He put his hand on hers.
 "Hold me," he told her.
"I know what you mean.
I don't mind."
Without looking at him, she slowly came closer again, then leant against him.
Finally her arms went gently round his waist, and for a long time they sat there, while he listened to the sounds of the party, and felt —against his side, and within the perimeter his arm made around her —the gentle ebb and flow of her breath, Please, please, don't come now, Mrs Hunter.
Not now, not in this perfect, fragile moment.
Steps thudded on the stairs, and his heart seemed to try to echo them, but the steps and some laughing voices went away.
He held her, wrapped in her smell, warmed by her nearness.
He felt drugged, by her perfume and her presence; he felt…like he had never felt in his life before.
This is absurd, he told himself.
What is going on here?
What is happening to me?
Right now I feel more happy, more satisfied than in any post-coital daze.
Those Somerset nights, in friends' cars, other people's houses, once in a moonlit field; my carefully scored and compared encounters to date; they all mean nothing.
Only this matters.
God, you fool.
In a rambling old house in Gospel Oak.
In London in January I lose my heart.
What are the chances she'll ever love me?
Christ, to be like this for ever, to live, to be together, to hold her like this in bed some night when she's afraid of the thunder, when I'm there to hold her, to be held by her.
She stirred against him, and he mistook it for something like the small movements of a child asleep, and smiled down at her through the slow current of perfume rising from her black, turmoiled hair; but she was awake and brought her head up, drawing away from him a little, looking at him, so that he had to hide his smile quickly, because it wasn't something he had meant her to see.
 "What are you thinking?" she asked him.
He took a deep breath, "I was thinking," he said slowly, conscious of her arms still round his waist (no; one hand went to her brow, smoothed her hair away from her eyes; there, though, it went back again, clasped lightly  behind him!),"about…whether you could tell from the wine on the inside of a shoe what type it was.
The wine, I mean; the vineyard and vintage, um…whether it was south slope or the soil had been especially acidic that year."
A broad smile, slackening her tensed-up, vulnerable face, filled the white space in the dark mass of hair.
His heart seemed to leap inside him, at the sheer beauty of her now, and the realisation he had produced this change.
He felt his mouth open involuntarily, and closed it again, speechless.
 "Or you could have champagne-tasting competitions from ladies' slippers," she said, laughing.
He grinned, nodded.
She sighed, her expression changed again, and she took her arms away from him, bent over as though hugging herself round the middle.
 "I think I'd better go to the loo," she said, then looked at him.
 "Will you wait?" 
 "I'll wait," he said, too solemnly, he thought.
He smiled, touched her hand again.
 "You sure you're okay?" 
 "Just nerves." 
She shook her head, looking down at his hand.
"Thanks for, well, thanks.
I'll be back."
She got up quickly, went to the door and out.
He collapsed back on the bed, eyes wide and staring at the white ceiling.
All his life he had not believed anything could be like this.
You stopped believing in Father Christmas, tooth fairies, paternal omniscience and in the sort of over-the-top crazy heart-thudding happy-ever-after love they told you was the ideal.
Life was sex, infidelity. divorces, Infatuation, yes, but love at first sight, smell, touch?
For him?
Where was that carefully nurtured fine cynicism now?
He lay on the bed like that, waiting for her.
He got up after a while and paced round the high-ceilinged room, looking at the layered posters and the soft toys, the two old wardrobes, the small ring-tree on the window ledge, hung with little cheap, colourful rings.
He touched the long, dark green curtains, looked out into the garden and over it at the house beyond, tall and dark, A dim sodium-yellow glow filled the sky; patchy snow blemished the garden.
The door opened.
He smiled and turned.
A tall, drunk-looking woman in a red jump-suit swayed in the doorway.
holding on to the outside of the jamb.
Her face was thin, hair yellow.
"You all right.
dear?"she asked Graham.
looking round the room.
Graham made a small smile.
"I'm fine.
Mrs Hunter.
Mrs ffitch is ah…in the loo."
 "Oh," the woman said.
He didn't think she remembered him; he had seen her, he recalled, at the end-of-term dance.
 "Right, then, Well…don't mess up the bed," She withdrew, closing the door.
Graham was left frowning at the door, wondering exactly what she meant.
It opened again and Mrs Hunter re-appeared"You haven't seen my husband, have you?
I'm Mrs Hunter, Marty's wife."
He shook his head.
He felt unfairly urbane; almost contemptuous of the drunk woman.
"No.
Mrs Hunter, "he said," not for a while."
 "Hmm," she said, and was gone.
He watched the door for a bit, but nothing more happened.
The party sounded loud behind it.
He thought he could smell dope; grass or resin fumes.
He went back to looking out the window, sometimes watching the reflection of the room in it.
He looked at his watch, wondering how long she'd been away.
It seemed like ages.
Should he go and check?
Would she want him to?
What if something had happened; she'd fainted?
He didn't even know where the toilet was up here.
He'd been once to the one on the ground floor, that was all.
Should he go looking for her?
It might look like nosiness, he might open the wrong door, embarrass people.
He paced the room, then lay down for a while, hands clasped behind his head.
He got up and went back to the window, willing the door's reflection to move.
It moved; he turned, just in time to see it start to close as a male face disappeared after a brief inspection.
 "Oh, sorry," a voice said.
A girl giggled outside, steps sounded.
He faced the window once more.
Finally, a sick feeling in his belly, as though something there was twisted, pulsing pain.
he left the room.
He found the toilet a floor down.
He thought: I'll try the handle; the door will be open and the room will be empty.
She's gone, I mean nothing to her.
He tested the handle.
The door was locked, It'll be a man's voice, he told himself.
It was a woman's.
 "Won't be long; sorry." 
 "Sara?" he said, uncertain, his voice shaking.
There was silence, and his eyes smarted.
It isn't her.
It wouldn't be her.
It wouldn't be her at all.
"Graham?
Look, I'm really sorry, I'll be out soon, God I'm sorry."
 "No, no," he said, almost shouting; he had to lower his voice,"That's okay, That's fine.
I'll wait in…the room, all right?"
 "Yes, Yes please, Five minutes." 
She was there!
He went bounding up the stairs, three or four at a time, praying to himself the room hadn't been taken over by some amorous couple while he'd been away, cursing himself for doubting her.
Now she'd think he didn't trust her.
The room was empty, as he'd left it.
He sat down on the bed, his hands in his lap, his heart thumping in his chest.
He stared at the bottom of the door.
I go into ecstasies because a woman is in the loo, he thought.
This is enough to make me feel like I own the world.
Can I tell anybody about this?
Can I tell Slater?
Can I tell mum?
Did she and dad ever feel like this?
She came back.
She looked whiter than ever.
Her breath was ragged and faint, pulsing, she lay down on the bed, not speaking to him.
She made him feel frightened, but as she lay down, eyes closed, on her side and facing him, something else in her, some frail, scavenging eroticism made him shake with desire.
Oh my God.
I feel like a rapist.
She's ill.
 "Are you" he choked on the dry words, began again.
"Are you really poorly?
Should we get an ambulance?"
 "Poorly" , she said, and smiled, her eyes still closed.
 "That's a nice word." 
She opened her eyes.
looking at him; she blinked in the light.
"I'm fine, really.
Really I am.
Just nerves; I'm a weepy female and I should probably be on valium, but fuck it, I'm riding it out, you know?
I've things to get over.
Sorry to be a bother."
 "It's no bother," he said, and was at last pleased with the way he had said something; warm, strong, not patronising, but caring, Did she hear it that way, though?
She nodded at him, eyes closing.
She sniffed at the top of her dress, over her breasts.
 "I'm sorry," she said suddenly, eyes open again, "I stink of some horrible aftershave." 
Graham realised that indeed there was a strong smell of cologne from her.
She smiled wanly at him and shrugged.
"I threw up.
This was all I could find to cover the smell.
I've brushed my teeth too, but I still taste it God, this is awful, Graham.
I'm using you like a nursemaid.
I didn't mean to.
 "Don't…worry about it," he said weakly.
Her eyes closed again.
 "You wouldn't get the wrong idea if I asked you to put that light out, would you?" she asked.
 "My eyes hurt." 
 "Sure," he said softly, and went to the door.
With the light off, cold yellow bands of light spread from the window.
She was a black pool of shadow on the bed, a space of darkness.
He sat down by her, and she raised one of her arms; he sat down beside her, muscles trembling.
Her arm pulled him gently down.
Her face was opposite his; close, indistinct.
 "This is terrible, Graham," she said, almost too softly for him to catch.
"You've been lovely and I'm leading you on but I can't deliver at the moment.
You'll hate me."
 "I" he began, but gulped that precipitous, too instinctive and glib statement back.
Too soon.
 "No," he insisted, "not at all." 
He put one of his hands out and took both of hers in his.
They were warm."
Just this is "he shook his head, not knowing if she could see, or maybe feel the bed bounce slightly, it's really nice," he gave a tiny, self-depreciating laugh on the last word, acknowledging its inadequacy,".
She squeezed his hands.
 "Thanks," she whispered.
They lay like that for a long time.
His thoughts were in a strangely distant turmoil, as though they were no more the workings of his own mind than the far —below hubbub of the party was his own voice.
In the end he gave up trying to analyse his own feelings, or even totally understand them, and lay there relaxed, listening for the slow, regular breathing of sleep, and wasn't sure if he detected it or not — The door opened briefly at one point and a young man's voice said "Shit," but Graham didn't even turn to look; he knew it could be nothing which would disturb them.
He held her in his arms, still and warm, and after a while in that darkness he felt as though he held nothing at all; it was like when a limb, having been left in the same position for too long a time, somehow loses all reference to the body, and for those instants before some willed movement the very location and attitude of that arm or leg is quite unknown.
He held her, but he felt nothing; she was there, and in his consciousness distinctly other and different, but she was also like some relaxed part of himself; a silent mix of Identities cancelled out, like the pale skin, white scar, dark clothes and black hair being equated and combined, and the resulting coalescence being clear, invisible…nothing.
Eventually she stirred, kissed him quickly on the forehead, and levered herself up, sitting on the side of the bed.
 "I feel better now," she said.
She turned to look at him in the darkness; he stayed  looking at her.
 "I'd better go home," she continued.
"Could you ring for a taxi?
Come; we'll go back down."
 "Yeah," he smiled.
The light was very bright when he switched it back on.
She yawned and scratched her head, messing her hair still further.
In the hallway he called for a cab for her, going to Islington.
 "Where are you going?" she asked him.
 "Can you come as far as Islington, do you want to take the cab after that?" 
The party was slightly quieter, but there were still plenty of people about.
A man and woman in punk gear lay asleep in each other 's arms on the couch in the hall.
Graham shrugged.
 "lslington's a bit closer, I think," he said.
Was she inviting him back?
Probably not.
She looked pained.
 "I can't invite you in or anything, I'm sorry." 
He hadn't thought so, but his insides still ached briefly.
 "That's all right," he said brightly.
"Yeah, Islington's a bit closer.
I'll pay half."
She didn't let him pay half; he didn't protest too much.
They got to the place where she was staying, a quiet cul-de-sac.
The taxi drove off; he couldn't afford taxis.
She looked at a big BMW bike parked by the kerb, then up at a darkened row of tall houses.
In the yellow light, her face was like a ghost's.
 "I keep saying I'm sorry this evening," she said, coming closer to him.
He shrugged.
Would they kiss?
It seemed impossible.
 "I wish I could invite you in." 
 "Not to worry," he said, grinning.
His breath made a cloud between them.
"Thanks, Graham.
For staying with me, I mean.
I'm such a bore; do you forgive me?
I'm not always like this."
"Nothing to forgive.
It's been great."
She laughed quietly when he said it.
He shrugged again, smiling hopelessly.
She came to him, put her gloved hand behind his neck.
 "You're lovely," she said, and brought her face to his, kissing him; putting her lips to his just like that, soft and warm and wet, better than any kiss, better than his first real kiss, making him dizzy with the feel of it.
He hardly knew what he was doing.
His mouth opened slightly, her tongue touched his upper lip once, then slipped away again; she kissed him quickly on the cheek and turned, walked to a doorway, fumbling for a key in a small purse she took from her old fur coat.
 "Can I see you again?" he croaked.
 "Of course," she said, as though it was a silly question.
The key slipped in, she opened the door.
"I can't remember the telephone number here yet; Slater's got it.
Ciao."
She blew him a kiss; her last few words, with the door open, had been whispered.
The door closed quietly.
He watched a light go on above, go out again.
It took him five hours to walk back to Leyton, where he had a bed-sit.
It was cold, it rained once, lightly, then turned to sleet, but he didn't care.
That kiss!
That "Of course" !
The walk had been an epic.
Something he would never, ever forget.
One day, or night, he would do that walk again, retrace his steps for the sake of nostalgia.
One day, when they were together and he had a good career, when he had his own house and a car and didn't need to walk and could afford taxis if he wanted them; he'd take that same route just for old times' sake, try to recapture the uncertain ecstasies of that dark, early morning trek.
Nearly half a year later, in the summer heat, he could still recall the feeling of the cold air on his skin, the way his ears became numb with the freezing cold, the way he kept bursting out laughing, holding up his arms to the cloudy dark orange sky.
He could smile at it now.
He'd had more time to think, to get used to this slightly absurd rapture.
He could accept it now.
He still couldn't entirely believe it, In the sense that he could not believe that it was happening to him, that he was so vulnerable to such a common, almost hackneyed feeling.
But it was there; he could not —in any sense —deny it.
Graham passed an abandoned workshop on Rosebery Avenue; posters advertised bands and their singles and albums.
The traffic roared and the sun beat, but he remembered January, and shivered with the memory of that long walk.
Half Moon Crescent, he had repeated and repeated to himself as he'd walked that night.
She lived in Half Moon Crescent (he had checked the number and the street before he'd started out on his trek, so that even if Slater had lost or forgotten her number, she would not be lost to him).
It became like a chant, a mantra for him; Half Moon Crescent, Half-Moon-Crescent, Halfmooncrescent…
A chant.
A litany.
CLERK STARKE
Unemployed!
He sat in a plastic chair in a Job Centre.
The chairs were all the same in these places; in every Social Security office and Job Centre he'd ever been in.
Not exactly the same as each other; he'd seen different types, but they were all the same types.
He wondered if any of the chairs provided protection against microwaves.
A woman had been talking to him, but she had gone away.
She didn't seem to be able to cope with him.
Probably they hadn't expected this.
They hadn't prepared properly.
He had decided not to go straight home, or to go to the pub yet.
That was what they would expect him to do.
Just sacked, or rather resigned, with all that money"; of course, the obvious thing to do would be go home to his room or to have a drink.
They wouldn't expect him to go to a Job Centre and sign on.
So when he had seen the sign ahead of him in the street, he'd walked right in and sat down and demanded to be attended to.
 "Mr…?" a man said to him.
Light suit, short hair, spotty face, but looking in charge.
He sat down opposite Grout and clasped his hands on the large white blotter which almost covered the top of the small desk.
 "What?" 
Grout said suspiciously.
He hadn't been listening.
 "Your name is…?" the young man said.
 "Steven," Grout said.
 "Ah…that's your first name?" 
Grout leaned forward, put one fist on the table and stared into  the man's eyes, his own narrowed and glinting as he said, "How many do you think I've had?" 
The young man looked confused and concerned.
Steven folded his arms and leant back, feeling triumphant.
That had floored him!
Steven put his safety helmet further back on his head.
This was quite good really.
He felt he had the upper hand for once, and they hadn't been able to set up the Microwave Gun yet, either; he felt cool and relaxed.
Of the two of them the young Job Centre man looked the more hot and worried.
 "Can we start again?" the young man said.
taking out a pen and tapping the end of it on his lower teeth.
He smiled impatiently.
 "Oh, yes." 
Steven said cunningly.
"I'm an expert at starting again.
Let's."
 "Fine." 
the young man said.
He drew a breath.
 "What's your name?" 
Grout said suddenly, leaning forward again.
The young man looked at him for a while.
 "Starke," he said, "Are you staring, or…" 
 "Look, sir," the young man called Starke said seriously, putting his pen down,"I'm trying to do my job here; now…are we going to approach this in a sensible manner or not?
Because if not, there are plenty of people"
 "And you look, clerk Starke." 
Grout said, and tapped one finger on the small desk.
Starke looked at the finger, so he withdrew it when he remembered how dirty his fingernails were.
"I'm unemployed, you know.
I don't have some nice safe little civil service job with pensions and…and things.
I'm a victim of the recession.
You may think it's all a joke"
 "I assure you" 
"but I know what's going on, and I know why I'm here and why you're here.
Oh, yes, I'm not stupid.
You can't pull the wool over my eyes like that.
I know what the score is, like they say, I may be thirty-sev—thirty-eight, but I'm "switched on" all right —thirty-eight ge, and I know everything isn't "hunky-dory" the way people think it is.
You may think it's easy for you, and it might be, but I'm not so easily fooled, oh no."
He sat back again, nodding emphatically.
He didn't always express himself perfectly, he would be the first to admit that, but it wasn't what you said, it was the way you said it.
Somebody famous had said that.
"Well, sir, I'm not going to be able to help you unless you let me ask you some questions.
 "Well then," said Grout, throwing his arms wide and opening his eyes wide,"get on with it.
On you go; I'm ready.
Ask away.
Starke sighed.
 "Right," he said.
 "What's your name?" 
 "Grout," Steven said.
 "That's your surname?" 
Starke said.
Grout thought about this carefully.
He always got confused with this.
Which was surname and which was Christian name?
It was like nett and gross; he always got them mixed up.
Who didn't people just say first and second?
Just to confuse him, no doubt, There was a way of working it out though.
If you were a "Sir" then the name just after that was your first name, so that must be the surname…and Christian name was easy because Christ had been Jesus Christ, so obviously therefore the Christian name was the second name…and that was how you could tell.
That seemed logical, but now he thought about it he wasn't sure that that wasn't the way to remember the way it wasn't, not the way it was.
He decided to play safe.
"My name is Mister Steven Grout.
 "Fine," Starke said, writing, "Grout" as in that stuff you put between tiles and bricks and things, right?"
He looked up.
Stevens eyes narrowed.
 "What are you trying to insinuate?" 
"I'm…
I'm not"
 "I will not be insinuated against," Steven said, and tapped the front of the desk.
"What business is it of yours to make insinuations against me, I'd like to know, eh?
Answer me that."
 "I" 
"No, you can't, can you?
And I'll tell you why.
Because I'm not here because I want to be, that's why.
There.
I'm not one of your scroungers.
I've never taken the easy way out, I'll have you know.
It hasn't always been easy but I've always kept my self-respect, and I haven't let anybody take that away.
I'm my own man and that's very important in these times, even if you haven't had the problems I've had, and you haven't, because that's perfectly obvious, you're sitting there and asking me the questions.
You've got to realise, clerk Starke"
 "I'm not" 
 "…that we're on opposite sides of the desk, as it were." 
He tapped the desk to show what he was talking about."
This is a symbol, you  know."
He sat back to let this sink in.
Starke looked at the desk.
 "It's a desk, Mr Grout." 
 "It's a symbolic desk," Grout said, jabbing his finger at it,"It's a symbolic desk because we're sat on opposite sides of it, and that's the way things'll always be.
Like that.
You can't tell me any different.
I know the score, like they say."
 "Mr Grout," Starke sighed, laying the pen down again,"I'm afraid this interview isn't really getting us very far.
You talked to my colleague Ms Phillips when you first came in"
 "I didn't find out her name," Grout waved one hand dismissively,"Well you didn't get very far with her either, did you?
And now "" I didn't get very far?"
Grout said,"I didn't get very far?
It's not my job to get very far; it's yours.
You're supposed to get far with me.
You're the people who get trained in this sort of thing, not me,"Steven said indignantly, and tapped the desk once more, for emphasis.
"How often do you think I do this, eh?
Answer me that.
Do you think I make a habit of this sort of thing, is that it?
Are you making insinuations again?"
 "I'm not trying to insinuate anything, Mr Grout," Starke said as he sat back in his chair, resigned.
He shook his head,"I'm trying.
I was trying to conduct an interview, and now I'm trying to explain to you that you're not making it at all easy.
First you made my colleague distressed"
"I could tell she didn't like me.
She was contemptuous.
I won't have that,"Grout explained.
Starke shrugged.
"Whatever.
Now you've made it impossible for me to carry out an interview despite the fact I've been extremely patient"
 "I'm not stopping you from carrying on your interview," Grout said, shaking his head.
"I'm not.
You ask your questions, I'll answer.
On you go.
Just ask what you want.
I'm very cooperative.
I'm just not prepared to be contemptuated against or be the object of insinuations, that's all."
The young man sat looking at him for a moment, then raised his eyebrows, sat forward and took up his pen once more.
"Very well.
We'll try one more time.
Your name Is Mr Steven Grout"
 "Correct," Steven nodded.
 "You've just left your previous employment, is that right?" 
 "Yes." 
 "And you wish to" 
 "Not," Steven said, sitting forward and tapping the desk as Mr  Starke sat back, slumping down with a sigh in his seat and shaking his head, smiling slightly,"because I wanted to, either.
They were out to get me from the start.
They wanted rid of me all the time.
I was hounded out.
They forced me to leave.
But I left of my own free will.
I wouldn't give them the satisfaction.
I resigned.
I have my pride, you know.
They can't kick me around."
 "Ah," Mr Starke said, sitting forward in his seat and looking more interested, "you resigned?" 
"I certainly did.
I wasn't going to let them"
"Well, you do realise, Mr Grout, that by resigning you have made yourself ineligible for Unemployment Benefit for a period of—
 "What?" 
Steven said, sitting forward.
"What's this?
I did the only decent thing I could do.
If you think I was going to stand there and"
"I'm sorry, Mr Grout, but I thought I ought to mention it.
You still have to register as unemployed, but for the first—
 "Oh no," Steven said,"I'm sorry.
that's just not good enough.
I've paid my stamps.
I've paid as I've earned.
I'm not a scrounger or one of these social misfits.
I'm a working man.
Not just now, perhaps, but I am, I certainly am.
I just wasn't going to let them sack me.
I was not, "he tapped the desk," going to give them the satisfaction, you see?"
"I appreciate that you would rather terminate your employment yourself.
Mr Grout, but the rules are that if you do then you have to"
 "Well, that's just not good enough, I'm sorry." 
Grout said.
They'd found him.
He was starting to heat up.
His collar felt itchy and he could smell some strange tense body-smell coming from his armpits.
Mr Starke was shaking his head.
 "Nevertheless" 
 "Don't you" nevertheless "me, young man," Grout said, raising his voice.
People were looking at him.
The sunlit Job Centre was quite crowded, he saw now.
The sun was slanting in through the windows and heating the place up.
But there was ordinary heat and there was microwave heat.
He knew the difference well by now.
Ordinary heat didn't itch the way microwave heat did.
Ordinary heat didn't come from inside the way microwave seemed to, affecting you all at once.
He decided to try ignoring it, and said, "Don't you" nevertheless"me, oh no.
I'm not having it."
Starke gave a small laugh.
A laugh!
Just like that!
"I'm sorry, Mr  Grout, but what you're not having is Unemployment Benefit.
You get Supplementary Benefit instead for the first six —
 "You're sorry?" 
Grout said.
"Well, you don't suit your sorrow like they say.
I want to know why I'm being victimised against."
 "You're not being victimised, Mr Grout," Starke said.
"The rules are that if you leave your employment voluntarily you have to wait six weeks before you can claim Unemployment Benefit.
If you are eligible, which I imagine you will be, you may claim Supplementary Benefit during the interim."
 "And what about my dignity?" 
Steven said loudly.
"What about that, I ask you?
Eh?
Supplementary Benefit, indeed!
I've paid my stamps.
I've paid my taxes.
This isn't good enough."
"I appreciate your position, Mr Grout, but I'm afraid that is the way things are set up.
You probably will be eligible for Supplementary Benefit; first you have to register"
 "Well, it's not good enough," Grout said, sitting straight up in his chair and fixing Starke with one eye.
trying to turn the tables again so that he would stop feeling uncomfortable and Starke would go back on the defensive.
"I'm being victimised against and that's all there is to it.
As though I haven't got enough  crisises to have to put up with.
But this won't be the last straw; they won't get rid of me that easy.
I'm just not —
 "Well, if you feel you've been unfairly dismissed," Starke said, you can go to the —"
 "Ha!" 
Grout said,"I'm unfairly everything.
Employed, unemployed, housed, treated; everything.
But you won't catch me complaining.
I've learned better.
Doesn't get you anywhere.
I'd rather keep my dignity."
He was trying to explain, but he got the impression he was losing out now.
Clerk Starke had the upper hand.
It was so unfair.
Those devils!
They hadn't said anything to him at the depot; they hadn't told him anything about not getting unemployment money.
They'd let him resign, just when they'd been on the point of sacking him.
Maybe just a few more seconds and they would have fired him and he wouldn't be in this position now.
Just a few more seconds!
The swines!
 "Well," Starke began, and started talking about what Steven should do about registering as unemployed.
Grout wasn't listening.
He watched the young man's face, now set in the sort of bored, practised, professional expression Grout had seen a hundred times before.
He heard the words "P45" in Starke's speech, and his heart sank.
That was what he'd dropped, wasn't it?
Or was it?
Ashton had shouted something which sounded like that, when he was running away from the depot.
Oh-oh.
A new salvo of microwaves hit him; he felt a rush of uncomfortable warmth slide all over his body, and he felt his face going red.
His skin prickled and itched.
Damn!
He'd felt so pleased, victorious even, after leaving the depot, that he'd quite forgotten about dropping the form.
But of course; Dan Ashton had chased after him with it.
Or at least, that was what they wanted him to think, he suddenly realised.
He didn't remember being given that form; they had probably not even given it to him in the first place.
If it was all that important then they almost certainly hadn't.
It was like when his Giro cheques from the unemployment people hadn't turned up the last time he'd been out of work; it was all done to wear him down.
They could talk all they wanted about incorrectly filled-out forms, wrong addresses and the like; he knew what was really going on.
They were slowly trying to destroy him.
They probably didn't have to refer back to their superiors-those mysterious Controllers, be they human or not —for instructions, they probably had their contingency plans all ready and prepared.
So even when he'd got the drop on them they could still count on messing him around somehow.
Devious bastards!
Sometimes he had to admit, he wished they would just leave him alone and let him live out this petty, pointless.
insignificant life in peace.
It might not be all that much, but it might be almost bearable if they didn't keep tormenting him.
It was an ignoble, unworthy thought, he knew, but he was —now, anyway —only human, and therefore prey to human weaknesses, whatever sort of superhuman he'd been during the War.
It was a measure of how well they had done that he even considered such an awful thing.
They had so oppressed his higher thoughts.
his own belief in himself, that he would almost trade the chance to return to his previous, glorious existence for some peace.
But he wouldn't give in!
They couldn't win!
All the same, he wished he'd paid a little more attention to what had gone on when he'd been leaving the depot so that he could have spotted when they carried out that trick with the form he was supposed to have dropped.
He wondered if they had some other  sort of beam they could train on him, which would make him forget things, or make his attention wander.
The trouble was, he thought, as Starke talked on, that it would be very difficult to spot when they were using such a subtly fiendish device.
This needed more thought.
But what to do now?
There was always Revenge.
He could get back at them in some commando-style way.
Ever since he had been at high school he'd found some enjoyment and relief by getting back at them in ways they obviously didn't expect.
He'd thrown rocks at windows of offices and works they'd sacked him from, he'd defaced buildings, scratched officials' cars and mutilated bonnet mascots (though that was largely for his own safety) and he'd made bomb-hoax telephone calls.
It wasn't much, and they would take it in their stride, no doubt, but apart from the fact these revenge raids certainly did upset his Tormentors a little , making life and their cruel purpose just that little bit less easy for them, the greatest effect was on him.
He relieved his frustration, he vented his anger and hatred.
If he'd tried to bottle it up he would have exploded one way or the other long before now.
They'd have been able to certify him insane, or he'd have done something so terrible and criminal they could have put him in prison, where he'd be sodomised and knifed; quietly disposed of without any fuss because the rules were different in there.
At least out here they had to play according to some sort of standard of fairness, even if it was a standard they could change as they went along according to how it suited them (like doubling the bus fares just after he'd found that job way out in Brentford), but in prison, even more so than in a mental hospital, there were no real limits to what they could do to him.
Starke was still talking, taking bits of paper out of the drawers in the desk and showing them to Grout, but Steven wasn't looking or listening.
His eyes were glinting as he thought about the revenge he could have on the Islington people.
He could go and dig up the roadworks during the night, and get some cement made up in a small container and cement up the holes in manhole covers you used to lift the things up by.
If he filled those in they'd have a devil of a job lifting them!
And he could attack the filled-in holes they'd done in Upper Street earlier this morning.
He'd leave the ones he'd done, so they'd eat their words about his way being inferior; that would be satisfying!
He stood up and pulled his hard hat down firmly over his head.
Starke was looking up at him; "Mr Grout?" 
 "What?" 
Steven said.
looking down and seeing the young man again.
He frowned and shook his head.
"Never mind.
Sort it out later.
I've got things to do."
He turned and walked away.
Starke was saying something behind him.
He'd show them.
He'd get back at them.
He bumped into some people waiting to join the queue for the seats in the reception area (ha; he'd got in just before the rush!), and went out through the doors back to the street and the bright sunlight.
He'd sort this unemployment stuff out later.
He should have gone to his local Job Centre anyway.
where they knew him.
Never mind.
He at least had some ideas for Revenge.
He'd go back to his room and change and wash, then…then he'd have a drink and think further about how to get back at them all.
Maybe he would even mount a punitive expedition tonight, striking while the iron was hot, and all that.
It was risky, especially considering he'd been out just that previous evening, putting sugar in car and motorbike petrol tanks, but it might be a good idea anyway.
He'd have to think about it.
He drew a deep breath and headed for the nearest parked car.
OPEN-PLAN GO
It took Quiss longer than he had expected to get to the castle kitchens; they'd changed some of the corridors and stairways en route from the games room to the lower levels, and Quiss, taking what he thought was the usual way, had found himself making an unexpected left turn and coming to a windy, deserted, echoing chamber which looked out over the white landscape to the tall wooden towers of the slate mines.
He had scratched his head and retraced his steps, then followed his nose to the chaotic kitchens of the Castle Doors.
 "You," he said, and grabbed one of the kitchen helpers who was passing by carrying a heavy bucket full of some steaming liquid.
The tiny scullion squealed and the bucket clattered to the floor, staying upright but letting some of its glutinous contents slop over the side.
Quiss heaved the small attendant up by the scruff of its neck until its face was level with his.
Its mask-face stared back at him with empty eyes.
The green brim round its stained, spotted hood was like a giant washer, or a ring round a rather grubby planet.
 "Put me down!" 
It yelped and struggled, the green cord round its waist waggling to and fro.
"Help!
Help!"
Quiss shook it.
 "Shut up you…spirochaete." he said.
 "Tell me where I can find the seneschal in all this racket." 
He jerked the attendant's whole body and his own head to indicate the kitchen around them.
Quiss was standing at the foot of a flight of steps, on the outer  edge of the pandemonium that was the castle's kitchens.
The kitchens were buried deep in the structure, far from any outside wall.
They were huge; there was a high ceiling, vaulted with cut slate on iron pillars, and standing where Quiss was, all the walls save for that immediately behind him were invisible, concealed by the rising steams, smokes and vapours from hundreds of pots, pans, vats, stoves, kettles, skillets, grills, tubs and cauldrons.
Light came from prisms hung in the roof; great cut slabs of crystal reflected light from the outside walls through long, empty light corridors and then down into the tumultuous kitchens.
Also strewn across the complicated ceiling with the prism ports, obscuring whole sections of the barrelled structure, fume ducts writhed like immense square-flanked metal snakes, their grilled, barred mouths sucking the kitchens' vapours away to be vented high in some converted turret.
The seneschal had told Quiss that the air circulation system was powered by one of the lowest ranks of the castle's diminutive attendants; they walked round inside treadmills linked to big watermill-like fans.
Quiss felt his eyes start to smart in the fume-laden atmosphere, and as he peered through the grey, yellow and brown clouds of rising steam and smoke, thought of suggesting to the seneschal —if he ever found him—that he somehow persuade the scullions powering these airwheels that they should run rather than walk.
It was, also, rather warm.
Quiss could feel himself starting to s "" eat already, despite having left most of his furs lying at the top of the steps he had just descended.
"I don't know the way!
I've never heard of him!"the squirming attendant said.
Its little green-booted feet made running motions, though they were about a metre off the kitchens slate-tiled floor.
 "What?" 
Quiss roared, spraying spittle into the scullion's mask-face.
He shook the thing roughly.
 "What, you excretory wretch?" 
"I don't know the way to the seneschal's office!
I've never even heard of him!"
 "Then how," Quiss said, bringing the blank, sorrowful face closer to his own, "do you know he has an office?" 
 "I don't!" came the yelped reply.
 "You told me!" 
 "No, I didn't." 
 "Yes, you did!" 
 "No," Quiss said, shaking the attendant roughly so that the crownless brim round its cowl fell off, "I," he shook it again, sending the thing's hood flying off its head and revealing the smooth  continuation of the mask over the creature's skull, so that its little arms waggled trying to put the hood back on again as Quiss finished, "didn't." 
 "Are you sure?" the scullion said groggily.
 "Positive." 
 "Oh, heck." 
 "So where is he?" 
"I can't tell you; it isn't allowed.
I -oh!
Don't shake me again, please!"
 "Then tell me where I can find the seneschal." 
 "Waaah!" the small attendant said.
 "You scrofulous tapeworm!" 
Quiss bellowed; he turned the attendant upside down and plonked its head into the bucket it had been carrying.
The steamy yellow gruel in the bucket splashed out on to the kitchen floor.
He let the minion struggle and kick for a little while, then hoisted it back out, shook it, and turned it the right way up again.
His hands were getting messy; he wiped them on the creature's cloak.
 "Now then," Quiss said.
 "That was horrible!" the attendant wailed.
 "I'll do it again and leave you there unless you tell me where the seneschal is." 
"The who?
No!
Don't!
I —"
 "Right!" 
Quiss said, and dumped the scullion's head back into the now half-full bucket.
He dragged it back out.
The small creature's head lolled slightly on its shoulders and its arms flopped by its side.
 "Tell you what," it said, breathing with some difficulty, "Let's both find somebody we can ask —" 
 "No!" 
Quiss shouted.
He held the weakly struggling thing by one leg this time.
He considered: surely things weren't so utterly disorganised in the kitchens that the scullions no longer knew who was in charge of them, or where his office was?
Had things come to such a pass?
It was a bad show, Quiss thought, shaking his head.
The attendant had stopped struggling.
He looked down, remembered what he was doing, said "Oh," and yanked the limp scullion out, dripping gruel.
He shook it for a while until it gurgled and moved its head weakly.
 "Are you willing to talk yet?" 
 "Oh, shit, all right," the attendant said weakly.
 "Good." 
Quiss walked over to a large range of working surfaces, hotplates, sinks and racks; he sat the scullion down on a flat  surface only for steam to issue suddenly from its rear; it squawked and jumped up.
Quiss apologized for setting it down on a hotplate, put it on a draining board instead, and splashed some water over its mask-face.
 "It's like this, you see," the scullion said, wiping its mask.
"We've started this new regime to make things more interesting down here.
When people ask us a question some of us always tell the truth and some of us always tell the opposite.
Some of us give correct answers and some of us give incorrect answers, but we're always consistent, you see?"
 "No I don't see," Quiss said, looking into the face mask.
Sitting on the tall range, its small legs sticking out over the bright brass rail which acted both as a safety barrier round the hotplates and as a place to hang grubby kitchen towels, the small attendant's face was almost at the same level as the human's.
Quiss waited for the scullion to draw breath, and looked round the kitchens again as it did so.
There were very few attendants visible.
He was sure there had been more when he first arrived; they had been scuttling about all over the place, carrying implements, standing on stools stirring steaming mixtures, chopping things and throwing bits and pieces into cauldrons.
Some of them had been mopping the floor; some washing plates and cups; some just running, not carrying anything, but speedy and purposeful all the same.
Now he could see only a few shadowy figures half-glimpsed through the mists of the cooking fumes.
He wrinkled his nose at the smells, thinking that the cowardly little wretches were trying to keep out of his way.
He hoped their cooking burned.
The scullion on the draining board started talking again.
"Well, it means that you've got to approach the problem in a logical manner, you understand?
It's another sort of game.
You have to work out the right questions to find out what you want to know, see?"
 "Oh," Quiss said sweetly, smiling pleasantly, "yes, I see." 
 "You do?" the scullion said brightly, sitting up.
 "Oh, good." 
Quiss picked up the small attendant by the front of its cloak and brought its blank face up to his own, scraping the creature's green boots over the surface of the draining board with a rattling noise.
 "You tell me how to get to the seneschal's office," Quiss said evenly, "or I shall boil you alive, understand?" 
 "Strictly speaking, that isn't a well-formed question" the scullion croaked, choking as Quiss's fist tightened the material round its throat.
 "Strictly speaking, you're going to be dead very soon unless you give me the right instructions." 
Quiss grabbed the scullion from the range, tucked it under his arm, and walked away from the entrance, straight ahead towards the centre of the kitchen.
The noises of the place went on around him, muffled only slightly by the mists and vapours; he could hear shouted instructions and curses, the clanking of ladles and giant spatulas, the hiss and splutter of frying, the sloshing of water and soups, the grating of giant pans being moved, the machine-gun chatter of chopping knives.
Overhead, apart from the whispering air ducts, he heard a creaking noise, interspersed with a light clinking and clanking.
Quiss looked up to see an overhead cable-car system of what looked like lengths of knotted string and bits of chain, running through little metal wheels set in the ceiling and carrying, on small hooks, cups and mugs and plates (so that was why they had a hole at the edge), forks and spoons and knives of every description.
They sailed overhead and swayed with the slightly erratic action of the cableway holding them, bumping into each other now and again and so producing the clinking noise just audible over the din.
Quiss heard rapid footsteps approaching through the racket, and ahead of him he saw two small scullions running towards him out of the mist.
The hindmost attendant was holding what looked like a large loaf of bread, and was using it to hit the minion in front, which was running almost doubled up, its little gloved hands held over its head, where the pursuing scullion was raining blows with the loaf.
Three metres in front of Quiss they saw the tall human and skidded to a stop, in unison.
They looked intently at him, then at each other, then executed a smart about-face; the scullion with the loaf threw it at the other, who caught it and started to hit the other minion over the head with it as they ran back into the mist the way they had come, their figures —one crouched almost double, one striking out with the loaf of bread —and their running footsteps quickly absorbed by the rolling mists.
Quiss shook his head and marched on, the scullion tucked under his arm, not struggling.
He caught sight of a few others, but they turned tail and vanished when they saw him through the mist.
He  called out to them, but they didn't come back.
There must, he thought, be thousands of these small attendants, waiters, scullions, masons, miners, mechanics and general helpers and dogsbodies in the place and around it; he knew something about provisioning and logistics, and the castle's kitchens could have provided ten-course meals every few hours for an army of tens of thousands.
It all seemed too large, too over-provided-for to feed them and the stunted attendants, even if there were a few more of them than they'd seen until now (and they were always complaining about being short-staffed, anyway).
Even the scale looked wrong.
The kitchens appeared to have been designed for human use, judging from the height of the working surfaces and the sheer size of the ladles, pots and pans and other pieces of equipment.
Hence the scullions having to use small stools to stand on when they wanted to do anything like wash up dishes, stir soups or work controls.
They seemed to have their own stools, Quiss had observed; they carried them on their backs as they made their way from one range to another, and Quiss had seen quite violent fights and rows breaking out over the disputed ownership of one of the small three-legged platforms.
They came to a sort of crossroads in the kitchens.
They were well out of sight of the broad flight of steps Quiss had entered the kitchens from, at a point where he could continue ahead into the mist, or turn either right or left, past huge fat stoves holding great rotund cauldrons of some bubbling, frothing liquid.
The soot-black metal of the stoves was carved with grotesque faces from which a dark heat beat out at Quiss.
A yellow-red light jetted out from the eye-holes of the distorted faces, like a bright beam shining through a keyhole in a door.
Leaking wisps of smoke wormed their way out from the sides of the stoves' doors, adding a pungent aroma of something like burning coal to the medley of smells produced by the man-high vats bubbling away on top of the bulging, flattened-looking stoves.
Quiss looked around.
He could see a few of the other scullions nearby.
standing on their stools stirring pots, wiping stoves, polishing stove-fronts.
They were all studiously avoiding meeting his gaze, though he thought they were watching him out of the sides of their eyes.
He brought the minion he had under his arm out, lifted it up to look into its blank face.
 "Which way?" he asked it.
It looked about, pointed left.
 "That way." 
He stuffed it back under his arm, marched off to the left past the heavy black stoves, through their radiated heat.
The scullions ahead of him got down off their stools and waddled away, disappearing in the kitchens' foggy wastes.
 "Are you sure you wouldn't like to ask more complicated questions?" the small attendant said, muffledly, from his side.
He ignored it.
 "I mean," Which way? "is a bit basic, wouldn't you agree?" 
 "Now which way?" 
He brought it up, let it look about as they came to another junction.
the cauldrons at their backs, great stone tubs set in the floor and covered with some sort of green scum on either side.
The attendant shrugged.
 "Left." 
Quiss went that way.
The attendant under his arm said, "That wasn't exactly what I meant; just adding a" now"on to the start doesn't really make much difference.
With respect I don't think you've got the idea of the sort of questions you have to ask.
It's quite easy once you get the hang of it.
Really, I'm surprised you haven't encountered puzzles like this before.
Think carefully."
 "Which way here?" 
 "That way." 
The scullion sighed and pointed with its arm.
It said,"I'm probably saying more than I should, but as I'm giving you the information without you asking for It, I don't think it's covered by the rules.
All I'd say is that what you have to do Is to ask questions which although are apparently about what you want to do…where you want to get to should really be telling you about the person you're —"
 "Where now?" 
"Left again.
Do you see what I mean?
What you're really finding out is the truth-telling status of the person you re getting the information from, so that Quiss half listened to all this as he watched, suspiciously, the same cableway of cutlery and cups squeak and rattle its way overhead, you can find out two things…no, wait a minute, come to think of It you're finding…hmm.
Let me think about this."
Quiss looked at the black stoves, the strange faces cast in hot metal the giant vats of liquid.
He made a rising, growling noise at the back of his throat and brought the scullion out from under his arm looking into its mask-face again.
 "We're back where we started, you lice-brained dwarf!" 
 "Well, I did warn you." 
 "Cretin!" 
Quiss screamed into its face.
He saw a cauldron to one side with its lid hanging above it, suspended on a pulley.
He hoisted the scullion up and threw the creature into the huge vat.
The scullion's whines and yelps disappeared in a series of gruelly splashes which spurted from the top of the big tub.
Quiss slapped his hands together and turned.
Almost immediately he was surrounded by what seemed like hundreds of the small attendants.
They flowed from every avenue of the kitchen, a waist-high tide of grubby, grey-cowled figures rushing in towards him, their coloured boots, sashes and hat-brims swirling out of the mist.
Quiss experienced the tiniest moment of fear, then savage anger, and was about to go down fighting —take as many of the little bastards with him as he could —when he realised that they were bowing and wringing their hands and making apologetic noises, not howling angry ones.
He relaxed.
"I tell the truth!
I tell the truth, honest I do!"one was shouting, and it and a few others tugged at the lower edges of the few furs he still had on and pulling on his under-breeches where they appeared out of the top of his boots.
He let them lead him away, straight ahead between the rows of cauldrons.
Other scullions were running in with ladders and lengths of rope, climbing up on to the big stove and scrambling up to the messy lip of the vat in which, judging by the amount of splashing and screaming, the small attendant still survived.
Quiss was led by the dwarfish scullions, through the banked ranges past gleaming tubs, boiling vats, open fires and grills past rows of massive, wing-nutted pressure cookers guarded by blast screens, under huge n-shaped pipes, bubbling and gurgling and leaking steam, and over the dainty, counter-sunk tracks of a narrow-gauge railway until eventually he saw a wall ahead, and was led up a rickety wooden staircase to a narrow gantry then stopped at a small wooden door set into the wall.
One of the attendants rapped on the door, then they all scampered off, a display of multi-coloured boots flashing along the wooden gantry until they vanished into the mist.
The door was thrown open.
The castle seneschal glared out at Quiss.
He was a tall, thin man of indeterminate age with hairless grey skin and dressed in a long black robe without ornament save for a small silver fork with twisted tines which hung on a piece of string  round his neck, and rested on the black breast of the robe.
The seneschal's eyes were long, seemingly stretched out at either side as though the eyeballs within were the size of clenched fists.
His right eye had two pupils in it, side by side in the grey whites.
 "Now what?" he barked when he saw Quiss standing there.
 "Guess," Quiss said, putting his hands on his hips and leaning forward, glaring back at the seneschal, who stood blocking the doorway into his office.
There still isn't any heat up there; we're freezing to death and we can't see to play this absurd game.
If you can't get more heat up there, let us move the games room down a few floors."
"Not possible.
The boilers are being repaired.
Full power soon.
Be patient.
 "It's difficult to be patient when you're dying of hypothermia." 
 "The engineers are working as fast as they can." 
 "So they can reheat our corpses?" 
 "I'll order more furs." 
"We can hardly walk for the weight of the ones we've got; what good will those do?
Haven't you got any thermal underwear, or even heaters?
Couldn't you build a fireplace?
We could burn books.
There are plenty up there."
 "Shouldn't do that," the seneschal said, shaking his head.
"Aren't two the same.
All unique.
Don't have two copies of any of "em." 
 "Well they still burn —they would still burn well." 
Quiss had to be careful.
He'd already burned quite a few wallfuls, and had come down, under protest as much to keep Ajayi happy as anything else.
She had complained about the waste, and said they shouldn't have to burn books to keep warm; it offended her.
Besides, she had said, perhaps they would take more time repairing the heating system if they knew the two of them were able to keep warm without it.
It was a bad precedent to set.
He had grumbled but agreed.
The seneschal said,
"Shouldn't be too long.
I'll have some hot bricks sent up.
 "What?" 
"Big hot bricks; glow red hot in the stoves; I'll have some sent up every mealtime; should last until next one; you can warm hands on them.
Surprising amount of heat thrown out.
When they've cooled down a bit you can put them in your bed, warm it up nice.
You'll be as warm as toast."
"Hot bricks?
Is that all you can offer?
Exactly how long until the boilers are fixed?"
The seneschal shrugged, studied the carving on the edge of the door he was holding, then said,"Not long.
You'd best get back to your game now."
The seneschal came out of his room, shutting the door quickly and taking Quiss by the upper arm.
He led him back along the wooden gantry to the steps.
"I'll show you out.
 "Good." 
Quiss said.
"there's a few questions I want answered.
First of all, where does all this food go?
You must make about a hundred times more than you need.
What do you do with it?"
 "Recycled." 
the seneschal said as they came to the steps and went down them.
 "Why bother making it all, then?" 
 "Never know who might drop in," the seneschal said.
Quiss looked at him to see if he was serious.
One of the seneschal's two right pupils seemed to be looking at him.
"Keeps them in practice.
anyway."
he continued, suddenly grinning at the tall old man as they walked between the levels of stoves and cookers and fires, Scullions ran about the place, carrying brooms and buckets and baskets full of hidden ingredients.
They were all very careful, no matter how fast they were going and how urgent their task seemed to be, to avoid getting under the feet of Quiss or the seneschal,"Yes…keeps them occupied.
Out of mischief."
the grey, skinned man said.
Quiss hmm'd to himself.
Well, he could understand that, but he still thought it was a wasteful way of keeping the lower ranks occupied, and it didn't square at all with the continual excuses the seneschal and his minions kept making about being under-staffed.
He would let it pass for now.
"Where does it come from?
I've yet to see anything except weeds grow in this place."
The seneschal shrugged.
 "Where did you come from?" he said darkly.
Quiss narrowed his eyes at the pupil which seemed to be looking at him.
indeed out of the corner of its eye.
He thought the better of pressing on that one too
They came to the place where Quiss had seen the inset tracks of the narrow-gauge railway.
A small train, hauled by a tiny steam engine and comprising double-bogied cars carrying three sealed, hissing cauldrons each, trundled slowly by, wheels screeching and clattering over a set of points.
Quiss and the seneschal stopped, watching the train pass in front of them, disappearing into the steam and smoke of the kitchens with a cacophony of rattles.
hisses and clanks, and a single, strangled whistle-blast, Then they walked on, Quiss swallowing a question concerning the train's destination.
There was a muffled explosion somewhere on their right, and a thick orange glow spread through the mist, like a setting sun.
There was a clattering noise and some howls.
The orange glow to their right faded but did not disappear.
The seneschal glanced at it briefly but did not appear excessively worried, even when after a few moments —the scullions running past and round them were all carrying pails of water and sand, fire blankets, cutting gear and stretchers.
"That's another thing,!
Quiss said as they came closer to where he had dumped the mendacious scullion in the cauldron.
 "With all this equipment for moving things about the place," he gestured up towards the moving line of clinking cutlery above their heads, looping under the assorted ducting and swivelled prisms of the kitchens' ceiling.
 "not to mention the clock mechanism and transmission set-up and the complicated plumbing for the floors and ceilings…" 
 "Yes?" said the seneschal.
Quiss scowled and said, "Why can't you get the food to us while it's still hot?" 
They were passing the vat Quiss had thrown the small attendant into.
The scullion appeared to have survived the ordeal and was sitting.
quivering and bedraggled, being wiped down by some of its colleagues.
An under-cook was supervising the cleaning of the stove around the cauldron and the preparation of fresh ingredients to replace those lost.
The seneschal stopped, looking at the work being done with a critical eye.
The scullions worked even faster.
The one Quiss had dumped in the gruel saw the huge fur-clad figure of the human and started shaking so hard that little flecks of soupy stuff flew off It, like water from a dog.
 "Well," the seneschal said, "it's a long way from here to there." 
 "So construct a dumb-waiter." 
"That would be the seneschal paused, watching one of the apprentice chefs dipping a long ladle into the cauldron the unfortunate attendant had just vacated.
The apprentice put the ladle to its mouth, then nodded appreciatively and started back down the ladder as the seneschal continued, going against tradition.
It is a great honour for our waiters to take our guests  their meals.
I certainly could not deprive them of that.
A dumb-waiter would be… "the apprentice chef with the ladle was talking to the under-cook now, who also tasted the ladle's contents and nodded, while the seneschal said, Impersonal." 
"Who cares if it's impersonal?
These aren't necessarily the sort of persons I want to have anything to do with anyway,"Quiss said, indicating the various attendants, waiters and scullions around them as the under-cook respectfully approached the seneschal, bowing to him.
The seneschal stooped slightly as the under-cook borrowed a stool and stood on it to whisper something into his master's ear.
The seneschal looked briefly at the quivering attendant being looked after by the others, then he shrugged and said something to the under-cook, who quickly got back down off the stool and turned to the others.
The seneschal looked at Quiss and said,"Unfortunately there are not only your feelings to be taken into account.
I have the welfare of my staff to think of.
Such is life.
I must go now."
He turned and left, ignoring the shouts and screams of the small wet attendant as —after the under-cook had gathered the other scullions round, pointed to the cauldron, the ladle and its own belly before nodding at the wet attendant —the kicking, howling creature was grabbed by the same scullions who had recently been comforting it, hoisted up the ladder still resting against the side of the great vat, and thrown back in.
The lid clanged down, rattling on its pulleys.
Quiss stamped his foot in frustration, then marched back up the steps to retrieve the rest of his furs and make his way back to the castle's upper reaches.
Open-Plan Go had turned out to be a game of placing black and white stones on a grid to claim territory on an infinite board.
It had taken him and the woman two hundred days —as they measured them —to work out and play the game.
Again, they were nearly finished now, and here he was yet again, trying to get the heating improved.
Since their last game, the heat and light had deteriorated.
 "And now I suppose it'll be my fault the heating hasn't got better immediately," he muttered to himself as he walked along the narrow passageway.
She would blame him.
Well, let her; he wasn't bothered.
Just so long as they could finish this stupid game and get on to his answer.
She might be better at thinking up things  as stupid as their games (infinite pieces which were only infinite in one direction, from a point; you could hold one end but it was still infinite!
Insane!) —but he was certain he had the right answer, and a more direct and obvious one than hers had been.
He should never have let her talk him into letting her give hers first when they had been deciding how to handle this whole situation.
Her and her smooth-talking, "logical" arguments!
What a fool he'd been!
 "We'll get it right now though," he said to himself as he ascended through the castle's twisted interior, and the light faded and the cold grew more sharp, and he gathered his furs more closely around him.
"Yes, we'll —I'll —get it right this time.
Definitely."
Muttering and talking to himself, the old, massive, motley-haired man shuffled through the darkening levels of the castle, wrapped in his furs and hopes and fears.
Quiss's solution to the problem, his answer to the riddle "What happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object?" was, "The immovable object loses; force always wins!" 
(The red crow, sitting on the balustrade of the balcony, had cackled with laughter.
Ajayi had sighed.)
The attendant came back after a few minutes, its little red boots ruffling the hem of its robe.
 "Much as I dislike being the bearer of bad news…" it began.
AMWELL STREET
A succession of heavy trucks rumbled down Amwell Street as Graham turned onto it from Rosebery Avenue; they were big grey lorries, stone or chippings carriers with great corrugated sides and a plume of dust trailing after them in the near-still air, Graham was heading slightly uphill now, and slowed his pace accordingly.
He listened to the traffic, felt the warm air slip by, moved his portfolio from one hand to the other, and thought of her.
He hadn't been able to see Slater for two days after the party, and that time had passed in a daze for him.
On the Monday, though, Slater had been in the small steamy cafe and sandwich bar on Red Lion Street which he usually spent most of his term days in, and Graham had supplied him with cups of tea and expensive rounds of smoked salmon on granary bread while Slater slowly, teasingly, told him about Sara.
Yes, they had been neighbours in Shrewsbury, but of course they had only seen each other during the school holidays, and of course they hadn't made friends over some grotty little terrace-house garden fence; he'd first noticed her from the tree house in his parents' garden while she was learning to ride her new pony in her parents' ten acres of mature woodland and well-kept pasture.
 "A tree house?" 
Graham teased back.
 "Wasn't that a bit butch?" 
Slater replied tartly: "I was being Jane, sweetie, not Tarzan." 
Sara's best years, Slater continued, had been just after leaving school.
She had been a scamp in those days, he said, sighing with  exaggerated wistfulness.
She drank Guinness, smoked Gauloises and would eat anything as long as it was loaded with garlic…
Odour-free she wasn't.
She carried a large handbag whenever she went out.
It contained potatoes to stuff up the exhaust pipes of expensive cars, and a very large sharp knife for tearing holes in the hoods of convertibles.
If it could be arranged, she threw up Into the cars through the holes so created.
She got drunk a lot and once did a strip on top of the piano in a local pub.
(Graham asked Sara about this, on one of their canal walks.
She smiled.
looked down at her feet as she walked, finally admitted, a little ashamedly, that it was all true; "I was wild," she agreed in her slow, low voice, nodding, Graham felt a sort of ache then, as he had when Slater first told him; he wanted to have known her then, to have been a part of her life during that time.
He was jealous, he realised, of time itself.)
She was three years older than Slater; twenty-three now.
She had been married for the last two years, to a man who really was a sewage plant manager (Slater was quite hurt that Graham thought he'd invented this detail for the sake of a joke).
She had married against the wishes of her parents; they hadn't talked since the marriage.
She didn't get on well with them anyway; probably she married as much to get at them as anything else.
It was a pity, because her parents weren't bad sorts; like his own, they just believed everything they read in the Daily Telegraph.
Sara had only one real skill, or talent.
Not having done very well at school (not even allowed to sit the Oxbridge exams), she had nevertheless been diligent about her piano lessons, and was in fact quite good on the instrument.
The horrible hubby had not encouraged this, however, and indeed had sold her piano one weekend when she was away staying with friends.
That hadn't been The Last Straw; far from it.
Selling the piano was only a few months into the marriage.
She ought to have got out then, but she, the stubborn one, persisted.
Hubby wasn't happy when no kiddies appeared; blamed her, Sara had tried to be the good wife but failed; the other wifies she was supposed to socialise with to further hubby's career were dreadful, brainless bores.
Social ostracism followed outbursts of silliness, hubby drank a lot, didn't hit her often but did bad-mouth her excessively, and took up fishing; went away for weekends with male friends she'd never heard of, Claimed to be tackling  rivers but kept bringing home filleted sea fish on the Sunday night, and was always suspiciously careful to empty his pockets when he gave her his clothes to wash.
She began to Suspect.
She had her own weekends, here in London, staying with Veronica, whose flat she was now looking after while its owner worked a year's exchange course at UCLA.
On one of those weekends she had met Stock, a photographer who did a lot of work for one of the newspaper colour supplements, though always under assumed names, for tax purposes.
Slater had seen him on his BMW bike, or just  getting off it.
Never seen him without his crash helmet on; could be an albino or a Rastafarian for all he knew.
Looked a bit like Darth Vader without the cloak.
Jealous, moody type, apparently; married too but separated.
No idea why he appealed to the lovely Sara.
Anyway, he thought they would be drifting apart a bit now, perversely but predictably because they were seeing more of each other, not just weekends; Stock stayed the night at the horrible little place in Islington quite often, but Slater thought Sara might be getting bored with the black-leather macho man.
The thing round her neck?
Scar tissue all right; a birthmark she'd had removed in early teens in case it turned malignant.
Yes, he found it perversely beautiful, too.
 "La Cicatrice" had been his pet name for her.
Finally Slater divulged the flat's telephone number, and Graham noted the seven numbers down carefully, double-checking them and ignoring Slater's snide remarks about quirky Sara with her terrible taste in men, and the unfaithful, untrustworthy nature of women in general.
He'd offered to swap stories about what had happened once they had each paired off at the party, but Graham wasn't going to tell, and told Slater so as he carefully wrote her name by the side of the numbers: Sarah Fitch.
Slater laughed, pointing and guffawing at what Graham had written.
 "Not one big" f"; two little ones.
Like British industry, our Sara's under-capitalised And no "h" on the end of Sara,"he said.
Graham called her from the School that day, found her in.
She said she was delighted to hear from him; he thrilled at the sound of her voice.
She was free the following Thursday evening.
She'd meet him in a pub called the Camden Head, at nine.
Looking forward to it.
He whooped for joy as he left the phone cubicle.
She was late, as she always was, and they only had about an hour and a half to talk before she had to go, and he was nervous and she looked tired though still beautiful in bright red cords, Arran jumper and tattily magnificent fur coat.
 "I think I might be falling for you, you know," he said as they were drinking up at eleven.
She smiled at him, shook her head, changed the subject, seemed distracted.
looking about as though for somebody she expected to see.
He wished he'd kept quiet.
She walked with him to the bus-stop, would not let him walk her back to the flat, said not to follow her; she'd watch, be angry.
She kissed him again, quickly, daintily.
"Sorry I haven't been great company.
Call me soon; I'll be on time next time."
Graham smiled to himself at the thought of that.
Her sense of time didn't seem to be like everybody's else's.
She kept her own time; some inner, erratic clock regulated her.
Like some conventional caricature of female punctuality, she always arrived late.
But she usually did turn up.
Almost always.
They met on week-days, not weekends at first, in pubs never very far away from the flat.
Small talk mostly; a slow process of discovery.
He wanted to find out all she'd done and been, everything she thought, but she was reticent.
She preferred to talk about films and books and records, and though she seemed interested in him, asking him about his life, he felt cheated as well as flattered.
He loved her, but his love, the love he wanted to be their love seemed stalled, stuck at some early stage, as though hibernating until the winter had passed.
She wouldn't talk about Stock at all.
Graham walked up Amwell Street.
How are you? he asked himself.
Oh, I am well.
He looked at his fingernails.
It had taken him half an hour to get his hands and nails clean, using white spirit and a nailbrush as well as soap and water.
A couple of specks of paint on his shirt had surrendered, besides.
He had used a friend's Nivea to restore some moisture to the scrubbed, parched skin on his fingers.
The only stains left on his hands were a few stubborn traces of India ink, left from the drawings of Sara he'd finished the previous day.
Graham smiled; she was ingrained in him.
He passed the entrance to a courtyard.
There was a banner slung slackly over it advertising a fete.
He gave the banner a second  glance, fixing its curves and lines in his mind, storing the sight so that he could draw it some time.
Tricks could be played, points made by drawing a drooping banner so that certain letters and words were obscured and altered by the folded fabric.
He remembered one time he'd walked up here, in May, after she had started seeing him in the afternoons and going for long walks along the canal-side.
It had poured with rain; a total cloudburst, thunder cracking and grumbling in the skies above the city.
He'd been soaked, and hoped that at least this might finally gain him entry to the flat; she'd never invited him in.
When he got there he pressed the button on the entryphone, waiting for the crackle of her distorted voice, but there was nothing.
He pressed and pressed.
He stood back in the street, the rain stinging his eyes, wetting him to the skin, getting in his mouth and eyes; warm rain, huge hard drops, slicking and sticking the clothes to his body; erotic, making his heart beat faster in a sudden, squally sexual fantasy; she would invite him in…no, better yet, she would turn up in the street, having been out, also wet to the skin, she would look at him…they would go in…
Nothing.
He walked all the way to Upper Street, near the bus-stops, before he found a free phonebox.
He stood in it, his clothes and skin steaming, dripping water into the urine-scented callbox, called her number, listened to it ring, called again, saying the numbers to himself like a chant, making sure his finger was in the right hole on the dial each time.
The double ring: trr-trr: trr-trr: trr-trr.
He listened to it, trying to will her to the phone; imagining her coming back to the flat after being out; she might hear the phone from the street…now she would put the key in the lock…now running up the stairs…now dashing in, dripping, short of breath, to grab the receiver…now…now.
Trr-trr: trr-trr: trr-trr.
Please.
His hand hurt, his mouth ached with the expression of tense anguish he knew he wore, water ran from his hair, over his face, down his back.
Water dripped from his elbow where it bent, holding the phone up to his ear.
Be there: be there: be there: trr-trr: trr-trr: trr-trr…
There were people outside the callbox.
It was still raining, though more lightly now.
A girl outside tapped on the glass, he  turned away, ignored her.
Please be there…trr-trr: trr-trr: trr-trr…
The door of the callbox opened eventually.
A wet-looking blonde in a rain-darkened coat stood there, glaring at him, "" Ere, wot's your game, eh?
I've only been standin' 'ere twenty minutes, 'aven' I?
You ain't even put your bleedin' money in yet!"
He said nothing; he put the phone down and walked away to get a bus.
He forgot to take his ten pence out of the slot where he'd had it ready, and he'd left a pile of tens and fives sitting on top of the directories.
He felt sick.
She apologised, over the phone, the next day; she'd been hiding under the bedclothes, playing her favourite David Bowie cassette at maximum volume on her Sony Walkman, trying to drown the noise of the thunder.
He laughed, loving her for it.
Graham passed a small hall; in its courtyard was a little stall selling cakes.
He considered buying a cake to eat, but while he was thinking about it he kept on walking, and thought it would look stupid to turn back so far up the street, so he didn't, though at the thought his stomach suddenly rumbled.
He'd last eaten about four hours earlier, in the same small cafe where he'd got Slater to tell him about Sara that January.
Graham crossed the road.
He was approaching Clairmont Square, at the summit of the hill, where tall houses, once genteel, then decaying, now undergoing gentrification, faced over tall trees to the bustle of traffic on Pentonville Road.
Graham shifted his plastic portfolio from one hand to the other.
Inside were drawings of Sara ffitch, and Graham was proud of them.
The drawings were in a new style he had been experimenting with recently, and now, he felt, he had got it just right.
It was perhaps a little early to be certain, but he thought they were probably the best things he had ever done.
This made him feel good.
It was another sort of omen; a confirmation…
Once they'd had a conversation on two levels, from street to first-floor window; it had been in April; on the second occasion he'd visited her in the afternoon, for a walk along the canal.
She came to the window when he pressed the button on the entryphone, poking her head out of the lower half of the opened  sash window, through dark brown curtains.
 "Hello!" she'd called.
He went out into the middle of the street.
 "Coming out to play?" he said, smiling up at her in the sunlight.
Just then the window had slipped, the lower half falling down on her; she laughed and turned her head round.
 "Ouch," she said.
 "You all right?" he asked.
She nodded.
 "Didn't hurt." 
She wriggled.
He shielded his eyes to see better.
"I think I can get back in.
Hope so, or I'm stuck here."
He gave a small, concerned laugh.
He thought suddenly of how she must look, seen from inside the kitchen she was leaning out of; an ugly sexual idea occurred to him, and he looked about for the big black BMW bike, but it wasn't there.
It never was when she invited him to meet her at the flat; she was keeping him and Stock out of each other 's way.
Sara was giggling.
 "Things like this are always happening to me," she said, and shrugged put her elbows on the sill of the window and smiled down at him.
She wore a loose, heavy tartan shirt, like some fake lumberjack.
 "So," he said, "are you coming for a walk?" 
 "Where shall we go?" she said.
 "Tempt me." 
"I don't know.
You fed up with the canal?"
 "Maybe," she shrugged.
Her eyes seemed to wander away from him, scanning the horizon.
 "Ah," she said, "the Post Office Tower." 
He turned round, looking south and west, though he knew he couldn't see the tall building from the street.
 "You want to go there?" 
 "We could go to the revolving restaurant," she laughed.
 "I thought they'd closed it," he said.
She shrugged, stretched her arms out, arching her back.
"Have they?
How boring of them."
 "Bit out of my price range anyway," he laughed.
"I'll buy you a Wimpy and chips if you're hungry.
There; how's that for an offer?"
 "The zoo," she said, and looked down at him.
"Aardvark and chips?
Chimpy and chips?"he said.
She laughed, making him feel good.
She said, "We could go to the zoo today." 
 "You really want to?" he said.
He'd heard it was quite expensive to get in.
But he'd go if she wanted.
 "I don't know," she shrugged again, "I think so" 
"The canal goes by the zoo.
Might be a long walk, but it would be nice.
Through Camden Lock."
His neck was getting sore from looking up at her.
She gripped the edge of the window sill, seemed to strain up on the window across the small of her back.
She's stuck.
he thought, but she doesn't want to admit it.
Proud; embarrassed, Like me, He smiled, perhaps he would have to go and get a ladder; rescue her, The idea amused him.
 "Did you know the canal goes right under this house?" she said.
He shook his head.
"No.
Does it?"
 "Straight underneath," she nodded.
"Right below, I looked it up on the map.
Isn't that amazing?"
 "Maybe there's a secret passage." 
"We could build one.
Tunnel."
Her voice sounded scratchy; he wanted to laugh at her but didn't, She was getting annoyed, embarrassed at being stuck out of the window, making conversation while she secretly strained, trying to heave the trapping window back up.
 "You having problems up there?" he said, trying to keep a straight face.
 "What?" she said, then "No, no of course not," She cleared her throat.
 "So, what have you been doing with yourself." 
 "Nothing much," he grinned,"just looking forward to seeing you.
She made a funny face, gave a snorting sort of laugh.
He continued, "I've done some more drawings of you." 
 "Oh yes?" 
"They're still not good enough, though.
I'm going to tear them up."
 "Really?" 
 "You're difficult to draw." 
He looked up and down the street.
 "Will you pose for me properly some time?" 
 "You mean improperly." 
she said.
He laughed.
"Better still.
But I'd settle for you sitting still for a while."
"Maybe.
One day.
Well, all right; yes, definitely.
I promise."
 "I'll hold you to it." 
 "Do" 
 "So, are you going to come down?" he said.
She really was stuck.
She turned her head round, he saw her shoulders tense and her back arch again.
She muttered something which sounded like a curse.
She turned to him again.
nodded.
 "Yes, yes, just a second." 
He grinned as she pushed up on the window sill, her head down, hair hanging blackly.
He could just see her face as he walked over to the pavement beneath.
She grunted; the window squeaked.
He looked up into her triumphant face; she smiled broadly and then pushed herself back, waving once, saying,"Ah, that's better.
See you in a second."
They walked to the lock at Camden; she didn't feel like walking very far.
They spent most of the afternoon in a poster shop, looking, then in a cafe.
She wouldn't walk back; they got the tube from Camden Town to the Angel.
In the train, in the tunnel, he asked her things he'd often wanted to ask, but never dared.
There was a sort of noisy anonymity about the rattling carriage which made him feel safe.
He asked her about Stock; had she come to London for him?
She said nothing for a long time, then shook her head.
She had come to escape, to get away.
The city was big enough to hide in, to become lost in and anyway she knew a few people here; Slater was one.
Stock was here too, but she had no illusions, never had had any illusions, about the permanency of their relationship.
She was here, she said, to be herself, to find her way again.
Stock was.
something she still needed, even yet; something to hold on to; a devil she knew, immovable in the change and flux of her life.
She knew they weren't suited to each other, really; she didn't love him, but she couldn't give him up just yet.
Besides, he wasn't the sort it was easy to give up.
She stopped talking then, as though she thought she had already said more than she should have.
She looked at Graham after a moment, put her hand to his cheek, said,"I'm sorry, Graham; you're good for me, I love talking to you.
That means a lot.
You don't know how much."
He put his hand on hers, held it.
She gave a brave little smile.
 "I'm glad I'm good for you." 
he said (keeping his voice down; there were people nearby), "but I don't want to be just like a brother to you." 
Her expression froze at that, and his heart seemed to sink into his guts as he realised he'd almost said the wrong thing.
But she smiled again and said, "I'd understand if you didn't want to see me any more," and looked down, away from him, at her feet.
She took her hand away.
He hesitated at first, then put his hand on her shoulder.
 "That's not what I meant," he said.
"I love seeing you.
I'd miss you terribly if, well, if you went away."
He paused, bit his lip lightly for a second,"But I don't know what you're doing.
I don't know what your plans are; if you're going to stay here or go or what.
I just feel uncertain."
 "Join the club," she said.
She looked at him, touched his hand where it rested on her shoulder.
"I think I'll stay.
I'm applying for the R.C.M. I had a place there if I'd wanted it, three four years ago, but I didn't go.
Now I might get a place there, this time.
If they'll have me."
He bit his lip.
What to do; admit his ignorance and ask what R.C.M. stood for, or just nod, make appreciative noises?
 "What exactly will you do there?" he said.
She shrugged, looked at her long fingers, flexed them.
"Piano.
I think I can still play.
I'm not getting the practice I should, though.
I've got this electronic one of Veronica's; well, one of her ex-boyfriends'…and its action is all right, but it isn't the same."
She shrugged, still inspecting her fingers, "We'll see." 
He breathed again, relieved.
Royal College of Music; that must be it.
Of course; Slater had mentioned about her being good on the piano.
 "You should have a shot on one of the pianos in a pub sometime," he said.
She smiled.
 "Well, anyway," she said, taking a deep breath.
He felt her slim shoulder move under the thick fabric of the tartan shirt,"as much as I know anything at the moment, that's what I think I'll be doing.
Staying here probably, for the next few years.
I think.
I've still to get myself sorted out.
But I'm glad you're here, you help me think."
She looked into his eyes, as if searching for something in them; her white face made the dark, heavy-browed eyes look lost and empty, and after a while he could not look into them anymore, and had to smile and look away.
Then, from nowhere, a kind of despair seemed to settle on him, and he felt lonely and used and cheated, and for a moment wanted to be far away from this slim, black-haired woman with her tense white face and her slender fingers.
The moment passed, and he tried to imagine what she was going through, how it felt to her.
The train shuddered and braked, slowing.
Graham had a sudden, strange image of the train in its tunnel suddenly bursting through clay and bricks into the canal tunnel under Sara's flat; taking some ancient subterranean wrong-turning and missing the  station entirely, smashing into the darkness and water of the old canal under the hill.
He tried to imagine drawing such a scene, but couldn't.
He shook his head, forgetting the idea and looking at Sara again as the train stopped in the station.
She sat forward in her seat, smiling wryly.
"All my life people have liked me too quickly, Graham, and for the wrong reasons.
Maybe you'll change your mind when you know me better."
The doors opened; she stood, and as he got to his feet, as they went out on to the platform, he grinned confidently and shook his head.
 "No way," he said.
And now, in June, how much better did he know her?
A little better; he had seen her in a few more moods, some higher, some lower.
Her attraction had only grown; he found himself trying to smell her hair when they sat together in pubs, he gazed out of the comer of his eye at her breasts under whatever jumper or T-shirt she was wearing, wanting to touch them.
hold them.
But it never seemed right; she would kiss him, for not very long, at the end of each meeting, and he could hold her, feel his arms around her narrow back, his body briefly against hers, but he could feel her tense if his hands went lower than the small of her back, and when he tried to kiss her more deeply, or hold her tighter, she would break away, shaking her head.
He had almost given up testing the limits.
But now what?
It sounded as though Stock was no more, as though at last she was free, strong enough to do without him, to get rid of his influence and accept Graham as more of —and more than —a friend.
Don't get your hopes up, not too much, he told himself.
It might not be all you hope for.
He stood at the side of Pentonville Road, by a telephone junction-box with posters advertising Woza Albert on it, and he told himself not to expect everything.
Hopes and dreams had a way of evaporating.
But he could remember the sound of her voice on the phone that morning, when he'd called her up from the School, too well.
 "Why don't you come in this time?" she said, "I'll get us a salad together, or something." 
 "Actually come into the flat?" he laughed.
 "You mean come oop  and —" ow you zay —zee you zome time?"he said, in a good mood, making a silly French voice which he started to regret almost as soon as he'd spoken.
Her voice over the phone was cool:
 "Well…why not, Graham" ?"
His throat went dry after that; he didn't recall what else he'd said.
