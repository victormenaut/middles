THE UK SPIRITS INDUSTRY — A MAJOR SUCCESS
The UK is the world's largest spirits exporter.
Three of the world's largest drinks companies, Allied Lyons, Grand Metropolitan and Guinness, are British.
Scotch Whisky is a core business for all of them.
Scotch Whisky provides 15,000 jobs, many in rural areas with few alternative opportunities.
The spirits industry, generated £2.4bn in revenue for the Treasury in 1991.
TAX OF SPIRITS — DIMINISHING RETURNS
Tax (Excise & VAT) is 66% of the total retail price of a typically priced bottle of Scotch Whisky.
Over the past three years
taxes on spirits rose by 14%
consumption is set to fall by 14%
excise tax take is set to fall by 2%
It is clear that Government tax ‘take’ from spirits has reached breaking point.
WINE IMPORTS
Wine is mainly imported
Tax (Excise & VAT) is 40% of the total retail price of a typically priced bottle of wine
The total UK tax ‘take’ in 1991 was £1.6bn
Over the past three years
taxes on wine rose 14%
wine consumption is set to rise 4%
excise tax take is set to rise 19%
SPIRITS EXPORTS: THE UK TAX EFFECT
UK spirits exports are hampered by UK tax policy.
UK drinks tax policy sets a bad example to our export markets.
Foreign Governments argue that tax discrimination against British spirits is acceptable, as this is the policy HMG itself pursues.
THE SCOTCH WHISKY ASSOCIATION SAYS:
Tax discrimination against spirits must end.
The Chancellor should use his two 1933 Budgets to reduce the differentials between the tax on spirits and the tax on beer and wine.
WHY IS SCOTCH WHISKY IMPORTANT TO THE U.K.?
Almost £2 billion annual export earnings
£1.0 billion a year in Excise Duty and Value Added Tax
15,000 employed, many in rural areas or areas of high unemployment
Over 70,000 jobs sustained — each whisky worker generates four jobs in supporting industries
WHY DO YOU HAVE TO PAY SO MUCH FOR SCOTCH WHISKY IN THE U.K.?
The Government takes 65 cent or more of the retail price of a typical bottle of Scotch Whisky.
An inherited tax structure discriminates deliberately against spirits in favour of beer and imported wine.
Normal measures of drinks contain about the same amount of alcohol.
Duty payable per measure varies widely.
THE SCOTCH WHISKY ASSOCIATION says
‘It is manifestly unfair that the alcoholic content of Scotch Whisky should be taxed almost twice as heavily as that of beer or wine.
The only fair system is to tax all drinks on the same basis according to their alcoholic content.’
WHAT IS THE SCOTCH WHISKY ASSOCIATION?
The voice of Scotch Whisky producers in the public arena, whose task is to:
Represent the industry's interests to the British Government and overseas governments
Promote Scotch Whisky as a quality product of natural ingredients
Protect the image and integrity of Scotch Whisky throughout the world, if necessary in the courts
Negotiate for the removal of tariff and non-tariff barriers
Fund research, counselling and education to combat problems arising from alcoholic misuse.
EC TAX HARMONISATION?
EC Finance Ministers, meeting in Brussels on 27th July,provisionally agreed a tax package which included minimum rates of excise duty on alcoholic drinks to apply from 1st January 1993.
The minimum Excise Rates are:
BUT:
In addition to the minimum spirits rate of 550 ECU per hlpa, a further threshold was fixed at 1000 ECU per hlpa,
preventing those Member States above this level from reducing their rate below 1000 ECU, and
preventing those between 550 and 1000 from reducing their spirits rata at all.
Review Clause
The agreement includes a vital clause stating that the Commission must examine the rates of duty laid down every two years, and for the first time no later than 31st December 1994.
This Review must include a report on the competition between different categories of alcoholic drink.
The Scotch Whisky Association says:
The ‘harmonisation’ agreement was successful in warding off the immediate danger of tax-induced price increases for Scotch Whisky in its all-important European markets, although the two-tier minimum spirits rate makes no sense and is hard to reconcile with ‘harmonisation’.
Equally welcome is the inclusion of the requirement that a review of how competition between different categories of alcoholic drinks is affected by the arrangements.
BUT: there is much to play for.
The agreed rates are only minimum rates.
There is no means of ensuring that discrimination against spirits does not widen.
There is no commitment in the longer term to eventual approximation of excise duties for all drinks, based upon their alcohol content.
It is imperative that the competition review should be a full and comprehensive study of the total drinks market so that any distortion emerges clearly.
THE UK GOVERNMENT IS URGED TO SECURE LONG-TERM FAIR TAX TREATMENT IN EUROPE FOR SCOTCH WHISKY
ANNUAL EXPORT EARNINGS ALMOST £2 BILLION.
IN 1992 SHIPMENTS TO 190 COUNTRIES WERE WORTH £1,958 MILLION — UP SEVEN PER CENT.
EUROPEAN COMMUNITY SALES (EXCLUDING UK) ACCOUNT FOR 40 PER CENT OF ALL EXPORTS.
IN 1992 SALES TO THE EC (EXCLUDING UK) GREW BY 6 PER CENT T0 £784 MILLION.
EVERY YEAR EXPORTS ACCOUNT FOR 85 PER CENT OF SCOTCH WHISKY SALES, A PROUD RECORD OF CONSISTENCY UNMATCHED BY OTHER INDUSTRIES.
Now that there is a single European market why does Scotch Whisky cost less in EC countries than in the U.K.?
A 70cl bottle of blended Scotch Whisky might sell for £10.80 in Britain.
Tax would take £7.16 or 66% of the retail price.
In 10 out of 12 EC countries, lower taxes mean that the same bottle is sold for less:
FRANCE about £9.60 (47% tax)
GERMANY about £9.20 (44% tax)
ITALY about £5.10 (39% tax)
Why do you have to pay so much for your bottle of Scotch Whisky?
The Government is the main beneficiary from the sale of Scotch Whisky
The tax take varies according to the retail price.
On cheaper brands it can be over 70%
The illustration shows a 70 centilitre bottle of Scotch Whisky selling at £10.80, of which the Government takes 66% in tax
It breaks down like this:
SENSIBLE DRINKING
MORE THAN 98% OF THOSE WHO DRINK ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES DO SO SENSIBLY AND WITHOUT HARM TO THEMSELVES.
Alcohol taken in moderation can be beneficial to health.
A number of independent research studies carried out in California, Massachusetts, Hawaii and London have shown that moderate drinkers have a lower mortality rate than total abstainers and are less likely to suffer from coronary disease.
REDUCING THE HARM
The Scotch Whisky Industry recognises that there are people whose drinking causes them medical or social harm.
It does not believe that blanket measures to reduce overall consumption, for example higher taxes or restrictions on availability, would lead to a reduction in alcohol misuse.
Instead it agrees with the Government's view, expressed in its document ‘Sensible Drinking’, that these could penalise the moderate drinker, while problem drinkers would either continue drinking to excess and deprive their families of essentials or switch to cheaper or illicit drinks.
PREVENTION
The Scotch Whisky Association and its member companies fund research and support educational measures aimed at those who are most at risk or who are best placed to influence them.
These target groups include:
Young people
Teachers
Those who drink before driving
Pregnant women
Workers in industry and commerce
Doctors, nurses and social workers
SPREADING AWARENESS
The Scotch Whisky Industry has taken a lead in establishing company policies for identifying and providing treatment for employees with alcohol problems.
More than 85% of the industry's work force is now covered by such policies.
The drinks industry circulates briefing packs consisting of audio and visual material to its target groups.
These are backed by a panel of expert speakers.
THE SCOTCH WHISKY ASSOCIATION HAS ALWAYS ENCOURAGED MODERATION IN DRINKING AND IS TOTALLY OPPOSED TO THE MISUSE OF ALCOHOL IN ANY FORM.
