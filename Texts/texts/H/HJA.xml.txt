 Dear Sir,
June 10, 1991
As per our telephone conversations of last Friday and today, I am returning herewith the faulty copy of Xtree Gold which we received from you last week.
The 3½″ disks, although labelled Disk 1 and Disk 2, are both in fact Disk 2, as a DIR check will show, and I could not install the program with them.
I could not load from 3½″ copies made from the 5¼″ sets either, as I got a ‘VERIFY’ message and only 2 of the 4 disks would load.
Yours faithfully,
Electrical Work — Student Computer Room
I attach a copy of a note from Mr G Anderson concerning the wiring of the three Amstrad machines in the Student Computer Room.
You will recall that I wrote to you in June requesting that this work be carried out, and I was given a job number (which I do not have to hand), but no date for the work to be done.
As it is now the middle of October, I do not think it unreasonable to request that some action be taken in this matter as soon as possible.

1.
Minutes of March meeting & matters arising
2.
Maintenance
1992/93 maintenance had been for file-servers, high-performance PCs, and critical laser printers only.
Four bids had been received, of which that from DCS of Edinburgh had been the lowest, at just under £3,000.
This bid had been accepted.
Ad hoc repairs would also be carried out by this local company, as their quote was also the lowest.
(All quotes retained on file by Assistant Secretary).
Network cabling and software work is to be carried out by McCall Information Services of Glasgow, Scotland's only Novell-authorised Systems House.
3.
Budget: priorities
After some discussion, it became apparent that there were some discrepancies between the list provided by DFC and the preceding list.
It was agreed that CW would discuss this with DFC on his return.
It was pointed out that the official procedure for collating Garden computer equipment bids remained within the remit of cost centre managers, who are asked to submit supplementary estimates when making their own Departmental submissions.
The Computer Users Group should not see the collation of hardware requests from end users as their primary function.
CW & DFC to discuss terms of reference for the CUG.
4.
Staffing.
GL outlined the situation regarding the appointments of a Computer Support Officer and of a scientific computing post.
A specialist recruiting agency will assist in finding suitable candidates for the CSO post, whereas the scientific post will be advertised in Nature, along with some other science vacancies.
There was some discussion on the difference in grading between the two posts.
5.
Network development strategy (Paper attached)
Accepted.
CW to add boxes for non-networked systems,

Audio-Visual Equipment
A).
Video Projector.
We have had demonstrations and quotations from three companies (Saville's, Audio-Visual Consultants, and Scotia) for this equipment.
Technical case.
Optically, there was little to choose between the Sharp and the GBI machines in terms of image clarity and definition.
The GBI machine comes with zoom lens, however, which increases portability — the machine can be used easily in lecture theatre, seminar rooms, or smaller offices — without changing lenses.
If we were to purchase the Sharp machine we would require to purchase at least one other lens, and probably two, which would require additional operator work and still not provide the flexibility of the zoom lens facility.
Cost
Other factors:
AVC is the company who supplied and maintain our lecture theatre sound system.
They have quoted for linking the projector to our existing system.
This company is well-known to us, and they know our equipment, and we are satisfied that any after-sales service work they carry out for us will be done to a high standard.
GBI machines are in use in several local institutions, including Edinburgh University, and there is a large user base with a high level of product satisfaction.
For reasons of flexibility, technical merit, and overall lower cost, we recommend purchase of the following equipment from Audio-Visual Consultants:
We recommend that this machine be kept in the Projector Room, under the supervision of S Clarke, and will be issued for use only to authorised and trained staff.
B. Computer Display Panel.
We have had demonstrations of three models and received quotes from two companies — Audio-Visual Consultants and Scotia (UK).
The 3M 4800 Panel did not meet technical requirements.
The colour reproduction was inaccurate, and the screen refresh rate was too slow, so that the mouse pointer was lost while in motion.
This would have been distracting when used in training.
The 3M 5300 Panel and the Spectra ‘C’ Panel both use Thin Film Transistor (TFT) technology.
There was little or no difference in technical quality between the systems, and as far as we are concerned the matter can be decided on price.
We recommend that the 3M 5300 TFT Panel be ordered from Scotia.
We recommend that this machine be kept in the Computer Room, under the supervision of C Will, and issued only to trained and authorised staff.

Special Notice
Computing
A Computing Support Officer has been appointed, and is expected to take up the post on 1st July.
In the meantime, the following interim support arrangements will apply:
1.
The computer fault log will be moved into the Library office.
All faults must be written in to the book by the person making the report.
Please do not phone Mr Pirrie or myself to report faults or to chase progress, as no action will be taken unless the fault has been previously recorded.
The log will be used by the Support Officer to assist in formulating policies on training needs, as well as for analysis of common hardware failures, and it is essential that all problems, however minor, are recorded.
2.
The initial contract for computer support with the University Computing Service finished at the end of April.
New arrangements are being negotiated at present, under which we will pay for call-outs on an ad hoc basis.
Please do not call the EUCS Help Desk directly, as you will be told that they cannot provide a service.
All call-outs will be made by myself at present following analysis of the fault log.
3.
Requests for consumables (printer ribbons, disks, computer paper etc.), software, and small hardware items (T-switches etc.) should be written in to the Consumables Book in my office.
Again, please do not phone with these requests.
4.
The Garden will shortly be installing network monitoring software.
This will analyse network performance, maintain equipment inventories, and log software use within the system.
Staff are reminded that unauthorised software must not be used on any of the Garden's computing equipment.
5.
The Scottish Office Agriculture and Fisheries Department have given us three Amstrad PCs, which were surplus to their requirements.
These machines, each with an attached printer, have been installed in the Student Computing/Study Room, primarily for word processing using WordStar software.
They are usable by any member of staff when not required by students.
RBG Computing
In 1986, following a report commissioned by DAFS, an Altos minicomputer was installed, primarily to manage the Garden's financial activities.
In addition, a Cromemco machine had previously been acquired to hold the Garden Records System, running under software written by an external consultant to specifications drawn up by Dr James Cullen, then Deputy Keeper.
At that time no scientific software was available for the Altos, which ran on SCO-Xenix 3.4 — a Unix dialect — and the system was used by administrative, scientific and horticultural staff mainly for word processing, and for accounts management.
The Garden had no PCs, and could not undertake any scientific or taxonomic computing.
The Library used a database written by Dr Cullen for cataloguing purposes, but because of software limitations, the system could not be used efficiently for enquiries, and it was unsuitable for processing subscriptions, loans and book orders.
The Garden had no computer communication links, so that the Library could not access on-line bibliographic databases to carry out literature searches for staff, and there was no possibility of using computers for data exchange between institutions.
By 1988 it became apparent that the lack of scientific software for the Altos system, together with the expenses which would have been necessary to upgrade the operating system and install new communication facilities, necessitated a through review of our computing activities, and a strategic assessment of the Garden's computing requirements.
The Computing Strategy Report was commissioned from Edinburgh University's Computing Service (EUCS) in 1988 and accepted in February 1989.
In the course of its survey, EUCS found widespread dissatisfaction, particularly from the scientific staff, with the limited software capabilities and operational difficulties of the Altos system.
Strategically, the Report recommended two options:
1.
A VAX minicomputer to replace the Altos.
DEC VAX machines have a large scientific software base and could also continue to carry out the accounting functions,
or:
2.
Local Area Networks (LANs) of PCs to carry out group-specific tasks, such as scientific computing, administrative functions, library activities.
The first option was costed and found to be more expensive than the Garden could afford.
Additionally, the Plant Records System would have had to be rewritten by external consultants in a fourth-generation language such as Oracle, and minicomputer versions of specialist packages for Finance and the Library, which are more expensive than networked PC versions, would have had to be purchased and tailored to our specific requirements.
The LAN option was chosen, and work began on the Computing Upgrade Project, financed by a special grant from DAFS, in 1989.
The present situation as of July 1991 is that we have three operational LANs, for administrative, library, and plant-data functions.
The largest LAN, in terms of data handling, is that which holds the Plant Records system.
BG-BASE — software written specifically for botanic garden plant records — was purchased and installed.
This database is intended to underpin our taxonomic work, as well as being used in the management of the living plant collection.
The Administration LAN has the Sun Accounts package installed, and also runs other software for financial and administrative functions.
The Library LAN, which was installed in 1991, runs a specialist library management system (Soutron) which integrates book ordering, subscription management, cataloguing, enquiry, circulation and loan functions.
Bridging between the LANs will enable interconnection where necessary; for instance financial records should be transferable between the Library's ordering system and the Accounts Department, and bibliographic data will be available to plant record enquirers.
Communication links have been established on the Administration and Library LANs for the exchange of computer data with financial institutions and bibliographic databases, and discussions are underway on the use of the JANET system for the exchange of scientific data between academic institutions.
The specialist gardens are able to access the Plant Records system through dial-up modems, and are able to use the same PCs for word processing, small databases, and spreadsheets for numerical data, such as climate records and finance.
Scientific computing is seen as having a high priority within RBG.
Many of the developments in taxonomy in the recent past have involved the use of computers, but staff in RBG have been limited by the inadequate facilities previously available, which have made it extremely difficult for them to become involved in work in this field.
The establishment of the post of Project Leader in Taxonomic Computing and Software Development, reporting to the Deputy Keeper, and the appointment of a senior person in this role, is intended to establish RBG squarely within this area, and to develop these activities in existing and new scientific work programmes.
(See also the Section on Taxonomic Computing)
Management of our computing activities is under tripartite control by the Garden Secretary, the Librarian, and the Taxonomic Computing Project Leader.
Strategic and policy decisions are taken by the Computer Consultative Group, which has a wider membership of specialist staff advising Management on computing issues, and the views of users are collated by a Computer Users’ Group, which contains representatives from all Garden departments at all sites.
Technical support will continue to be provided by EUCS, through which the Garden also has access to the local scientific computing community.
Co-operation in taxonomic computing will be carried out with a number of institutions, nationally and internationally.
The Library has fostered co-operation in information technology with the Department of Information Science at the University of Strathclyde, for the development of image databases and the use of interactive video for educational and interpretive purposes, and possible links with the Flora Europaea and British Diatom Flora projects are currently being explored.
Data exchange and collaboration on information technology between libraries has been aided nationally through co-operation between Edinburgh, Kew, Natural History (Botany) Library and other major botanical libraries, and internationally through the Council of Botanical and Horticultural Libraries.
Information consultancy and information brokerage are other areas currently being investigated.
For Staff Bulletin
Computer Support.
In order to help rationalise computer support activities, which have been rather overloaded recently, staff are asked to observe the following procedures.
Requests for consumables (ribbons, disks etc), software and small hardware items should be made only in writing, using the requisition forms which have been supplied to Department and Section heads.
These requisitions will be dealt with on a weekly basis.
Computer stationery (paper, labels) has been moved into the main Stationery Store, and is now being dealt with by Support Services.
Faults and computer problems should be written in to the Fault Log kept by the Computer Support Officer, Mr Stephen Marshall.
Please do not telephone the Computer Support Officer or myself for assistance or consumables.
The only exception will be network emergencies (i.e. network failures) which should be reported to me immediately.
Other priorities for Mr Marshall's time will be set by his line manager, in consultation with myself.
Computer Consumables
Responsibility for the stocking and issue of computer disks, printer ribbons and laser printer toner cartridges will be transferred to Stationery with effect from…
Computer stationery stocks (paper, labels etc.) have already been transferred.
Staff are asked to note the following procedures:
1.
The normal unit of issue of disks will be one or two disks per person.
If more than that number is required, requests must be supported by good reasons, and will require to be counter-signed by C Will, G Lomas or R Pankhurst.
Staff are asked to specify whether Double Density (for IBM PS/2 machines) or High Density (for newer machines) disks are required.
Issues of disks will be monitored, and those whose use appears excessive will be encouraged to undergo training in efficient disk management.
2.
Printer ribbons will be issued singly.
Staff are asked to specify the printer model when requesting ribbons, so that the correct type of ribbon can be supplied, e.g. Epson LX800, LQ550, LQ1170 etc.
Staff will normally be expected to fit their own ribbons.
Those who are unsure of how to do this will be shown, after which they will be expected to manage themselves.
3.
Laser printer toner cartridges can be ordered from Stationery only by the persons responsible for each machine.
These persons will fit the cartridges themselves, if necessary after training.
Computer Consultative Group.
Notes on meeting held 6 June 1991 to discuss contingency arrangements for computing.
1.
Mr Mowatt will be returning to Scottish Office by the end of September, but he will be free to accept suitable placement offers from Scottish Office before then, subject to RBG receiving four weeks notice.
It was also noted that Mr Mowatt has accumulated arrears of leave, so that his availability during the period of notice will be reduced.
2.
Altos File Transfers
a)
Mr Mowatt and Mr Pirrie had been working through the user directories, archiving files for retention, and deleting others as advised by users.
The hard disk is now down to 50%, and it is estimated that all non-Accounts files will be off the system by the end of June.
The Cultivated Herbarium files will be archived, for linking to BG-BASE at a later date, and no new entries will be made after then.
Dr Chamberlain's files will be similarly archived, and may be suitable for a networked Paradox database.
Mr Will offered to assist Mr Mowatt with database identification and transfer.
b)
Accounts files will remain on the system for as long as necessary, so that 1990/91 accounts can be completed, and for proving the SUN Accounts system by parallel running.
3.
Operations
a)
Altos
Sufficient knowledge and experience exists within Admin to keep normal operations going on the Altos, and to deal with operational problems as they might arise.
b)
LANs
Mr Pirrie has completed an introductory Novell course, and Mrs Lomas is considering his future training needs.
Mr Will will be learning Novell within the next few weeks for the Library LAN, and should be able to provide assistance if required from July onward.
c)
Mr Mowatt agreed to write an Operations check-list, outlining routine procedures, and how to carry them out, and listing actions needed in the event of problems occurring.
4.
User Support
Equipment under maintenance is not likely to present any problems, provided that these are correctly diagnosed.
In the case of individual PCs and printers, each case will have to be treated on its merits.
Limited diagnostic software is available for disk problems, but otherwise machines will have to be taken to the LTSS Glasgow office for diagnosis and estimating repair costs.
We may have to bring in assistance from outside to deal with specific problems, and Mr Whittaker's network of contacts could be used for this purpose.
Mr Pirrie will be the contact person in user support, and his actions in each case will be determined by a protocol which Mrs Lomas will prepare.
Members of the Group, and others, can provide some support to users, but it is essential that each request for assistance should be noted centrally, so that a record of problems, and actions taken in response, can be built up.
User support for software problems can be provided in-house for word processing, Works, and DOS.
Increased training could help in this direction, and it was agreed that Mrs Gregory should be asked to conduct Word 5 courses.
Mr Will would help on Works, and Miss Hamlet and Dr Alexander would be given instruction in DOS, including the EDLIN text editor.
It was agreed that it would be reasonable to expect the new computer person to have some contribution to make towards solving our current problems.
Dr Walter will be visiting RBG shortly for other reasons, and will advise on BG-BASE problems.
Now that the new network connections have been made, it will be possible for Mr Mowatt to prepare a network diagram, showing the position of each piece of equipment on the system.
Mr Mowatt agreed to proceed with this.
He also agreed to provide hardware documentation to Mrs Lomas, detailing when each item was purchased.
(Ideally, each item should have an attached history, showing modifications and repairs).
Mr Mowatt reported that the current problem in the Packing Shed had been reported to LTSS, who were considering what action might be appropriate.
Mr Mowatt agreed to look into current printer problems — three laser printers are now unable to print £ signs after installation of font cards.
The paper size problem with Plant Records is likely to be partly software-related, but Dr Chamberlain agreed to check the dip-switch settings, particularly for ‘Skip-over perforation’.
Mr Mowatt agreed to ask Mr Lawrie to fit a spacer between the cupboards in the Garden Supervisor's office and the network connection.
5.
System development.
It was agreed that no system development (new network connections etc.) could be undertaken in the interim.

2.
PC Allocations.
CW reported on allocation of new machines and re-allocation of replacements, arising out of agreements at the last meeting.
Group agreed that this was one of its management functions, and that it is the appropriate body to make such decisions, since its membership ensures the Garden's overall computing needs are considered in a balanced way.
Group to issue a reminder to staff that project-funded computing equipment still requires Group approval, in view of the needs to maintain compatibility, and to monitor support and consumable costs.
CW reported that Brazilian group consumable costs will be approximately £200 p.a.

CW asked about Engraving machine re-location, in view of need to make decisions on network cabling routes.
IL reported on latest position.
DM raised H Sluiman's request for evaluation of Reference Manager software.
Agreed that one copy of this should be purchased, along with a copy of EndNote, for competitive evaluation, which would include input from N Gregory.
Question of absence backup for H Hamlet — NTR.
JF to raise again at GMG.
CA queried insurance position re portable PCs taken overseas on official business.
GL advised that this is covered in Garden's general insurance.
CW reported on maintenance contract re-negotiation.
Computing Sub-Group
Minutes of meeting held 24 March 1993
Present:
1.
Minutes & Matters arising.
Engraving machine — monitor fault reported.
CW to contact DCS, as PC is under warranty.
GL advised that Braille font now needed for Gravograph.
DC & CA had received requests from external institutions for labels to be made.
Agreed that their exact requirements should be clarified and detailed cost schedules should be prepared, as this seems a reasonable source of income which would not conflict with the current work-load.
Herbarium label programme under active development.
Bar-code labels — NTR, material under test.
CW intimated he wishes eventually to move to bar-coding of Library stock to facilitate loans, and the same technology will suffice for both Horticultural and Library purposes.
2.
Operational Report.
CW reported on successful installation of software on new Admin file server.
The operation had shown the need for Admin staff to have better front-end menus for logging-in, as the existing workstation shells are memory-intensive and time-consuming.
CW to add this to a list of jobs which DCS to carry out in the near future.
Problem with tape backup system will necessitate switching two Model 30s between Finance and Computer Room.
CW to draw up a list (attached) of new machine allocations and resultant re-allocations.
Group did not support GD, HD and AD suggestions that they retain Model 30s in addition to the new machines.
It was felt that other requirements had priority.
Staff in these Departments considering additional computers are at liberty to submit suggestions through line management in the usual way.
3.
Policy on laser printers.
Group agreed that laser printers were uneconomical and unnecessary for normal correspondence, and that their use should be restricted to areas where presentation quality is needed, for preparation of near-camera-ready copy and for documents distributed to outside bodies, such as commissioned Reports, etc.
4.
Policy on computing facilities for Associates.
Group agreed that the over-riding priority on the allocation of computer equipment is to serve the needs of RBGE staff working on approved activities, but that where affordable, and assuming this will not conflict with that priority, Associates should be provided with appropriate computing facilities.
The allocation of computing facilities within the Garden remains a matter for RBGE management, i.e. members of the Computing Sub-Group, who report to Management Group.
It was agreed that for the moment one Model 30, re-allocated from (2) above, will be provided for pool use by all Associates, to be sited in the room set aside for Associates.
5.
Request from Mr J Main.
See paper derived from (2) above.
D Mitchell also advised to discuss his database requirements with M Pullan and D Mann.
It was suggested also that it would be useful to provide staff with a note describing the range and capability of some of the specialist software now installed on garden PCs.
CW to draft a note for Vitis, pending development of specific communication media for computer users.
6.
AOB.
IL advised that the new telephone system is operational.
Following discussion of the new legislation on Health and Safety of workstations, it was agreed that £5,000 should be transferred from Computing Budget to Estates specifically for the purchase of chairs, screen filters, footrests and document holders to meet EC Regulations.
CW to provide IL with a list of requirements, arising out of the assessment.
CW to discuss the regulations on eye and eyesight testing, and other employee information and training entitlements with M Prior.
A job description for a Computer Support Officer is to be agreed between GL & DM.
The appointee will work to M Pullan, under R Pankhurst's overall supervision, with input from GL and CW as necessary.
The Group noted that M Pullan had already started to provide some elements of user support on databases, documentation and network problems.
It was agreed that he should be asked to join the Group as from the next meeting.
DC presented a review of the current position re BG-BASE.
It was noted that a new version running under Advanced Revelation is likely to be launched in June 1993.
The need for a continuing dialogue with K Walter was stressed.
Following the recent Whitley Council meeting, DC agreed to chair an open meeting of the Computer Users Group in the near future.
The first meeting would concentrate on users’ views, with an opportunity for CW to elaborate on the IT Review.
The NUS paper presented to Whitley led to the Group's decision to allocate two re-assigned Model 30s for student computing use, as per item (2) above.
The Group did not support the informal suggestions put forward by Staff Side Whitley that a) there should be a ‘Whitley’ representative on the Group — it felt that this function could be adequately provided by more frequent, regular and open meetings of the Computer Users Group.
It must also be pointed out that the Sub-Group is a sub-group of Management Group , and its functions are to advise Management and to put into effect Management policy on computing issues.
The Group will continue to welcome suggestions from staff on computing matters, which can be raised through any of the members or through the Users Group.
Mr Scott's second suggestion, b), that the Garden should create and staff a new post of Computer Manager, was felt to be unnecessary at present, since the Computer Support Officer is the person who will be carrying out most of the tasks outlined by Mr Scott.
The Group feels that horticultural computing issues are becoming increasingly important at all levels, and that input from a horticultural representative at all future meetings is in the Garden's best interests.
Accordingly, it was agreed that JF should be asked to provide a substitute if he cannot attend meetings.
Following on from this, the Group had a wider discussion on the BG-BASE software provided to maintain records of the Living Collection.
It was felt that Garden staff would benefit from an increased awareness of the capability and functions of the system.
There are needs for RBGE-specific end-user documentation; for high quality training of all users and potential users to be provided at the appropriate standard and level; and for demonstration seminars to be arranged on specific issues.
These would make use of the display panel which is to be ordered 1993/94.
It was agreed that the procedures for data entry would be looked at over the next few months, and further discussions would be held in due course.
DC reported that the hard disk on the Science server is likely to reach full effective loading (allowing for switching space) within the next twelve months, and that the IT Review recommendation for replacing this server may have to be brought forward.
It was agreed that the situation be kept under review.
The up-grade to the Apricot will be ordered in April.
RP suggested that the next meeting should discuss policy on laptops and palmtops.
CA reported that the Olympus lap-top had had to be returned to suppliers a second time, due to a defective mother-board.
CA is taking part in discussions with Edinburgh University regarding finance for MSc computer facilities.
Ideally, one per two students should be the aim.
CW reported that, during discussions at the specialist gardens, YBG and LBG felt that they would like the facility to handle and update their own records on their own equipment, with batch mode updates being sent to E on disk.
The technical implications of this proposal will be investigated during 1993, along with developments in communications between and within gardens.
COMPUTER SUPPORT OFFICER (AO)
There is a vacancy in the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh for a Computer Support Officer (CSO) at Administrative Officer (AO) Grade (Current Salary scale…)
The CSO will work across all Departments within the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh and will be responsible for initiating, organising, providing and monitoring user support for all aspects of computing work.
The CSO will be responsible for the provision of a support service to all RBGE staff for problems with word processing and some other software, and for routine hardware problems, including printers.

NUS Representatives.
Thank you very much for letting me see your paper in draft.
I see no problem in your raising this at Whitley, but I hope I may be able to answer some of your specific points in advance, without in any way prejudicing your right to raise this in Committee.
1.
I agree with you that the level of computer provision for students is inadequate.
I have argued consistently that the level of computer provision for all groups working here is below acceptable levels, and Computing Sub-Group and the new Planning Unit for Information and Central Services will continue to address these issues in the years to come.
2.
The recent draft IT Review, on which any and all views were canvassed, did not result in any comments on computing in the Horticultural Training Programme.
I would encourage you to read it and let me have your views as soon as possible.
I would ask you to note in particular that the Review envisages 7 PCs being available to horticultural student by the end of financial year 1994/95, together with the appropriate software and peripheral equipment.
3.
One of the Model 30's in the Computer Room has a faulty mother-board, and the cost of repair would be prohibitive.
We plan to replace this machine when funds become available some time in 1993/94 with an upgraded machine.
4.
We plan to install one of the ‘Amstrad’ draft printers so as to provide some draft printing capability as soon as possible, and to consider further the possibility of replacing the heavily-used Epson printer next financial year.
5.
You will have noted that the Computer Support Officer has resigned, and, until a replacement is appointed, we will continue to have problems with the fault logging and consumable requisition systems.
Edinburgh Journal of Botany: Bibliometric analysis.
1.
Contents.
Volumes 47 (1990) and 48 (1991) together contained 42 papers, publishing 745 pages (excluding book reviews etc.)
34 papers (81%) were taxonomic or floristic.
There were 60 authors, of whom 29 (–50% by number) had RBGE affiliation.
On a page count basis, the proportion of RBGE affiliated authorships is much higher.
585 pages (79%) had some RBGE affiliates as authors, and a weighted count (number of pages x %RBGE authorship) gave a figure of 557 (75%) RBGE affiliate authorship.
10 papers (25% by number) were 5 pages long or less.
10 papers (25%) were 20 pages long or greater.
2 papers (35% by length) occupied more than 100 pages.
It is suggested that the extremes of page lengths indicate confusion over the objectives set for the journal, between the publication of short communications and monographic articles.
Memo to: Dr D Mann
From: Colin Will
Date: April 9, 1992
Performance Indicators
1.
Establish the ranking of EJB in comparison with other taxonomic journals.
Since none of these appear in Journal Citation Reports, this would have to be assessed by a combination of factors:
a)
Circulation figures.
b)
Spread of circulation (establish internationality).
c)
Count of papers/year.
d)
Count of pages/year.
e)
Journal-to-journal co-citation clustering (identifies those journals highly cited by other journals).
2.
Establish the proportion of internal/external authors in EJB.
3.
Assuming staff publications list in Quinquennial Report accurate, establish proportion of internal/external publications by staff, & determine proportion published in highly-ranked journals (from 1).
4.
Citation count on staff publications, differentiating between EJB papers and others.
5.
Author co-citation mapping to identify networks of researchers and influences.
The above research could be carried out in EML using Biosis & Science Citation Index on CD-ROM.
(I can't justify the very high costs of these services in-house).
I estimate that it would take about 2 months using ½-day of my time per week.

Management Group
E-mail and the Internet
The transfer of information between computer systems is at the heart of our current computing strategy.
Within the Garden, most machines will soon be connected together using a Local Area Network (LAN), to share software, data, and resources such as printers and plotters.
E-mail offers the chance to reduce the amount of paper moving between staff within RBGE, and the Strategic Plan for Information Services envisages us making increasing use of this facility for internal communication.
Connections to the specialist gardens and to external computing services are presently limited to:
1.
Online access to Chessington payroll services by a fast, dedicated modem and a kilostream line in Personnel;
2.
Online processing of some payments via the Royal Bank's Royline service, again using a dedicated modem link;
3.
Online access to bibliographic databases via the Library's slow modem and X-28 dial-up facility;
4.
Again through the Library, access to Edinburgh University's computing services, including the EDINFO system, University and National Library catalogues and some other libraries.
5.
Theoretically, access from YBG and LBG to BG-BASE via dial-up modems (which have never worked efficiently).
Whereas 1 and 2 above are interactive, 3 and 4 do not permit us to transfer data from other computers, or to allow external computers access to our data files.
We would like to have access to the UK's JANET system, which allows access and file transfer between computers nationally and internationally, to the BIDS information service, to the OCLC bibliographic data files for catalogue conversion, and to international information systems, to facilitate co-operation, collaboration, information and cost-sharing between institutions.
We would also like to establish a functional and efficient method for connecting our systems to the specialist gardens.
The Internet is a system for connecting computers together.
It operates internationally, and crosses the divide between academic and commercial computer traffic (previously JANET would not allow charging for access to commercial databases using its facilities).
1.
E-mail
Use of the Internet already involves the use of e-mail software for routing messages, so that this can also be used for internal communication.
There are several systems on the market, including Lotus ccMail, Microsoft Mail, and many others.
Of those which have been recommended or demonstrated, Pegasus Mail is used extensively within Edinburgh University, and appears to meet all of our requirements.
It is available at low cost as shareware.
Additional software would be required for workstations.
Other Internet features include the following:
2.
TELNET
This allows the user to log in to distant computers, e.g. Missouri or Canberra Botanic Gardens, to see whatever these sites will allow us to see.
3.
FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
This allows us to send and receive files (as distinct from but including messages) between computers.
These files can be text, data, images or programs.
Files can be compressed, to save costs and time, and decompressed after receipt.
Botanical centres available for FTP via Internet include Kew, Missouri, Canberra, Harvard, and IOPI.
The Flora of China is already an Internet user, and other collaborative floristic projects are extremely likely to become users in the immediate future.
4.
USENET
This feature allows for the creation and operation of international discussion groups and bulletin boards.
They are organised to allow the users choice over what to see, in the correct time sequence, and to post their own contributions.
Some subject specialists have worked out their own way of using such systems, for instance many molecular biologists post sequences onto these networks rather than writing or publishing.
The auditing systems ensure control over priority and authorship.
The facility includes bulletin boards which provide information on hardware and software updates and bug corrections, including access to updating services such as WATCOM C and AREV, which would be extremely useful to RBGE staff.
5.
Search aids
include FINGER, for ‘telephone'-type enquiries, i.e. finding the e-mail address for the person or institution you want; GOPHER, a system of linked menus to help find resources anywhere in the Internet; ARCHIE, which allows searching indexes to remote computers to find out which of their searchable files are of interest to you; WAIS, for searching remote databases; and WWW (World-Wide-Web), which is similar but which uses an extremely user-friendly full screen with hypertext features.
From scanning the ‘Whole INTERNET Catalogue’, the following available subject categories would appear to be highly relevant to our activities: Agriculture, Biology, Computing, Environment, Forestry, Geography, Geology, Libraries, Molecular Biology, Weather.
Members of the Computing Sub-Group have been in discussion with a number of specialists, to establish the desirability and practicality of connecting to the Internet , and some attended a demonstration in Edinburgh University recently.
Several members of the Group are convinced that connection is essential to facilitate the development of our scientific and information systems over the next ten years.
It may be regarded as an infrastructure element for the movement of information, in the same way as roads and railways control and permit the movement of people and goods.
The efficient two-way transfer of information between ourselves and external systems can be seen to underpin all of our scientific activities, most of our public information functions, and a great deal of our internal records management.
Whereas the additional funding allocated to IT in the current financial year will enable us to install the necessary capital equipment, connection to the Internet will involve the payment of annual subscription charges to Mercury and EUCS, for which no provision has been made in the Computing Recurrent Expenditure budget.
The sum is dependent on the choice of the particular hardware options — speed of line, capacity for data transfer, expandability — and current estimates are between £4k and £10k p.a.
Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh
IT Review, 1992
Draft for consultation 
version date (November 27, 1992)
1 Introduction
The Garden now has about 80 PCs, used by approximately 100 staff, about half of the total workforce.
A large proportion of this equipment was obtained as part of the Computing Upgrade Project (1989-90), which will not be further reviewed here.
Subsequent purchases, network cabling and other services have been provided in response to demands from individual Departments.
It is now felt that a complete review of our IT activities is necessary, in order to plan our future investment programme.
2 Present Position
The initial batch of PCs obtained in 1989 were IBM PS/2 Model 30-021 machines running at 8MHz with the 8086 chip, 640Kb RAM, 20Mb hard disks, and 3½″ 720Kb floppies.
These were purchased on price and availability, to provide the largest number of users with a standard machine for basic word-processing, which had been identified as the major requirement for Garden users.
Since the initial batch was purchased, machine specifications have improved, costs have come down, and user requirements have changed, diversified, and become more demanding.
These trends are likely to persist within the next five years, and necessitate a continuous review of the IT market-place, and mechanisms to ensure that Garden staff are using the most cost-effective IT in pursuit of Garden priorities.
The predominant use is still for word-processing, but databases, spreadsheets, graphics, and specialist packages are assuming increasing importance in most Garden Departments.
The commonest peripheral devices are undoubtedly printers, with the majority being dot-matrix types, including some letter-quality machines.
Recently, bubble-jet and laser printers have begun to be installed, where the former's quietness and the latter's high quality output were major factors.
Other IT equipment includes fax machines and modems, for external communications; scanners for data input; a microfilm camera linked to a reader-printer by a computerised retrieval system; a PC-driven engraving machine for garden labels; a plotter for CAD (computer-aided design); a CD-ROM drive in the Library.
Almost half of the PCs are networked, using Ethernet cabling and Novell Netware, running from one small and two large file-servers.
These servers run specialist packages on an inter-connected network, for Science (BG—BASE and other databases), Administration (SunAccount and other software), and the Library (Soutron Library System).
Apart from within Finance Section, few of the printers are networked.
The biggest single limitation in our current capabilities is the slowness of operation of the PS/2 model 30s as network stations, and their lack of memory for some high-performance software, such as the PANDORA database system.
As stand-alone workstations for routine word processing they remain perfectly capable of meeting most normal requirements, but we have identified a number of work-groups who would operate more efficiently with higher standard machines.
Another significant limitation is the difficulty of printer sharing, since not all of the machines are networked.
3.
Part I — Garden-wide issues
3.1 Computer management
The Computing Sub-Group is responsible to Management Group for the co-ordination of computing practice and strategy, and for the provision of advice on policy.
A small executive panel consisting of the Garden Secretary, the Head of Taxonomic Computing, and the Librarian takes such day-to-day decisions as may be necessary, in line with agreed policy.
The Computer Users’ Committee reports to this Sub-Group.
From 1993/94, the planning of computing expenditure will be undertaken by the Information and Central Services Planning Unit, within the Garden's planning cycle.
The Computing Services budget will be presented with other corporate activities in an Annual Plan, and expenditure will be controlled by the Garden Secretary as part of the Director's Office operational activities.
Capital expenditure on IT equipment and facilities (including cabling) will come from the Capital Equipment and the Capital Buildings and Works budgets, which are controlled by the Estates Officer.
Staffing consists of a Computing Support Officer (½-time AO), plus part of the time of the Taxonomic Computing Officer (SO).
No further staff increases in this area are envisaged — existing scientific, horticultural and administrative staff are developing skills to handle many different hardware and software tasks.
3.2 Accommodation, Health & Safety
In 1992 the European Commission (EC) is publishing Health & Safety regulations for working with Display Screen Equipment.
These regulations are mandatory , and cover technical specifications for radiation output, screen glare, etc., and also human factors, such as chair design, room lighting and ventilation and equipment layouts.
All new ‘workstations’,(defined as any furniture and equipment used by or in the presence of a user, together with the immediate environment in which the work is undertaken), have to comply with the regulations from January 1993 onwards, and all existing ‘workstations’ will have to be modified to comply with the Regulations by 31 December 1996 at the latest for less heavily-used stations.
By the end of 1996, therefore, we will have to ensure that all of our equipment meets EC standards, and that we have acquired furniture designed to the approved specifications.
Probably more than half of our VDU operator chairs will meet the standard, but we should urgently check all workstation environments using the standard EC/HSE assessment forms.
All PCs bought from 1992 onwards will meet the technical standards, but we should check the older machines.
Anti-glare screens require to be fitted where needed, and some layout changes will be necessary.
A costed implementation plan should be produced by the end of January 1993 for inclusion in the Information and Central Services Strategic Plan.
Costs: £150.00 per new chair
Schedule: Checking — complete by end 1992
Implementation — 1992 — 1996
3.3 Security
The computer equipment now installed represents a considerable financial investment on the Garden's part, and it is essential that the investment be protected.
The most expensive items of equipment at present are the file servers, which are kept in secure store in the Computer Room.
Security is an overall office function, and the Computing Sub-Group, in its earlier discussions on security, has preferred to deal with it by ensuring that offices are kept as secure as possible, rather than by guarding individual pieces of hardware.
For equipment which is in peripheral parts of the site, however, special provision should be made.
The possibility of insuring certain items should be investigated.
Software integrity has been addressed by the phased installation of anti-virus software on all PCs, scheduled to be completed by the end of 1992.
3.4 Computer Training
Wherever possible, in-house training should be provided, since this reduces costs, develops training expertise, and ensures that training is tailored to our own needs.
Improved educational technology (see section 4.4.7 below) should be acquired as soon as practicable.
Members of the Computing Sub-Group have considerable expertise in a variety of computing skills, and it should be possible to identify individuals from this Group who can provide training, in addition to the Computer Support Officer.
Training skills need to be built up, sustained and improved to provide a secure platform of well-trained users.
3.5 Hardware
The total number of potential users can be estimated by counting the number of scientific (s.l.) and administrative staff, and Garden staff at Garden Supervisor and above, plus operational staff involved in maintaining Garden Records, plus facilities provided for DHE students, externally funded posts, attached external researchers and long-term visitors.
A preliminary estimate suggests a likely ceiling of between 120 and 130 machines.
We currently run about 80 PCs, and our purchasing policy should combine new acquisitions to reduce sharing and spread workloads, with upgrades and replacements.
Research contracts should include costs for the provision of computing services wherever appropriate.
At present we do not have a detailed inventory of computing hardware.
Such an inventory should be compiled by the end of 1992, to include location, responsible officer, machine specifications (including add-ons), date of purchase, cost, network card address, repair costs and other features.
This database could be networked using proprietary network management software or other systems.
Repair costs for older equipment tend to increase, at the same time as costs of more powerful replacement machines are coming down.
Demands for faster processors with larger memory to run newer applications software are increasing.
The lifetime of workstations will generally be between three and five years.
The Garden's initial batch of 34 IBM PS/2 Model 30-021 should therefore be replaced by the end of 1995.
Those still in working order can be used for straightforward word-processing as stand-alones, with some being held in reserve to replace machines out on repair, plus some being made available for the use of Associates and long-term visiting researchers.
Repair estimates are now routinely provided before work is authorised.
Eight machines per year should be upgraded from April 1993 onwards.
Specifications for replacements should be agreed annually, since costs and technology are changing so rapidly.
Included in the additional machines should be a small number of portable machines, to be booked out to staff who must unavoidably work away from base for periods.
Schedule: Inventory end 1992/93
Replacements 8 p.a. from 1993/94 to 1998/99
Additional PCs — 10 p.a. from 1993/94 (not all core-funded), to total 130 by 1998/99
Costs: £24,000 p.a.
(Capital)
The modifications to file-servers should extend their lifetime and capability to the end of 1996 at least.
The network topology is such that new file-servers can be plugged in at any time should the need arise.
SCSI cards can also be fitted to increase disk storage capacity, but the level of demand for graphics work suggests that a specialist graphics station (Sun work-station or equivalent) is likely to be needed by 1994.
A router or intelligent switch will be needed when the network cabling is extended in 1995/96.
If we require a GIS station associated with floristic and biodiversity studies, then this too should be a Sun station (or equivalent RISC-based machine), linked to a colour scanner and colour plotter.
The Science server should be replaced in 1996/97, and the Administration server in 1997/98.
There is no need for these machines to be identical, however, and it is likely that the Science one will be the larger, as software demands increase.
1996/97 Science server £8,000
1997/98 Administration server £6,000
Graphics station 1993/94 £3,500 — 5,000
Router: 1995/96 £2,000
The operating systems used on these PCs should continue to be DOS-based, with Windows where applications demand it.
The Computing Sub-Group should monitor developments in OS/2 and Windows NT operating systems to ensure that advantage can be taken of any significant developments in these systems.
Graphics stations generally use Unix, but upgraded Netware can handle applications running under both systems, in addition to Mac software.
The numbers and types of printers have increased rapidly in the last three years, but we would not expect any rapid increase in numbers in the next three years.
What we do expect is a rationalisation of printer use, through printer networking and the installation of print-server software on the network.
This particularly applies to the laser printers, which should be made available to all users requiring high-quality output, subject to departmental priorities and security arrangements.
These increases in capital expenditure have recurrent cost implications for repairs, maintenance and consumables.
The maintenance contract is likely to increase to £5,000 p.a. by the end of 1993/94, with additional repair costs on non-maintained equipment running at a further £3,000 p.a. (average 15 repairs) in the same period.
Close monitoring of disk usage, together with improved training in file management, must be introduced as a matter of urgency.
Workstation back-ups by portable tape drive will be possible from late 1992, and this should eliminate the need for large numbers of floppies to be kept for hard-disk back-ups.
3.6 Software
Analogously to hardware, we do not have an accurate software inventory.
We must ensure that we are operating in full compliance with the legal requirements of our software licenses.
We must also check that software used on RBGE equipment is virus-free, is being used for official purposes, and that we are using the most recent versions.
The audit should take place at the same time as the hardware inventory is being checked, and a relational database should be constructed to link the two inventories together.
Schedule: end 1992
Some software lacks documentation appropriate to its users.
The BG-BASE reference manual is no substitute for a users’ guide to our particular application, and it is essential that such a guide be written by the end of 1993 at the latest.
Other bespoke software, such as PANDORA, should also be provided with documentation.
The documentation should be written by Taxonomic Computing staff, with input from the Computer Support Officer in his training role.
Schedule: end 1993
3.7 Network
Our current network strategy is that we are running a single Ethernet composed of three segments from three servers (Science, Administration, Library) linked by thin Ethernet through repeaters.
To improve network performance, a higher-capacity ‘spine’ should form the main cabling run, linking all three servers through 16- or 32-bit network cards, and including a router and network management software to optimise performance.
The present thick Ethernet cabling outside the main building has too many tight-radius bends, which cause packet collision errors.
Additionally, in many areas it runs parallel to power cabling.
It is also subject to RF interference from nearby electrical machinery.
The main spine cabling should be replaced by optical fibre cabling, which has much higher data transmission rates, is more flexible, and is electrically safer.
This work should be carried out in phase with the building work for the Herbarium/Library extension, at which time thin Ethernet drop-downs should be installed in all new offices and existing offices where needed, together with the additional repeaters to run the system.
The aim should be to have hard-wired network data connections in close proximity to all potential computer users.
The timing of investment is dependent on the schedule for the Herbarium/Library extension, as the re-cabling should be done as part of the fitting-out work.
Additionally, to enable a link to be established between the new Visitor Centre at the West Gate and the SunAccount system, either optical fibre cabling or a line-of-sight microwave link needs to be in place by 1994/95.
Optical cabling: £20,000
Repeaters: 5,000
Router 2,000
Thin cabling: 8,000
The system should run Version 3.11 of Novell's netware, to improve memory use; speed up traffic flow; reduce errors; and make back-up, restore and print server utilities more efficient.
This version will also enable us to network the Garden's Mac computers, the proposed graphics and/or GIS Unix workstations (see below) and other non-DOS environments.
1993/94 Netware 3.11 (100 user): £5,000
1994/95 Projected Netware 3.2 upgrade £2,000
We currently lack network documentation for hardware and software, and we do not even have a schematic showing the network connections.
A topological diagram of the system will be part of the computer inventory to be provided by the end of January 1993.
3.8 Communications
The current telephone system is at capacity, and additional lines cannot be installed without upgrading the system.
At the same time, the new digital system — ISDN2 — offers the possibility of using the same lines for either telephone or computer communication.
Workstations with modems could then access the national and international computer communications system.
In particular, we would want to use such a system for connecting the specialist gardens and the nursery to the plant record system.
(dates) £25,000
An X-25 gateway has recently been installed to link Payroll with the Chessington Computer Centre.
The Payroll operation is particularly sensitive, and although it would be desirable to have only one X-25 link for the organization, the demands of security, and reduction in cabling costs, suggest that an additional X-25 link be established in 1993/94 through one of the file-servers, so that any networked PC can use it for external communications.
The X-25 link should also be used to connect the specialist gardens with BG-BASE and other systems, although all will need faster PCs with additional memory and higher speed modems to use X-25 efficiently.
This link should also be used to connect to JANET, Internet, and other international Wide Area Networks (WAN).
At present we can access JANET only as a registered user of Edinburgh University's system, although the Library can also use Internet through British Telecom's DialPlus X-28 service.
To become a JANET site in our own right would cost approximately £10,000 initial registration fee, but this would give us complete control over the security and budget of the communication system, for the free exchange of non-commercial information between research institutions, which is not currently possible.
The demands of multi-site projects such as the EC-funded Rhododendron project, and the Darwin Initiative, make it imperative that we install these systems as soon as funds are available.
1993/94 would be technically achievable.
JANET license £10,000
X-25 PC & gateway 2,500
We should be using e-mail for internal communications much more widely than we do at present, in order to reduce the amount of paper we currently distribute, and to send specific messages to individuals and groups.
An internal bulletin board would be used by the Library for bibliographic services, and by Computing to send out technical bulletins.
Workgroup software should be evaluated also.
Micromail or Workgroup software site license £1,500
4 — Part II — Departmental/Sectional IT
4.1 Science & Technical Services
4.1.1 Taxonomic Computing
The initial phase of taxonomic computing work will be in the fields of standards development, and the production of saleable software products.
PANDORA should be in a marketable state by the end of 1993, and a database should be produced to enable a revised Index of Collectors to be published by the end of 1995.
New IT is dealt with in Section 3.2.1.3
4.1.2 Flora writing
Floristic research will involve word processing, database systems, graphics, image databases, desk top publishing, and a geographic information system (GIS).
Whilst most of these areas are dealt with elsewhere, the GIS is a new item which will require considerable investment.
It is recommended that a consultancy from local specialists in Edinburgh University Geography Department should advise on the most appropriate system to meet our needs.
The costs of such systems are extremely variable, but are likely to fall somewhere in the regions of:
GIS station 1995/96 £5,000 — 10,000
Colour Scanner 1995/96 £2,000 — 5,000
Colour Plotter 1995/96 £15,000 — 30,000
ARC-INFO software 1995/96 £3,000 — 5,000
ORACLE DBMS front end £3,000 — 4,000
Because this equipment and software is expensive and sensitive, the choice of location should be made very carefully.
The system should be networked, so that individual items, such as the plotter, can be made use of by other staff using different software, e.g. garden design, Estates, Publications, etc.
4.1.3 Image analysis and image databases
We now have on order an entry-level image analysis system, consisting of a PC with a large disk (1 Gb), frame-grabber, video camera, and software for analysis.
This should be regarded as a prototyping system, primarily intended to meet the requirements of our microscopists.
The longer-term aim remains to create a system which will be able to handle as much as possible of our image data, including Photographic and Library resources.
The technology should be proved, and expertise gained, between 1992 and 1994, by which time we should aim to commission the higher-level system to use in applications such as visitor centre information points, educational use of videodisks or other IT media, and to integrate image information into our plant information systems.
The prospects for external funding include possible joint commercial development with publishing and/or media interests.
1992/93 £10,000
1994/95 £30,000 — £50,000
4.1.4 Scientific & Technical Services
Given the very recent appointment of a Head of Scientific & Technical Services, it has not been possible to formulate the likely requirements for laboratory computing for 1993/94, but discussions during 1993 will enable us to plan this work from 1994/95 onwards.
No major investment will be involved until the building of the new Research Block, but we should purchase a PC during 1993/93 for the Head of STS.
4.1.5 Photographic records
Field specification for a slide library database was agreed between Library and Photographic Departments in 1992, and the BG-BASE ‘IMAGES’ file was modified to accommodate these specifications.
Following this, the IMAGES database was evaluated for slide library cataloguing and for the Library's illustrations index.
Whilst it would be desirable to integrate information on our illustrations resources, it must be said that in its current incarnation IMAGES is too cumbersome and complex for data input, and is unacceptably slow for search and retrieval.
Further software evaluation will be carried out in 1993, to include proprietary systems.
4.2 Horticulture
4.2.1 Plant Records
Significant improvements in efficiency would be obtained by upgrading all machines used for data input and data query.
A factor of three on input would result from the replacement of Model 30s with 386 machines.
This is not recommended, however, as the industry is rapidly moving towards 486 as the standard, high-performance chip, with the down-rated 486SX for entry-level machines.
A six-fold (at least) increase in speed of operation is possible with 486SX chips.
There is a need for three higher-performance machines (Plant Records, Potting Shed, Arboretum Department), which should also have a higher memory specification.
By comparison with SQL-based DBMS's, such as Oracle, Ingres, or Informix, Revelation is extremely slow in enquiry and output modes, and no amount of machine upgrading will overcome this problem.
Some form of client-server architecture, where queries are processed on the server before being delivered to the client machine, rather than the present system where transactions are dealt with sequentially, exchanging input and output continually between server and workstation, would help.
An SQL module is available for Advanced Revelation (AREV), but its introduction would involve major modifications to BG-BASE, over which RBGE does not hold development rights.
4.2.2 Horticultural Training
There are now 3 Model 30s and 3 Amstrads available to students, with printers for the three Amstrads and one of the Model 30s.
The original requested provision for students was one machine per two students per course year, making 7 in all for about 42 students.
This should be achieved by 1994/95, with at least one of the machines being a higher-performance network station.
Higher quality printers should be acquired for the heavy-duty work involved in printing out student theses in the third year, and for printing out graphic output from garden design software, which should be purchased from 1993/94.
Horticultural Training staff should be involved in the specification, evaluation and use of the educational technology equipment outlined below.
4.2.3 Edinburgh garden
We should acquire portable dataloggers for data collection in the Edinburgh garden in 1993/94.
These should be used to prove the technology, with a view to introducing them in the other gardens between 1995 and 1997.
1993/94 £4000
1995/96 £4000
1996/97 £4000
Plant labels have caused a number of difficulties in recent times.
The label engraver is inappropriate for temporary labels, and a number of patchwork suggestions have been made to overcome these difficulties.
It is suggested that a barcode system for labels is the only practicable way forward, and the Garden should invest in the barcoding software and printing equipment as soon as possible.
1993/94 £3,500
The use of software for garden design will be introduced to Horticultural Students within 1993/94.
Such software offers add-ons such as modules to estimate quantities, labour costs, and labour schedules.
Horticultural staff should evaluate such systems to see if they could be used to help in the efficient deployment of the Garden's workforce.
The costs of these systems vary according to the complexity of the requirements, with entry-level systems being available from about £2,000.
Systems including AutoCAD cost between £8,000 and £16,000.
1993/94 Evaluation
1995/96 £2,000 — £8,000
The Nursery should be connected to BG-BASE using ISDN2 in 1993/94.
4.2.4 Specialist Gardens
The specialist gardens have experienced difficulty in linking to BG-BASE.
This link was extremely slow, involving a Model 30 at each end, linked by a modem and Carbon Copy Plus software to the server.
In the immediate future, faster PCs at the gardens should link via faster modems directly to individual network cards on the Science server through ISDN2 telephone cabling.
This system should be installed in 1994/95.
Existing Model 30s could then be used exclusively for word processing.
1994/95 PCs £4,000
Mop Modems £2,000
The major IT requirement at the specialist gardens is to service information points within visitor centres.
(See below)
4.3 Library
4.3.1 Library management package
The main alteration to this system will be the acquisition of the MARC interface module, which will enable us to import bibliographic data from external sources in standard UK MARC format.
This will improve data compatibility with other institutions.
Hardware upgrades within the Library will form part of the overall Strategic Plan.
1993/94 £1,500
The major difference to the user interface will be the full introduction of OPAC (online public access catalogue) so that all networked PC users will be able to access the Library catalogue.
Plans for the Herbarium/Library extension envisage one additional staff workstation for circulation, and two additional OPAC stations, one of which will also run the Library's CD-ROM drive.
Costs: £3000 (schedule dependent on building programme)
The Library's loans system will be computerised during 1992/93, and printed circulation lists for journals will be produced from 1993 onwards.
The full Serials system will be operational from early in 1993.
Among the new services to be offered by the Library are a Library Bulletin, which will contain notes on significant new accessions, news items, notes on ‘missing’ volumes, and focuses on holdings in particular subject fields.
This Bulletin will be paper-based initially, but should go on to an e-mail bulletin board as soon as this is available.
The Acquisitions Librarian will liaise with the Computer Support Officer on the DTP involved.
4.3.2 Bibliographic databases
The Monograph Index will be scanned into an ASCII file during 1993, for conversion into a format compatible with Soutron Library System.
The MARC module will do the conversion.
4.3.3 CD-ROM services
Index Kewensis is reputed to be going to appear in this format at some imminent future time, but there are many other bibliographic databases currently available as CD-ROMs.
Unfortunately, these are very expensive, and the limited use made of online search services makes the trade-off between online and CD-ROM very uneconomic for the Garden, compared to larger library systems.
We have, however, recently contributed towards the purchase by ECTF of the CABI ‘TREES’ CD-ROM, which can now be accessed by all RBGE staff at the Darwin Library.
Similar co-operative purchase schemes are being investigated between the libraries of RBGE and SASA (formerly SOAFD East Craigs) through the Scottish Agricultural Librarians Group (SALG).
The CABI ‘PEST’ database is an obvious first contender for such a purchase.
Other SALG members have expressed an interest in exploring similar possibilities.
The Library's CD-ROM drive will be networked using drive mapping software.
1993/94 £1,500
4.3.4 Online services
Online services currently available are DIALOG (for BIOSIS, SCISEARCH and other databases), ESA/IRS, and the European Community's ECHO system, for access to the CORDIS database.
Use made of these facilities has been minimal up to now, largely because the technology had not been made available to RBGE staff before 1990, and scientific staff were not aware of the possibilities.
New staff, M.Sc.
students, and external researchers, are likely to increase the demands for literature searching using online databases.
4.3.5 Microfilming
With the acquisition in 1992 of a microfilm camera linked to a reader-printer by means of retrieval software, RBGE has a powerful facility for conserving archival documents, whilst making the archives more widely available.
The purchase of this equipment also ensured that we did not need to convert a room to provide a separate Archive Library in future building development.
The system also has the potential for filming Herbarium sheets, thereby earning income from the sale of film, whilst reducing loans of irreplaceable original sheets.
External funds are being sought for the filming and indexing work.
1993/95 Filming work: 25,000 p.a.
Indexing: 10,000 p.a.
4.3.6 Information science research
Research in bibliometrics and in bibliographic software (hypermedia etc) will continue on a limited scale.
The acquisition of a Library Macintosh specifically for the development of Hypercard databases and for other Library housekeeping software is recommended for 1993/94, having been deferred in each of the two previous years.
1993/94 £2,200
4.4 Directorate, Administration and Central Services
4.4.1 Director's Office
The Director's Office and senior management require management information systems to monitor and plan RBGE activities, and to model structural and financial options.
Such systems receive input automatically from financial, personnel and other software, and link to report generators.
The database software should be introduced in 1993/94.
4.4.2 Finance
The SunAccount package is powerful, flexible and has the potential for growth.
In-house training should be given to staff in other departments who require access to financial and inventory information.
4.4.3 Business Development
[Corporate Plan Part 2]
4.4.4 Personnel/Staff Training
The X-25 gateway to link Payroll to Chessington has been found to demand more or less exclusive use of a fast, large-memory machine.
Other software such as SAGE Payroll should therefore be mounted on a separate machine.
The proposed transfer of the Library's Wyse 486 machine to run non-dedicated Netware 2.2 will solve this problem in 1993/94, as SAGE can be run in foreground without significant loss in network performance.
Personnel staff should continue to evaluate specialist software, with a view to introducing a system in 1993/94.
Costs: £5,000
4.4.5 Publications
Considerable investments have been made in equipment for DTP and publication graphics from 1989/90 to 1993/93, but the staffing to take advantage of these systems has only increased by one half-post in the same time.
The demands for text-processing are likely to increase, as the diversity and number of publishing projects increases, and it is hard to see how the present staffing level will cope with the likely workload.
An additional half-post should be found from 1994/95.
Scanner technology, linked to graphics software, offers benefits in handling illustrations for publications, and Publications should make use of the colour scanner currently used by scientific staff.
High-level training in DTP for the Publications Officer should be provided in 1993/94.
4.4.6 Graphics
At present, the only graphics capability is with the Public Services Graphics Officer, running the Apple Mac.
At the same time, scientific staff have no access to graphics software on the Garden's other PCs, and are making increased use of the Graphics Officer's time on routine text-processing for presentations through the Mac.
We should acquire simple DTP software for PCs, for DIY use by scientific staff.
Those preparing or using illustrations for publication should be trained in computer graphics, to spread the expertise as widely as possible.
1993/94 Express Publisher £150
1994/95 Quark Express for DOS £500
The scanners should be used more for capturing line drawings for input to our large-scale DTP set-up.
No additional expenditure on hardware or software is needed.
4.4.7 Education
Included in educational technology should be presentation graphics programs (e.g. MS Power Point) to produce 35mm, OHP slides, and posters for presentation.
Initially, the output should be produced by agency from computer disks, but if requirements should increase, for example for the M.Sc.
course and other staff lecture programmes, we may find it cost-effective to purchase the output hardware some time after 1996.
1993/94 £500
4.4.8 Estates
The existing Administration file-server, due for replacement in 1992, would form a good platform for Estates computing, running AutoCAD and the new Maintenance software.
A memory upgrade is required, but the hard disk is sufficient for the foreseeable future.
A small plotter is being acquired, but if this machine is networked, access to the proposed colour plotter will be possible later.
PSA Projects have transferred copies of RBGE plans on microfiche to Estates, and the new microfilm equipment installed in the Library has been used to make hard copy when required.
4.4.9 In-house presentation facilities
The facilities available for in-house training, external education, and small public demonstrations, are extremely limited.
We should acquire a PC display panel for training in 1993/94, and a video projector in 1994/95.
These facilities should be portable, for use in rooms ranging from the Lecture Theatre to a small seminar room, which should also be equipped with standard facilities, such as flip-charts, video monitor, OHP etc.
In the meantime, we should hire such systems in whenever necessary, to familiarise staff with the technology.
A number of local companies hire such equipment.
1993/94 Display panel: £2,500
1994/95 Video projector: 8,000
4.4.10 Exhibitions
The permanent exhibition demonstrating the scientific and horticultural work of the Garden should include an element of interactive display.
If systems for visitor information and botanical interpretation can be introduced and prototyped here, this will save money on their development for visitor centres later.
The possibilities range from display panel technology with a Presentation Manager programme driven by menus, to full interactive video displays.
The simple system would be relatively easy to develop, and the equipment should in any case be obtained for other uses, such as in-house training.
4.4.11 Visitor centres
Visitor centres at each of the gardens should include information points to provide visitors with continually revised presentations describing our global and garden-specific work; and enquiry services linking to internal information, the Library and to Plant Records and other databases.
The links may involve microwave or satellite communication in the medium to long term.
The presentation technology should be a mix of interactive (hands-on) and passive systems (video & PC-driven displays).
Members of the Computing Sub-Group require additional familiarisation with this area of IT, so that informed advice can be provided to Management.
4.4.12 Reception
Reception staff should have access to a database containing information on Garden events, basic Garden information, and staff skills and specialisms.
Training in such systems, and an in-depth induction programme on the work of RBGE staff, should be provided for reception staff, This would reduce the number of routine enquiries handled by senior staff, while ensuring that specialist enquiries are routed to the most appropriate staff.
Given that the Reception area is likely to be severely disrupted by the intial phase of building work for the Herbarium/Library Extension, this provision can be deferred until 1995/96.
4.4.13 Stores
Stores are currently linked to the Inventory function of the SunAccount package.
No change is envisaged in the immediate future.
4.5 Non-core funded groups.
4.5.1 SAPS
The current phase of SAPS work is scheduled to finish by the end of 1993, and it would be inappropriate to discuss future proposals here, save that no major additional IT items are envisaged.
SAPS staff would welcome access to better educational facilities, including a small seminar room equipped with PC display panel, video projector and the other educational technology recommended above.
4.5.2 Other attached research workers
Externally-funded posts should always come with funding for the provision of computing services.
Proposals should be carefully worded to emphasise that our costs are for the provision of services , rather than equipment, whose ownership could be the subject of later discussion.
4.5.3 Services to visiting research workers
We should provide, within the Herbarium, bookable PCs for visitors to use for word-processing.
These PCs should be linked to the network, to allow for BG-BASE access.
Herbarium bench fees should be set to include funds for the use of these facilities.
One PC per year should be acquired for this purpose between 1993/94 and 1995/96, making three available in total.
Networking should be carried out along with Herbarium/Library extension work.
1993/94 £1,200
1994/95 £1,200
1995/96 £1,200
5 Executive Summary
The most urgent priority is for a system inventory, to assess workstations in accordance with Health and Safety regulations, to compile network documentation, and to account for the Garden's hardware and software.
Cabling upgrading, allied to netware improvements, will provide a secure basis for all future network requirements.
This should be seen also in the context of improving communications within the Garden, between gardens, and between RBGE and external information resources and services.
A phased programme of expenditure on equipment replacement and additional machines should be emplaced.
New IT initiatives should include a geographical information system, improved graphics data processing (including image analysis and image databases), and investment in educational and presentational IT, including display panels and a video projector.
In-house training should be improved and built upon, using some of the new educational aids recommended.
Existing staff should be trained in the provision of training to others.
The workstations used for data input to the Plant Records system need to be upgraded, using faster machines with higher memory.
After this and cabling improvement work, attention should be directed towards increasing software efficiency.
Documentation for this system, and for PANDORA, is urgently needed.
Bar-coding of Garden labels should be given a high priority, allied to systems for on-site data collection.
Visitor centres and other areas of public contact should use IT to make efficient use of staff and resources, and to establish new methods for keeping the public informed and educated.

Information Technology (IT) Review
Before the Garden invests further in computer equipment, cabling, and other IT equipment, the Computer Management Group is to advise Management on our existing IT situation, and to provide plans for the logical development of computing and other IT facilities.
Among the issues to be considered are:
1.
Changes in provision arising from strategic plans;
2.
The effects of staff relocations and building work;
3.
The use made of existing equipment and software;
4.
Problems and difficulties experienced with existing equipment;
5.
Desired improvements;
6.
A forward look at projected IT needs, and an information management strategy for the future.
A wide-ranging consultation exercise is an essential part of the Review, and I shall be taking advice within the next few weeks from individuals (non-computer users included) as well as from the Computer Users Group.
Laser Printer Order
The requirement is for a high-resolution (600 dpi) laser printer for graphic images and text.
The new HP Laserjet 4 fulfills all the specifications, and is the only laser printer on the market to meet the specifications at a reasonable price.
It is recommended that we purchase from Action Computer Supplies, our usual printer supplier, who has the lowest price that I have seen for this printer at the moment.
Our customer number (please quote) is 878977-445
Details:
Networking.
LTSS came back to Keith yesterday with a request for an official order for the network points and cabling, which they said they could carry out next week.
Finance have now said that there may not be enough money left in computing budget to cover this order.
In view of the fact that we can't proceed with the move of Plant Records room until this work is carried out, and more importantly, Jim Mayes can't access the stock control package within SunAccounts, could you please look into the financial aspects.

Research Management Group
Library databases.
The Library currently produces the following card-based bibliographic services:
1.
Monograph Index.
All incoming journals are scanned for taxonomically significant papers, which are then indexed under the family or generic name.
Cards are filed in catalogue drawers, in a sequence separate from the main catalogue.
UMBELLIFERAE
BURTT, B.L.
(1991)
Umbelliferae of Southern Africa; an introduction and annotated check-list.
Edinb.
J. Bot., 48,(2), 133-282
The above reference would only be retrievable by family, not by author or geographical distribution.
The inclusion of cryptogamic entries distinguishes this index from the published Kew Record of Taxonomic Literature, and the convenience of knowing that all entries are represented in the Library makes this index very useful to staff, despite its limitations.
Cards are typed by Typing Pool from slips hand-written by Serials Librarian.
It does not include books.
2.
Rhododendron Index.
This is an author listing of references to Rhododendron, produced from scanned articles and additionally including Rhododendron references from the Kew Record.
Special stationery is used for this index, and no subject indexing has been undertaken — retrieval is impossible under anything other than first author.
Cards are hand-written.
3.
Analytical catalogue entries.
This index is interfiled with the main author and classified card catalogues, and contains a variety of different subjects — floristic works, papers by staff, botanic gardens, topical subjects, papers on staff research programme interests.
This index is thus multi-functional, combining current awareness with archival enquiry-answering functions.
Cards are typed by Typing Pool from slips hand-written by the Serials Librarian.
Retrieval is by author or class-mark — no subject headings or taxonomic indexing is undertaken.
ST CLAIR, Larry L.; NEWBERRY, Clayton C.; & NEBEKER, Glen T. (1991)
Catalog of the lichens of Utah.
Mycotaxon, 40, 199-264
FLV bsh [Class-mark]
WOLF, P.G.; SHEFFIELD, E.; & HAUFLER, C.H. (1991)
Estimates of gene flow, genetic substructure and population heterogeneity in bracken (Pteridium aquilinum).
Biol.
J. Linn.
Soc., 42,(4), 407-423
FMV [Class-mark]
In the above two examples, entries would be retrieved under first author and under class-mark.
Cards are thus equivalent to entries for books in the main card catalogue.
4.
Biographical Index.
This is a separate card index sequence prepared from obituaries and other biographical papers retrieved during journal scanning.
Cards are hand-written directly by Serials Librarian.
5.
Illustrations Index.
This index was started by Herbarium staff, who scanned new journals and books coming in to the Library.
Cards are hand-written directly.
It was suggested that Library staff could take over this function, since they are scanning the journals in any case, and the work would lend itself to the eventual creation of an image database, but Library staff shortages have made it impossible to undertake this work systematically.
There are many more good illustrations coming in to the Library than there are analytical entries or other index terms.
Future options.
The installation of the Library's computer package means that all cataloguing functions are carried out on-line.
This means that enquiry is now possible under authors (ALL authors), corporate authors, titles, series, subject headings (from a thesaurus being compiled on-line), and class-marks.
From September 1991, no new cards will be inserted for new books.
Currently, records back to 1986 are on the system, and retrospective cataloguing will be carried out from data picked up at the loans desk when books are issued, so that we will have records for all material in current use.
We may eventually be able to scan the existing card catalogue and generate full records for older stock, but this is a long-term possibility.
I need to be advised on what to do with the existing indexing services — should they be integrated with BG-BASE fields or with the Library system?
(It is my intention to make the Library's catalogue available on-line to all PC-users within RBGE).
I don't want to duplicate effort in keyboarding the same bibliographic data twice, and I'd like to avoid using two separate systems for data input.
I'd prefer to treat the current-awareness function separately, and prepare a monthly bulletin, using the Library package, based on staff research interests.
I'd also appreciate advice on the usefulness of the current services, and on additional bibliographic services not being provided.

Computer Management
In reply to your memo of 7 Oct, for which I thank you.
I think we have answered 2a, and we will supply a printer when funds become available.
As I understand it, I thought I had identified a printer which Marisa could use pro tem, but I believe there are interface problems which Stephen is working on.
Re Constabulary, I am afraid that, as I have explained to Inspector Murray, we have no more funds available this financial year, and his request will be considered within the planning cycle next year.
As a suggestion, could I ask you to consider whether Constabulary could share the Heather/Sally machine when they are not using it?
I don't know how much machine time they would need on a daily basis, but if it's just for updating files, I can't imagine it being very extensive.
Just a suggestion.
Cheers

Executive Summary
1.
Information is a resource to be managed, in the same way as we currently manage manpower, financial, and physical resources.
All RBGE staff have a role to play in information provision and management in fulfilment of our statutory objectives.
2.
Our information services will benefit from longer-term planning than the current annual estimating cycle.
A stable financial platform is essential for the strategic planning of information services.
3.
The development of internal communication systems will increase efficiency by sharing information, thus reducing waste and duplication of effort.
4.
The Library will continue to invest in information technology to make more of its resources available to its users in a cost-effective way.
5.
The collection of historical Archives, including photographic archives, requires urgent conservation action, to be followed by action to make the material more widely available in a secure way.
6.
Our image information is an under-used resource of enormous potential value for scientific research, public enquiries, and commercial development.
We should invest in the technology needed to make these images accessible and usable.
7.
The major thrust in taxonomic computing should be to create a Herbarium database, incorporating image data, with ancillary programs for Herbarium management.
8.
Computer-aided design facilities should be made available to Garden Departments, including the Horticultural Training programme.
9.
Enquiry services can be made more efficient by the use of information technology by well-briefed staff in contact with the public.
10.
Exhibitions should interpret and promote our scientific activities, with an annual major theme.
Planning should be undertaken in rolling three-year cycles.
11.
Our advertising and other promotional activities should be targeted at specific groups.
In-house graphic design and copy preparation (desk-top publishing) should be supported.
Timescale for main proposals
1 Introduction
RBGE's information resources are held in several different physical locations, administered by staff in different departments.
No integrated view of the position of information services within RBGE has previously been attempted.
There is scope for considerable improvement in the provision of these services and for the introduction of new services currently lacking, through the use of information technology, and more importantly, by the adoption and implementation of sound information policies throughout the organisation.
This Report focuses on some of the immediate problems, and suggests some possible solutions, but it must be emphasised that no single component of RBGE can hope to deal with all of these issues.
What is needed is an acceptance, in all departments and at all levels within the organisation, that the efficient provision of accurate, up-to-date, and relevant information — internally and externally — is one of RBGE's most important priorities.
Information should be seen as perhaps the most fundamental of RBGE's primary assets.
1.1 RBGE objectives
A common factor in the strategic planning of information services in many outside organisations is that such plans derive from, and constantly refer back to, the organisation's business or scientific objectives.
As stated in the National Heritage (Scotland) Act of 1985, the Board of Trustees is charged with the following duties:
a)
to carry out investigation and research into the science of plants and related subjects and disseminate the results of the investigation and research;
b)
to maintain and develop collections of living plants and preserved plant material, books, archives and other related objects;
c)
to keep the collections as national reference collections, and secure that they are available to persons for the purposes of study;
d)
to provide advice, information and education, in any manner which seems appropriate to them, in relation to any aspect of the science of plants or of any related subject;
e)
to provide other services (including quarantine) in relation to plants, and
f)
to afford to members of the public opportunities to enter any land occupied or managed by the Board for the purposes of gaining knowledge and enjoyment from the Board's collections.
Objective a) requires the provision of information resources to underpin the research effort, and implicitly provides for our function as a publisher; b) explicitly mentions the library and the archive collection; c) implies the efficient curation of information, and the granting of access to the resources; d) specifies our enquiry, consultancy and educational functions, all of which have a high information content; e) demands the use of expertise and data for the provision of specialist services, and f) relates to our public amenity function, and sets out the purposes for which access to the amenity is provided.
All of our institutional objectives have a bearing on the information resources of RBGE, and on the ways in which these resources are used to the benefit of staff, researchers, garden visitors, and the wider community.
1.2 Information resources
The resources comprise several large and well-known collections of data, such as the library, computer databases and the photographic collections, and many other less obvious databanks, such as staff knowledge and specialisms, together with the methods by which the information is accessed, used, stored and disseminated.
1.3 Information policies
We can use guide-lines on information policies to set priorities, choose appropriate technologies, manage our resources efficiently, and monitor their operations.
Within the framework of the Garden's overall statutory objectives, information policies will help us to decide on resource allocation, improve the way we communicate with each other and with our ‘users’, and provide feedback to Management and the Trustees on the way our resources are being used.
1.4 Information management
We have tried to discover how information is acquired, recorded and stored; how it flows through the organization; and what is done with it.
We have identified some areas of weakness, and others in which we believe that the investment of resources will substantially improve the way in which we present ourselves to the public, and provide services which we are currently unable to undertake.
1.5 Principles
We suggest that the following principles should underlie the development of our information policies for the future:
1.
There should be the maximum degree of interconnection and compatibility between information resources.
(We want, for example, computer systems which can exchange data between each other ).
2.
The information resources should be secure and permanent.
Part of the value of our major resources, such as the Library, Herbarium, and the living plant collection, is in their sheer size and variety.
They should be kept together in one place, as far as possible, as separation would reduce efficiency.
They must never be broken up for short-term gain.
3.
Access to the information resources should be as simple as possible.
This applies both to physical access, and to the technology needed to use the resources efficiently.
4.
External users of our information services should pay for usage in proportion to the additional costs incurred in making the resources available to them, if judged appropriate.
This would not apply, for instance, to reference use of the library, where public use qualifies us for a discount on book purchases, but would apply for, say, postal loans of slides, commercial enquiries, online searches, photocopies and so on , where such services would use staff time and involve paying for resources which we would not otherwise have to buy in.
5.
As far as possible, the policies adopted for the management of our information resources should be independent of the actual information technology needed for their use.
We recognise that our resources are different in nature and serve different purposes, and that whilst computers may suit one use, paper records are better for others.
We must not again get into the situation where the working of our Garden Records system was dependent on keeping an obsolete computer going well past its normal expected lifetime.
1.6 The Report — Methods and Description
This Report is divided broadly into two parts — those dealing with ‘internal’ information services, and those whose major impact is on Garden visitors and other users.
The major ‘internal’ information resources within RBGE have been identified as the library and archive collections, the photographic collections, computer systems, publications, scientific and horticultural data collections, staff expertise, and administrative data.
‘External’ or ‘visitor-related’resources include the enquiry, staff-contact, educational, interpretive and exhibition services, which are mainly provided for visitors or other external users.
It is recognised that there is no rigid division between these categories (the library and photographic services are used both internally and externally, for example), but for convenience they have been dealt with separately in this Report.
Individual members of the group prepared contributions within their own specialist areas, and these studies form Appendix A. Subsequent analysis using information science techniques resulted in the preparation of three matrix tables (Appendix B) which match each resource against its uses, major users, and the information management tools applied in each case.
It was immediately clear that the weakest area was in information management, where major improvements are needed in order to exploit and make available to staff and public the large and complex information resources present within RBG.
Appendix C contains some advertising and promotion options.
Appendix D is a background paper on computing.
For reasons of economy, copies of these Appendices have not been circulated — they are available in the Library.
2 Internal services
2.1 The Library.
The bookstock currently consists of 75,000 volumes, of which 3,000 are pre-Linnean, and 3,000 are illustrated works.
These special categories, forming a substantial part of the collection, present special difficulties because of their age, condition and value.
The Library currently receives approximately 1,500 journal titles, and holds about 120,000 volumes of current and lapsed titles.
The Illustrations Collection, or ‘cuttings file’, contains some 250,000 items, most of which are botanical illustrations, with some 20,000 being original artworks in need of conservation.
This collection is arranged by family, sub-filed by genus and species, but it is not indexed or listed in any way.
It has not been systematically updated, and nor have the names.
An historical archive collection of 20,000 documents is housed in inadequate conditions, and is unindexed.
There is an already large microfilm collection, including microfiche herbaria.
Work has started on developing a video collection.
Techniques used to manage the information contained in this resource include manual catalogues and indexes, and a manual loan and circulation system.
Manual records for serials (periodicals, journals) are inefficient and wasteful of staff time.
Services currently provided include enquiries (staff and public), manual records derived from scanning journals, and on-line database searching for staff.
2.1.1 Policies
The Library's information policy will concentrate on:
1.
eliminating weaknesses in our current information management, e.g. by increasing access to the information resources, and by improving user facilities;
2.
improving physical storage conditions for archives, illustrations, reprints, artefacts, and other non-book materials; and
3.
introducing value-added information services with tradeable potential, such as image databases, optical/electronic publishing, interactive video, and collaborative online botanical information services, for which there is an external market.
The newly installed networked library package will improve efficiency in the areas of book ordering, financial management, catalogue access, subscription control, loans and circulation, and in providing staff with improvements such as accessions bulletins and current-awareness services.
The areas in which we are weak are the specialist indexes, where we provide library users with analytical indexes to biographical, taxonomic, current awareness, illustrative, and other scanned literature related to their current work.
We are also very weak in the ‘image-data’ field, where some quarter-million pieces of image data are unindexed.
The current-awareness and activity-supporting services are critically dependent on the supply of information from staff as to their current needs, and on strategic information from management as to scientific, educational and horticultural priorities.
In the past we have not always had sufficient feedback, or sufficient advance notice of policy changes, to provide these responsive services.
The Librarian has sought and received advice from the Research Management Group as to the value of these services, and now that he is a member, this valuable communication channel should greatly assist in tailoring the Library's bibliographic services to meet the needs of research staff.
The Library Advisory Committee also helps by providing a forum for the interchange of ideas between library staff and users in all Garden Departments.
In the longer term, strategic planning reviews will ensure that the Library can modify its services in support of whatever strategic objectives the Garden wishes to implement.
Because half of the Library's budget represents payment in advance for subscriptions for the following year, it is extremely difficult to make savings in the current year when financial pressures are exerted.
The situation which has applied in two out of the last three years, when percentage cuts or hold-backs were applied across the board by Management, is incompatible with the special factors involved in Library financial management.
It is accepted that our journal list should be kept under continuous review, but the Library costs are actually below average for UK plant science research institutions (Royal Society/SEPSU Policy Study ), and should be protected against short-term financial exigencies.
It is estimated that a modest increase from the present 1.8%, to 2% of total institutional expenditure, would enable us to maintain the services at their present level for the next five years.
The Librarian wishes to plan expenditure each year in three-year cycles, in collaboration with Management.
2.1.2 Communications
The installation of the remaining parts of the networked library package was part of the Garden's 1989-90 Computing Upgrade, but was delayed until mid-1991.
We plan to develop links to enable Finance staff to access the financial parts of the package directly.
We also intend bridging to the other main RBGE network, so that Garden staff in Edinburgh, Dawyck, Younger, Logan, and other potential external sites may access the library catalogue, and so that we can provide library users with access to the plant record database.
The National Library of Scotland, the University Library, the Kew Library, and other external institutions, should also be able to access our library catalogue online.
Protocols for permitting access should be drawn up (E and K Chief Librarians are working on this), and technical advice has been obtained from Edinburgh University Computing Services and other sources.
This work should be jointly funded and managed by Library and Computing Departments, in support of general RBGE objectives.
2.1.3 Archives
The historical archives collection, whilst now in reasonable physical condition, and in ‘primary-sort’ order (principally by the Regius Keeper at the date of the correspondence), is unindexed.
Access is physically difficult and inefficient, and excessive handling will cause physical deterioration in time.
The room which houses the material is totally unsuitable for use as an Archive Research Room.
The Library is unable to provide adequate security and supervision for the use of archival material, and each time an item is removed for consultation there is the potential for damage, loss, or misfiling.
All of these problems could be overcome if the Archives were to be microfilmed and indexed using a Computer Aided Retrieval (CAR) system.
Searching is made more efficient, printing of copies on plain paper is cheap and very easy, and the material could be consulted within the Library itself, thus avoiding the need for the designation of a new Archive Room within the proposed Phase 2 Herbarium/ Library development.
The microfilm equipment would be available for other uses within RBGE, e.g. microfilm copies of Herbarium type specimens could be produced, for sale or loan to other institutions.
Document image processing (DIP), using optical disks, is an alternative being considered for the archives.
There are cost and technical problems with existing DIP systems, and microfilm is currently the preferred option.
There would be no technical problems with eventual migration of fiche images to a full DIP system at some time in the future.
Microfilm has a level of user familiarity, and allied to a printer which can produce good quality prints at low cost on plain paper, should be acceptable to most users.
Estimated cost £25,000
Estimated manpower 1 year, ALIB grade (or assistance from Friends)
2.1.4 Illustrations
The Illustrations Collection contains almost 250,000 sheets of varying quality and utility arranged systematically.
It is unindexed and totally unresponsive to name changes and revisions.
Additions are therefore difficult to manage, and there has been no attempt to keep the collection up-to-date.
It is housed in vertical files which are of non-standard size, and which are no longer manufactured.
As a consequence, the files are falling apart.
As well as illustrations clipped from duplicate journals and books, the collection contains large numbers of original artworks, which are unlisted and unidentified.
A preliminary estimate suggests that there may be as many as 20,000 of these, including many by Roxburgh and Wight which are taxonomically critical.
These original works should be separated so that individual indexing and conservation can be carried out.
They also, together with other non-copyright or RBG-copyright illustrations, could form the basis for a marketable service, providing clients with colour-printed copies for publications, designs or in answer to enquiries.
It is proposed that this collection should be sifted, and the contents scanned and stored electronically on optical media.
We should introduce such systems within the next five years, and we need to purchase the necessary hardware and software soon, in order to begin the evaluation and development phases.
An entry-level system, with built-in development potential, has been planned in co-operation with the GEAC computer company (one of the largest in the field).
The project would also include the Slide Collection, current input from journals received in the Library, a proposed image database for diatoms, and Scanning Electron Micrograph (SEM) images of rust fungi.
Some of these services have the potential of attracting income for RBGE, and should be discussed with the appropriate marketing specialists.
Future developments could include scanning and storing Herbarium sheet images on optical disk, but this is a much larger project, and would have to be carried out in co-operation with other institutions, perhaps with European Community funding, as this would be at the forefront of information technology.

Estimated cost £37,000
Estimated manpower 3 man-years
2.1.5 CD-ROM
The Library has installed CD-ROM on a workstation attached to the Library network.
The Index Kewensis will be available in this form, and other databases (CABI, BIOSIS) are already available on CD-ROM.
This technology hands control of the searching back to the searcher, without the need for a member of the Library staff to act as an intermediary.
It is desirable that this equipment is linked to a stand-alone PC in the short-term, as there are technical difficulties in networking CD-ROMs.
(See also 2.3.1)
2.1.6 Library databases
The development of other Library-based databases in place of, or supplementary to, existing analytical indexes, was dependent on the Garden appointing a computer scientist with considerable expertise in database design.
Now that we have such a person in post, we will wish to explore the potential for the creation of new Library databases.
No additional costs are foreseen, as this is part of the remit of the new Computing post.
2.1.7 Educational Resource Centre
In collaboration with the Garden's educational services, we should create an educational resource centre, for use by teachers undertaking courses or attached to RBGE for particular projects.
The centre should include teaching materials (books, films, videos, audio-tapes, artefacts) which could be used to develop teaching skills and methods in communicating our environmental and conservation objectives.
The material would also be used by our own educational staff within their educational programmes.
2.1.8 Bibliometrics
The Librarian has carried out information science research in the field of evaluative bibliometrics — the use of data derived from publication and citation measures to influence research policy-making.
The continuation of this research should be supported in a modest way, and should be broadened to take in studies of botanical research.
In particular, studies of taxonomic botany theses in the UK and elsewhere could lead to the publication of lists of such works.
It has been shown that such listings have a substantial effect on the way in which previous research is used.
2.1.9 Interactive Video
The Garden has the potential to develop initiatives in interactive video, through contacts established with a number of botanic gardens and university departments currently researching or introducing similar projects.
The technology can be used to produce interactive educational and interpretive programmes, integrating text, graphics, and still and moving video images.
Advice on hardware is being obtained from external sources at present.
It is desirable that the systems we develop in-house should be compatible with those in use elsewhere.
These programmes must emphasise that scientific research is our highest priority, and they should be developed to convey knowledge derived from plant science research in interesting and innovative ways.
Other hardware and software would be shared with that acquired for other projects.
(See also 2.3.1)
Estimated initial costs: £8,000
Five-year cost £20,000
2.1.10 Co-operation.
Co-operation with other institutions on the exchange of information by electronic and other means, and on the evaluation of IT to attempt to ensure compatibility is seen as desirable.
To this end, the Librarian has discussed with the Chief Librarian at Kew (Miss S. Fitzgerald) the formation of a Forum of Botanical Information Services where such matters can be harmonized.
2.2 The Photographic Collection, and other Visual Records.
This consists of about 40,000 slides, and a large (and uncounted) number of photographic negatives — modern and glass-plate — together with a number of plates.
There is no complete record of photographs used in publications, and there is no index or catalogue of the collection.
The physical state of the material in storage is unsatisfactory, and, in the case of the glass negatives, requires urgent action to identify conservation needs.
We recommend that this work is carried out during 1992.
The historical collection is of great value to researchers and publishers working on plant collecting, biogeography, and other historical research, but it is separated from the documentary archival material held in the Library.
It is recommended that the collection be administratively integrated with the main historical archives in the Library by 1995.
This will facilitate listing, future conservation action, and research.
Photographs and slides held by members of staff also include some material which is legally (under the 1988 Copyright Act) the property of RBGE, since the photographs were taken while the member of staff was on official duty.
No means of identifying such material exists.
We recommend that steps are taken to bring this material under the control of the Photographic Department.
2.2.1 Conservation problems.
Proper registration, conservation assessment, and conservation, storage and monitoring of the complete RBGE historical negative collection with the advice of the Photographic Section is urgently required.
There is an urgent need for better archival storage facilities.
Estimated cost £20,000.
2.2.2 The Slide Collection
The present set of slides has several different functions.
It is a loan collection for RBGE staff, and for some external borrowers, and it also serves as a permanent Reference Collection of RBGE images.
These two functions are not compatible.
A reference function means that the material should not be lent out.
Additionally, some of the slides are of below-standard quality, and are not suitable for a reference collection.
It is recommended that the loan set should be transferred to the Library by the time building work commences on the Herbarium/Library extension in 1993.
(It will have to be moved at this time in any case).
At the same time, Photographic Department should be responsible for the creation, maintenance and growth of a permanent reference slide collection in suitable storage conditions.
The process will include editing, so that sub-standard slides can be identified for replacement by new photographs when possible.
Modern storage systems will be introduced to improve retrieval, and a new computer-based labelling system will enable captions and additional information to be printed on the slide mount.
This system should be acquired by 1993.
Library staff will co-operate in the production of a computer catalogue, and in the eventual integration into an image database.
Estimated costs £10,000
2.2.3 Video Collection
Videos are currently held within several departments.
To avoid duplication, and to encourage access, a central register of videos should be maintained by the Library, which is building up its own collection for staff use.
Work can start on this immediately.
2.3 Computing
The Garden's computer facilities consist of a mixture of stand-alone and networked PCs.
There are currently three main Local Area Networks (LANs)— for specialist Plant Records, Administration, and Library software.
Additional equipment includes communications hardware, scanners and a plotter.
The strategy adopted gives us a very flexible base for future computing requirements.
Software development, especially in areas such as taxonomic and other scientific computing, has been a major area of weakness, where we definitely lacked in-house expertise prior to the appointment of a Taxonomic Computing specialist.
Current budgeting arrangements have made it difficult to plan for systematic upgrading, replacement and improvement.
The new management structure, under which the Garden Secretary, Librarian, and Taxonomic Computing specialist work as a management panel, will ensure that executive decisions can be discussed and implemented quickly and efficiently.
Developments are likely to be firmly based on the existing network structure; upgrading individual elements, extending the network, and improving communication facilities.
We recommend that most desktop PCs should in time connect to a single Ethernet network, with appropriate security for sensitive data, such as Personnel records.
Improvements in management information systems should parallel improvements in scientific computing.
We need to implement a rolling programme of equipment upgrading and replacement, recognising that the life expectancy of computer equipment is of the order of five years.
We should therefore aim to replace eight PCs each year from 1993 onwards, with the priority being the network machines, so as to improve performance.
Replaced machines, if still serviceable, can be used as stand-alones to spread computing facilities to fill currently known and likely future gaps.
The cost of the replacement programme will be between £12 and £15,000 per annum from 1994, unless inflation rates vary greatly in the intervening period.
New machines should include colour graphics as standard.
2.3.1 Scientific Computing
A background paper (Appendix D) describes some of the limitations of conventional floristic and monographic writing, and outlines some of the ways in which computing can assist in conducting scientific research in these areas and in making the scientific information thus obtained available to ourselves and to others.
Image Database Development
RBGE holds a very large quantity of unorganised image information, in the Herbarium, Library, Photographic Department and laboratories.
These data would, if converted into an image database, provide our own staff, external researchers, and the general public, with a wealth of new possibilities for the future, for flora writing, image analysis for taxonomy, publications, visitor information and in many other areas.
Section 2.1.4 details a proposed project for piloting the creation of an image database which could begin in 1992, if funds were to be made available.
The first consideration would be the choice between digital or analogue systems for data capture and storage, since the hardware required would be fundamentally different.
An informal group consisting of R. Pankhurst, C. Will, D. Mann and S. Helfer is currently investigating these options.
Other software
Geographical information systems (GIS) integrate distribution, gazetteer and environmental data, and should be used in support of floristic and monographic work.
Importing data using these systems will save money by reducing the amount of background reading and literature searching needed, and by cutting costs of map and overlay printing for specific areas.
It is essential that flora writers should make contact with external GIS providers, so that we can choose a system which will be related to their own needs.
Evaluation of GIS hardware (digitisers, computers, plotters) and software should begin in 1992, and a decision on in-house versus contracting-out will be possible by the end of 1992.
Expertise in the use of statistical software will be needed, and will require to be spread more widely, for the future development of taxonomic information systems.
Techniques new to RBGE, such as numerical taxonomy, cladistics, and cluster analysis, make novel demands on staff trained in classical taxonomy, but if this kind of work is seen as desirable within the Science Plan, we must initiate and plan a programme of staff development and training in taxonomic computing in 1992.
Statistical techniques form the basis of rule-based information systems (‘expert’ systems, or ‘knowledge-based’systems).
Such systems as PANKEY have development potential, both as high-level identification aids for professional taxonomists, and for use by visitors, particularly if linked to image databases.
RBGE should support the development of these systems.
Taxonomic Information Systems
The Taxonomic Database Working Group (TDWG) is currently developing data standards within taxonomic databases, and for data transfer between institutions.
The International Association for Plant Taxonomy (IAPT) is working on plant name standards (the Names in Current Use project).
Kew is working on authority name abbreviations as a bibliographic standard.
It is essential that RBGE continues to co-operate with these bodies, and that we are represented at a high level in those international bodies which are active in taxonomic database work
The software in current use for taxonomy is in a constant state of development.
This work requires expertise in programming using the ‘C’ language, Windows application developer, and Advanced Revelation database management system.
Additionally, any in-house development and trouble-shooting of BG-BASE for the Plant Records System will require a great deal of programming time.
(We anticipate being able to influence the development of BG-BASE).
The preparation of documentation — user guides and full manuals for our applications of PANDORA and BG-BASE — must proceed as quickly as possible, particularly if we we wish to exploit their commercial potential.
We must therefore train suitable staff in programming, and it is likely that an additional member of staff will be required for programming and troubleshooting within the next five years.
Having acquired taxonomic information, and organised it within databases, we need to look at output.
Conventional publications will be made more efficient by networking our copy-preparation hardware and software to the databases.
Image-handling software on the DTP system will facilitate full integration of images and text as camera-ready copy.
The setup should be expanded to take in a plotter for graphic and map output.
It should also include a high-quality colour Optical Character Recognition (OCR) scanner for capturing text from non-electronic sources.
Specific Projects
Our major priority should be the creation of a major family database of world-wide importance.
We have the potential to become one of the world's major taxonomic database centres, because of the high quality of our data relative to that in many other centres, and we have the skills necessary for the efficient information management of such a project.
Our commitment to quality and to professionalism will ensure that this prototype database will stand comparison by international standards.
Within five years we should have made substantial progress towards a Herbarium database, integrated with BG-BASE software, and with software for Herbarium loans and labels.
Collaborative Research
The European Community is about to embark on an ambitious programme of research within the field of biotechnology and genetic diversity, within which plant taxonomic information systems are to play a part by linking taxonomic, molecular and genetic databases.
If RBGE participation in proposals within this programme is approved, we are in an excellent position to take our own scientific work forward while making a substantial contribution to the Community's international position in plant sciences.
The programme will oblige us to invest in higher bandwidth communication equipment for data exchange between institutions.
However, this is a direction in which we would already have been moving for other reasons, and the installation of a digital telephone exchange for the provision of extra lines to our new accommodation will greatly facilitate the process.
Managing projects across countries, and linking different databases on different equipment, are challenging and interesting prospects for information managers, and will oblige us to acquire scarce and commercially valuable expertise, available later for consultancy.
Computers in Experimental Work
We have considered the potential impact of information technology on our laboratory work — primarily on the microscopical and chemical techniques in current use.
Image analysis equipment and software is probably the area of highest potential scientific benefit in the short to medium term, for light and electron microscopy in programmes on rusts and diatoms.
Provided that post-storage image processing is not a major priority, analogue technology is effective.
Frame-grabbing cards can be used, with some small loss of definition, to capture individual video images for later digital processing.
Digital systems are capable of almost infinite manipulation — cleaning, artefact removal by editing, edge enhancement, zoom, cut and paste, colour transformation and so on, but make heavy demands on storage, even with sophisticated data compression techniques.
Optical disks would be essential, and if large numbers of images are to be searched simultaneously, disk changers (juke-box systems) will be necessary.
The use of IT in chemical laboratories is now extensive, but it is both expensive and specialised.
If the Garden is to move towards the integration of molecular information into its taxonomic work, this will require substantial investment in IT, in terms of staff training and equipment.
Current EC research workplans in biotechnology (See below) offer the possibility of collaborative training and research programmes between institutions, and this would offer our own staff the opportunity of acquiring the necessary information and expertise to plan our own future requirements in this field.
Laboratory staff currently make very limited use of computing facilities, other than for word processing.
The potential use of databases for data analysis, and spreadsheets for the production of graphic output of numerical data, has recently been introduced to Laboratory staff, and should be built on.
Hardware Developments
The use of a colour scanner and OCR equipment has already been mentioned above.
We will also require a slide scanning attachment to the camera capturing images for our image databases.
The development of image databases with marketable potential suggests that we should look into the acquisition of CD-ROM mastering hardware.
We note that a CD-ROM version of the Index Kewensis will be available soon, and the Library has acquired a CD-ROM player in anticipation.
(An additional PC will be needed to run it, however).
We are currently evaluating the choice between Re-writeable and WORM (Write Once Read Many) optical disk writing systems.
We advise that the Garden should purchase additional portable PCs for general use as pool stock.
In general, PCs should not be regarded as belonging exclusively to one user, as this has resulted in extreme peaks and troughs in individual machine usage.
We would like to be able to even out the load, by sharing usage where possible.
We recommend that most desk-top PCs should be networked within the next five years, in order to increase efficiency by sharing printers, improving internal communications, and saving on software costs.
This will also require upgrading the network software in advance.
We recommend the introduction of a rolling programme of machine upgrading (VGA colour monitors, faster processors) and replacement.
(See 2.3)
Data loggers should be acquired for the collection of field data within Gardens and on trips.
In the longer term, voice input devices have potential for field data collection.
Satellite location devices, such as Magellan, can be used in association with these systems.
2.3.2 Horticultural Computing
Commercial computer-aided design (CAD) programs have been developed specifically for garden design and work scheduling.
Because the design programs are linked to materials estimating and work scheduling, they are often used by local authorities for competitive tendering.
We should be using such systems within the Horticultural Education course, since future employers of Garden students will increasingly demand familiarity with such systems in future.
These systems will also make considerable savings in staff time if used by appropriate Garden staff as project design and scheduling aids.
Computing needs to be built in as an integral part of the Horticultural Training programme, so that future students will leave having acquired skills in handling word-processing, database, spreadsheet and design programs for correspondence, reports, record management, financial planning, and graphic techniques.
The current situation in Horticultural Education, where over forty students are sharing two PCs, is unsatisfactory, but the demand for computer time is very uneven, peaking during the preparation of 3rd year dissertations, and being very low at other times.
The siting of the student machines in a room used extensively for lectures is also inefficient.
A separate room for student computing, which would also be suitable for lectures and seminars on computing, is needed, together with additional hardware and new software.
Costs: £30,000
2.4 Publications
A variety of different types of publication are prepared in-house, and some external commissions are made.
Scientific publications, aimed at the scientific community, are prepared to camera-ready copy stage, as are newsletters, leaflets, prospectuses, and official reports.
Other material, mostly involving colour-printing, are more cost-effectively dealt with by external services on contract.
The Publications Officer is handling an increasing amount of such material, and preparing it to increasingly high technical specifications.
Additional hardware and software has been obtained recently so that additional staff can use DTP facilities, and to provide backup services.
Typing Services, particularly those involved with papers intended for publication, require to be more closely connected to copy preparation activities, as will those staff who do most of their own typing.
This will require networking to make the physical connections, plus additional training in advanced word processing techniques.
At the same time, some of Public Services Department's work involves the preparation of copy for printing leaflets, handouts, information sheets and other ephemeral material.
Cost savings can be achieved by rationalising DTP work between departments, so that manpower, hardware and specialist software expertise, can be shared wherever practicable.
There is a strong case for integrating mail order publication sales with the activities of the bookshop, and for having a single publications store under a single administrator, using a single stock-control system.
The present situation, where publications are currently stored in several different locations according to their type, and are handled separately by Publications Officer (British Fungus Flora ), Bookshop (most publications), Finance (back numbers of the Notes ), Library (exchange copies), and Garden staff (Catalogue of Plants ), is illogical and wasteful of staff effort.
We recommend that a reference set of all research reports commissioned from or undertaken by RBGE staff should be held in the Library, which should maintain this collection and make an indexed listing available to outside bodies.
This will serve to make our research experience and expertise more widely known to potential users of our consultancy services.
The quality of the finished products should at least match the standards of comparable outside bodies.
The Library should also maintain an index of all RBGE staff publications, no matter where these are published.
A new report binding machine, together with covers and other consumables, should be obtained as a general office facility.
2.5 Staff knowledge
The expertise of the staff encompasses most major plant groups, and field experience exists for most major geographical areas.
As well as personal knowledge, files and other personally-held documentation hold much other information, including field notebooks, correspondence, and photographic slides.
Horticultural staff also have wide knowledge and expertise, which is generally available on a person-to-person basis.
2.5.1 Enquiry services
Botanic Garden Query (BGQ) enquiries, totalling nearly 400 each year, mainly involve plant identifications, plant health and cultivation problems.
Direct enquiries to staff, and to the Library, are not monitored.
Commercial enquiries are few in number, and are either charged for or dealt with in a quid pro quo manner.
The Library currently often acts as a switching centre for enquiries, when Reception staff cannot identify the most appropriate staff member.
Staff-controlled reception areas, telephonists, information points and visitor centres, should have adequate provision of information technology to handle casual visitor enquiries, and to forward detailed enquiries to the most appropriate member of staff.
To this end, we recently circulated a questionnaire to all appropriate staff to identify specialisms and areas in which they may be asked to answer enquiries.
Some attention needs to be given to the appropriate manning of the Reception area out of office hours, in view of the numbers of visiting groups using the lecture theatre and other facilities, and the problems with security which this imposes.
We recommend that a survey of visitors to RBGE offices should be undertaken, in order to determine the reasons for visits, and the volume of such use — we have no current figures for this, no means of ensuring accuracy, and no methodology for making even crude estimates.
2.6 Scientific data
Herbarium materials form the major information resource of scientific data within RBGE.
It is estimated that more than two million specimens are stored, together with the information contained on labels and in associated manuscript material, such as field notebooks, determination lists, card indexes (taxonomic and biographical).
Computerisation of some or all of these resources is seen as desirable, in order to provide:
a)
Material for taxonomic research
b)
Support for plant identification services
c)
A repository of voucher specimens for identifications used in such areas as biogeographical, ecological, biomonitoring and experimental studies.
d)
A source of research material other than for mainstream taxonomy, e.g. molecular studies and environmental monitoring.
The Plant Records Database is a large, developing, computer database of information relating to plants in RBGE.
It will increasingly be used in support of taxonomic and other research in RBGE, and for national and international data exchange, together with new taxonomic databases.
In the long term, electronic scanning and linking to an image database could provide a secure back-up to the herbarium collection, a means of transmitting images to other institutions, and a method for collaborative working between institutions using real-time computer conferencing.
In the shorter term, the equipment required by the Library for Archive microfilming could be used by the Herbarium for the production of type catalogues on fiche, monographic fiche sets and other purposes.
2.7 Horticultural information
At present almost no horticultural information is stored within RBG.
Some paper records exist, but the introduction of the BG-BASE system for plant records should help.
The potential is very high, since horticultural information could be used for many purposes, such as ecological and climatological monitoring, as well as mainstream horticulture.
Current activities have concentrated on data collection, with very little attention being paid to data analysis.
Software for garden design, estimating and scheduling, as used in many local authority parks and recreation departments, and which it is hoped to obtain for Horticultural Education, has the potential for use in the horticultural Departments of the Gardens.
There is a need for us to develop the communication skills of our horticultural staff to a broader degree than at present.
Some horticultural staff write excellent articles in journals, and some are in constant demand for public lectures.
We suggest that other staff should be encouraged to write, but we are aware that this activity lacks an RBGE platform.
The production of a new horticultural journal is not a practical proposition but we feel that we could and should develop links with commercial journals, and that assistance with the preparation of copy for publication should be available.
2.8 Estates, administrative and financial data
Estates data includes maps and documentation relating to maintenance and minor works.
No Dawyck plan exists.
Finance holds income and expenditure records, together with annual accounts, departmental expenditure records, and an Asset Register.
Personnel files are kept in secure storage, with strict conditions attached to access.
The SunAccount package has been installed for Accounts, and will be upgraded as new releases become available.
Expertise in its use needs to be acquired by key staff in other areas, such as retail, library, and garden stores.
The aim will be to run most order/purchasing and payment systems without paper except for unusual times.
We need to acquire a specialist personnel package, and to train staff in its use.
By cutting down on routine paperwork we would hope to be able to increase the level of ‘customer contact’, which would improve the service and provide staff with more job satisfaction.
The issues of line management, annual reporting, and training, are all linked, and have a bearing on the flow of information in staff management.
Reporting officers require induction training, and should be issued with policy guidelines on the way in which reports are to be undertaken.
Countersigning officers should have received some training in JAR interviewing and counselling skills.
We need to tighten the time schedules for the writing of reports, and ensure that the workloads are more evenly spread than they are in some cases at the moment.
These processes are crucial to the promotion process, and failures in communication have led to interpersonal and interdepartmental disputes in the past.
The use of ‘management information systems’, which take low-level data from databases and are used for decision support by modelling future scenarios using different management predictions or alternatives, has led to substantial savings in those commercial organisations where they have been introduced.
They have also led to improvements in the managerial skills of staff in these organisations.
They should be considered now, for possible future implementation.
2.9 Internal communication
We communicate with each other through a variety of methods — by the staff newsletter; by Office Notices (which may be of three types — mandatory, advisory, and informative); by internal memos and notes; committee minutes, and by word of mouth.
a)
Committee Minutes.
We note with approval the Management Group decision to speedily make copies of the non-confidential parts of their Minutes accessible to staff through deposit in the Library and the specialist gardens.
This would have been one of our recommendations.
Where there are inter-departmental committees discussing particular issues, such as the Computer Consultative Group, the Herbarium-Library Extension Committee and others, copies of edited minutes should be deposited in the Library.
b)
Garden Notices We recommend introducing new guide-lines for the issuing of Garden Notices.
It could be that with the wider use of electronic mail which we anticipate in future, the need for multiple copies of Notices will be reduced.
c)
Electronic Communications Some significant efficiency improvements will be made by establishing electronic links between the Library's ordering system and Finance's accounting package.
Similar links should be established between databases in the Herbarium and Plant Records systems, and between scientific writers and the Publications Department, so that information does not have to be re-typed or re-keyboarded.
Within the next five years, most PCs should be networked, and should be running network software.
d)
News Sheets The staff News Sheet has recently been re-launched, with a new name (‘Vitis’), improved design, layout, editorial and distribution arrangements, and a monthly frequency.
It was intended as a staff information bulletin, and it may be that electronic mail will reduce the requirement for it.
Since the launch of our newsletter, ‘The Botanics’, and the proposed issuing of a newsletter by the Friends of the RBGE, it is probably time to take stock of the total amount of news material which we are now producing, the staff effort involved, the uses to which the information is being put, and the efficiency with which each vehicle reaches its target readership.
We recommend that a small group, which would include a Friends representative, be formed to consider this and make recommendations to Management.
e)
Internal Delivery Service The internal delivery system by messenger is a consequence of the wide scattering of staff over large areas and different buildings.
The use of e-mail, rationalisation of collection points, concentration of staff in the Inverleith Row premises, and reduction in the frequency of collections are likely to lead to a requirement for fewer staff to be deployed on Messenger duties.
f)
Lectures and Seminars Internal lectures and seminars are an important way of keeping all RBGE staff in touch with current work.
Formal lectures have usually been given in the afternoons within scheduled programmes, either internally or in association with other societies and groups.
It should be recognised that open invitations to all staff to attend can be disruptive to normal line management, and can conflict with the efficient running of service departments where continuous manning is essential.
Informal briefings and seminars are generally held over the lunch-time period, which is only flexible for scientific and administrative staff.
Horticultural staff are disadvantaged in this regard.
2.10 Other Information Technology (IT) Issues
This includes presentational hardware (projectors, screens, sound equipment and so on), communications hardware (fax machines, online links between gardens and between RBGE and external organisations), document scanners, graphics plotters and video equipment.
Much of this equipment is complex, some is in need of upgrading, and some gaps exist.
A new telephone system will be required within the next five years, to cope with additional lines to our new accommodation and the Herbarium/Library extension building.
Costs in this area are not clear at the moment, except for the telephone system, which is likely to cost some £25,000.
Fax machines have now been installed in the specialist gardens, as they represent a very cost-effective and efficient means of communicating.
This would have been one of our immediate recommendations.
Personal pagers (‘bleepers’) are used by a small number of staff, mainly key technical personnel in Estates.
This system, if extended to those staff who regularly spend periods away from their normal workplace, would reduce the workload on the telephonist, Library staff and others, and improve response time in answering enquiries.
Staff underuse the present ‘transfer call’ facilities on the telephone system, and might benefit from training, which need not take long.
Meeting Room facilities should be considered when allocating rooms within the former SOTU accommodation.
Conference Room 1 is very useful for larger meetings, but there is scope for the use of a smaller room for groups of up to a dozen staff and/or external users.
3 Visitor Information Services
3.1 Visitors
Whilst the 1985 Act obliges us to ‘afford access to our lands for the purposes of knowledge and enjoyment’, it is perhaps true to say that most visitors, possibly as many as 95%, make use of the Gardens as an amenity, and that we may have failed to emphasise the ‘knowledge’ goal.
We need to inform them wherever possible of the scientific purposes which underpin our horticultural activities and our research work.
There is uncertainty concerning the accuracy of our present method of counting visitor numbers to Edinburgh, but there are statistical procedures available for estimating numbers to a high degree of accuracy.
We should carry out the sampling procedures and proceed with an analysis as soon as possible, so that we have an accurate baseline for future measurements.
The aim, in advertising, promotion and in providing visitor attractions at Edinburgh, should not merely be to increase visitor numbers (a visit on a hot weekend in June will demonstrate the negative aspects of having too many people in our 60 acres of public space).
Our purpose should be to provide visitors with experiences which will enhance their knowledge, enjoyment and appreciation of the work carried out here in ways that will make them wish to support us, but not overwhelm us.
We also need to foster links with the many special interest groups within the horticultural and botanical communities who could benefit from our specialist knowledge and experience, and from the facilities we are able to offer them.
The visitor pressures at Younger, Dawyck and Logan Gardens are much less severe, since these Gardens are all some way from major population centres, and Younger and Dawyck in particular have the acreage to provide for visitor dispersion.
The entrance charges also ensure that we know exactly how many people visit these Gardens.
Visitors making use of our other information services, such as exhibitions, lectures, library, educational facilities, and enquiry services, are likely to increase.
We need to ensure that such increases can be accommodated without conflicting with the core work carried out in support of our primary objectives.
Garden visitors come in greatest numbers at weekends, and in the summer.
These are periods when staff able to provide information to visitors are either reduced in numbers or absent.
Visitor attractions at off-peak times or in off-season periods are unlikely to have any significant effect in reducing peaks, but they may help to spread the loading on staff time.
We therefore need to seek alternative methods of information provision at these times, through better orientation, interpretation, labelling, information leaflets, novel technological methods, and through the use of those staff who are on duty as information providers.
At present, the first RBG Edinburgh staff contact which the general public has on entering the Garden is with the Constabulary — to all intents and purposes identical in appearance with the Police Force.
The image which our visitors perceive is not consonant with the one which we need to project in order to enhance our public profile and to promote public awareness and understanding of our inter-linked scientific and horticultural objectives.
To a large extent, garden visitors are self-policing, with very limited vandalism or public order problems.
A smaller number of security staff having the functions of the present Constabulary will be required in future, augmented by a new category of RBGE staff — Garden Guides or Garden Assistants, clearly identifiable as Garden staff by livery — who would have a role in providing information and assistance to visitors.
Some of these staff would man information and service points, or conduct guided tours, whilst others would patrol the garden.
By their presence, they would fulfil a security function, but their most significant contribution will be to satisfy visitors’ information requirements at the point of need.
It is recognised that signs, leaflets and labels have their place, but that the most effective communication takes place at the personal level.
The creation of this new category could be undertaken by the level transfer and retraining of suitable Constabulary staff, with new staff being taken on as these transferred staff retire.
Garden staff are often approached by visitors with requests for information, and we would wish to encourage them to continue to provide such a service, provided that this assistance does not interfere with their normal work.
The introduction of protective clothing with the Garden logo will help visitors to identify such staff.
3.2 Orientation.
Large maps on boards are currently being designed by Public Services staff in co-operation with the Business Development Director.
These plans will be supplemented by leaflets and guidebooks for all four Gardens.
An information board for each entrance should also be provided, so that visitors can be given topical information — what is going on, what is worth seeing at any given time — as well as permanent information on the Garden itself.
The horticultural staff could provide input to this board.
Embryonic visitor centres at Younger and Logan will be in place by 1992, and the provision of information will form a large part of their work.
The horticultural quality of the specialist gardens should form the major emphasis in trying to attract visitors, and we need information on the effectiveness of current advertising, signposting, route-finding, and tourist information centre leafletting.
To this end we should undertake visitor surveys at all of the specialist gardens, which will help us to plan such promotional activities logically and cost-effectively.
Commercial coach trips to the specialist gardens should be encouraged, and we or our Friends could also organize tours.
3.3 Exhibitions
Exhibitions should be treated as interpretive media in their own right.
Every exhibition should be treated as an opportunity to inform visitors about our scientific activities and priorities.
Each exhibition proposal should be examined by Management to determine its value to the organization in terms of interpreting our activities.
Planning exhibitions should be carried out within a rolling three-year cycle, so that strategic, management, budgetary, horticultural, and logistic aspects can be incorporated in a professional manner well ahead of time.
Longer planning leads will enable Horticultural and scientific staff to bring on appropriate living material for incorporation into the displays.
Management should agree on an annual major unifying exhibition theme which should relate to our main activities.
There should be enough spaces in the exhibition schedules and venues to allow for the mounting of lower priority short-term exhibitions outwith the major thematic exhibitions.
It is suggested that the first unifying theme for 1992 should be ‘The work of the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh’, and that work should start on preparing a modular exhibit, parts of which can be convertible to form smaller mobile exhibition stands for erection at other venues.
3.3.1 Exhibition areas
1.
Caledonian Hall.
This should be a multi-function space, utilising wall areas for large informative photographs of RBGE activities.
Temporary exhibitions can be accommodated in the floor area, and after some building modifications the space can also be used for enterprise activities.
The Garden Label Engraver should be moved to the Inverleith Row offices in the interests of improving efficiency by using online computer links to the Plant Records database.
The present site is too remote to allow for networking, and plant record information has to be sent to the engraver as print-outs using Messenger Services.
The use of this Hall by staff for extra-curricular activities is incongruous, and should only be permitted to continue if there is no conflict with an exhibition programme.
2.
Inverleith House.
The Ground Floor should be reserved for a permanent exhibition on the work of the Garden.
The modular exhibition described above can be utilised subsequently for this purpose.
On the First Floor, we should display material from a Permanent Collection of RBGE-owned botanical artworks.
The Regius Keeper should appoint a Committee which would review the collection, recommend new purchases, and supervise hanging.
The Basement area has been equipped for audio-visual presentations.
All Public Services staff should be in accommodation within the Inverleith Row buildings, to improve inter-staff communication and to increase efficiency by sharing expensive equipment.
3.
Exhibition Hall.
This space was purpose-built for exhibitions, and this should remain its primary function.
It can also be used to provide class-room space for Educational purposes.
Teachers making use of our facilities should incorporate information on the Garden into their teaching, which will promote respect for the Garden and its work as a long-term objective.
Garden leaflets should always be distributed to teachers.
We require much better storage facilities for exhibition material.
The store should be sited with an eye to deliveries, access to exhibition areas and other Departments, and security.
The present store area within the Exhibition Hall should be freed to allow for conversion to classroom use.
We identify a need for the preparation of new visitor experiences by creating imaginative, innovative science-based exhibition material, such as tactile displays emulating plant tissues, electro-mechanical devices demonstrating for example carnivorous plants, and audio-visual presentations using inter-active video (See Section 4.1.3) to demonstrate plant diversity, taxonomy and distribution.
New environmental enclosures could be created to demonstrate the conditions (soil, temperature, humidity, light, diurnal and seasonal fluctuations etc.) experienced by the plants of Dhofar, for example.
Experimental horticulture at this level would provide much-needed scientific background data for improved cultivation methods for plants from extreme environments, whilst providing visitors with an appreciation of the principles involved in habitat modeling, plant diversity, and plant collecting in the regions we specialise in.
Such complex technical tasks would need the skills of a suitably experienced engineer, possibly on a contract basis for each project, as well as project design, project management, and data input and analysis by horticultural and scientific staff.
3.4 Publications for Visitors.
The highest priority is the publication of a suite of up-to-date comprehensive guidebooks and map leaflets for the four gardens.
We do not have a complete, up-dated list of all of the publications produced or handled by RBGE staff.
We should produce such a list, which would include ephemeral material like leaflets, posters, postcards etc, as well as conventional publications.
A Reference set of all of this material should be kept permanently in the Library.
In support of publications, the Photographic Department should work to seasonal schedules drawn up by the Curator, the specialist Garden Curators, the Chief Photographer, and the Head of Public Services.
This work should start immediately so that a schedule for 1992 can be drawn up.
The priority Garden for 1992 will be Edinburgh, with Dawyck being the 1993 priority.
Gaps in photographic coverage at Logan and Younger should be identified for future schedules.
Due to the high costs of equipment for high-quality colour printing, the actual printing work should be contracted out, but the design work can be carried out in-house.
Packages of informative leaflets/booklets for different Garden areas need to be written.
Glasshouses, Cryptogamic Garden, Fossil Garden, Alpine House, Herbaceous Border, Rhododendron collection, plus one specialist garden per year, are some of the suggested topics.
Priorities should be agreed between the Curator and the Head of Public Services.
These leaflets should include horticultural advice, so that they can be used to answer enquiries.
Seasonal leaflets, along the lines of those produced some years ago, are likely to be popular with visitors.
Some of these leaflets will have saleable potential, and the Business Development Director should advise on appropriate charges.
The finished suite of leaflets could be made available for sale as a publication in its own right.
We should produce postcards and publicity flyers using our own photographic resources.
Posters for sale could be produced from the Library's resource of illustrations, and from other sources.
3.5 Design
This subject is intimately bound up with our corporate image.
We cannot fully implement a new corporate image until funds are available, and we suggest that there are other projects for the development of our information services which are more pressing, and which have more income-generating or cost-reducing potential in the short term.
We should work towards the production of a style manual for general use in stationery, signs, displays and ephemeral publications, and use a modified form of the ‘Sibbaldia’ logo on official stationery, livery on protective clothing, official vehicles and in other appropriate places.
The way in which we present ourselves to outsiders conveys information about the organisation, its aims, the professionalism of our staff, and the methods by which we operate.
We are very poorly represented in this area at present.
Whilst some of our design work can be contracted out, the recent installation of computer hardware and software dedicated to graphic design will reduce costs after staff have been suitably trained.
Whilst much of our design work should be carried out within Public Services, there are other staff who carry out design work in Garden Departments, Business, Publications, and other areas.
3.6 Advertising, Promotion, Tourism
The current budget for these activities is very low, and we therefore need to ensure that it is spent in the most cost-effective way possible.
Increasing visitor numbers will not of itself increase our income, and it does lead to pressures on the Gardens themselves, particularly Edinburgh (See 3.1).
We must therefore identify target audiences related to our core work for our advertising, and aim our material at these specific targets.
The Press and Media Relations Officer has costed a number of possible alternatives (Appendix C), and there needs to be close collaboration between Public Services Department, the Curator, and the Business Development Director over all of our promotional activities.
It may be possible to devolve advertising budgets for the specialist gardens to their managers, and to use local input, supported from the centre, to hit local targets.
We particularly need to improve the placement of our publicity material in tourist centres, including the development of hotel packs.
When special events take place at any of the gardens, adequate stocks of publicity material need to be placed on-site.
It is therefore critical that Public Services staff be aware of these events in advance.
Most of the 1992 slots for our advertising have already been booked, although in some cases the content has not yet been written.
For 1993, we should begin planning a professional programme, including pilot advertising with monitoring of the results.
We need research into the effectiveness of our advertising, to be completed by August 1992, so that the 1993 programme can be properly planned.
We should immediately stop ad hoc advertising, since our resources are so limited.
We should concentrate on fewer things, but do them professionally.
3.7 Media
We should aim to produce continuously updated media packs, for sending to target organisations and individuals.
It is recognised that our scientific and horticultural activities are of interest to two separate potential audiences, and the packs need to be tailored accordingly.
For the horticultural work, links need to be established and maintained between ourselves and the major gardening programme makers, specialist gardening magazines, and the gardening correspondents of the major newspapers.
In the case of science, the target areas will be the makers of such popular programmes as Horizon, Equinox, and the BBC Natural History Unit at Bristol, plus the newspaper science correspondents, and the broadly based science journals such as New Scientist, Nature, and Endeavour.
Management needs to establish policy guidelines for the Press and Media Relations Officer to work to; some of the present activities are carried out reactively, in response to immediate situations and pressures, and pre-planning would assist in the integration of this work with our scientific, horticultural and business objectives.
This would be greatly facilitated by moving the work of this office into the Inverleith Row premises.
This will strengthen and widen staff contacts, and improve access to facilities, such as computer address lists, DTP, and communication equipment.
Discussions between P & M RO and individual managers will establish specialist departmental needs and specialist markets for advertising, promotion, and media contacts, as well as briefing managers on the services which can be provided.
3.8 Open Days
In principle, the idea of holding Open Days is a good one, but these events need to be planned at least two years in advance, so that funding, manpower, and equipment resources can be built in to the estimates for all those Garden Departments which will be involved.
Amateur Open Days do no good to anyone.
The next possible commemorative year on which we might hang an Open Day and other celebrations would appear to be 1999, marking 300 years since the Royal Charter was granted to James Sutherland (12 January, 1699).
It is not too early to begin thinking about it now, particularly if this is to be a Royal occasion.
3.9 Volunteers and Friends
Several Departments could make use of assistance from volunteer workers, without in any way compromising existing staffing levels.
It is envisaged that, if the Friends are willing to help in this way, properly trained volunteers, who would have to be members of the Friends organisation and who would have their approval, could help with special events and special projects, where existing staff do not have sufficient time to carry out the work.
Within Photographic Department, for example, volunteers could assist with the filing of slides and prints, and with data entry for a photographic database.
In the Library, assistance with the indexing of the archive collection, and in the separation of original artworks from the illustrations collection for conservation and indexing, are two activities which would be outside the scope and resources of existing staff.
The Friends might also be willing to run our Garden Seat Donation Scheme.
We need to ask the Friends themselves what sort of help they want to contribute.
4 Management and Finance
4.1 Structure
Our information services are currently run by different Departments, and are not co-ordinated.
Broadly speaking, the ‘internal’ resources (Library, Science, Photography, Publications) are managed by the Deputy Keeper, or Garden Secretary (Administration, Estates).
‘External’ services (Exhibitions, Education, Press and Media Relations) are the responsibility of the Head of Public Services.
We do not see any need to restructure these services at the moment, but we do see a need for closer collaboration between the external and internal services.
In the case of Computing, recent structural changes resulted in the formation of an executive Computing Management Panel comprising G Lomas, R Pankhurst and C Will.
This sort of inter-Departmental structure may be the model for other Garden services which span several Departments.
The efficient co-ordination of our information policies can best be achieved by maintaining a small strategic planning group to make recommendations to Management.
The Computer Consultative Group could serve as the model for this committee, which would oversee current activities in this field, suggest new developments and initiatives to Management, and monitor their introduction.
We ourselves are all fully committed to the idea that the effective communication of information from our resources to each other and to our user community is a fundamental objective directly flowing from the obligations laid on us by statute.
The same degree of commitment exists in many other staff within RBGE, and should be encouraged at all levels.
Information is our stock-in-trade, and we should see ourselves as custodians, users, and disseminators of information.
We recognize that changes in attitude can be encouraged by good staff training, particularly in management and communication skills, and we would wish to encourage management to offer such training on as wide a basis as possible.
4.2 Funding
We have not identified funding sources for these suggested improvements.
We feel that some should come from core funding, as support for existing programmes.
We strongly feel that the implementation of sound information policies will lead to improvements in efficiency, and hence to cost savings, whilst supporting a much higher level of research within the organization.
Other sources of income should be approached for funding individual projects.
A photographic company might wish to support our conservation programme for glass negatives; a charitable trust may be willing to support the microfilming of the archive collection, or the establishment of an image database; European Community funding may be available for information technology and database work; potential employers may be able to help with computer training for DHE students; specialist societies and scientific groups may help to fund image databases or conservation-related biogeographical studies, and educational publishers are likely to be interested in interactive video for schools and colleges.
Joint research projects with the universities offer the potential for cost-savings, provided that we can offer good facilities here, and that the scientific content of the research is of a very high standard.
It should be recognized by those putting forward proposals for joint research projects that these will make demands on our information resources, and that the costs of such usage should form an element in each proposal.
The proposed M.Sc.
course in taxonomic botany will make considerable use of our information resources, and staff expertise, but hopefully the research undertaken will also be of benefit to ourselves.
Lead times for some of these proposals may be quite long, and some staff may need help with the drafting of proposals.
4.3 Links to other strategic plans
We have shown that information does not sit in discrete reservoirs waiting to be tapped.
It is of most use when it can flow freely and efficiently between staff, and between staff and the outside world.
The implementation of sound information policies depends on the exchange of information between different elements of our overall strategic plan.
Science:
Not only do we need to build up a collection of RBGE staff publications, but we should also ensure that external researchers given significant access to RBGE facilities agree to deposit copies of their publications, reports and theses within the Library as a condition of use.
Data exchange between institutions, as part of collaborative scientific projects and in twinning arrangements, has implications for IT equipment and software.
The computing part of information policy is inextricably linked to our scientific work.
Floristic research requires access to databases, geographic information systems, and text retrieval & processing packages.
Taxonomic research requires textual numerical and image databases, and statistical software.
Molecular research needs graphics terminals and analytical software, and makes substantial use of online searching of remote bibliographic databases.
Conservation:
Databases for the Conifer Conservation Programme are under investigation.
Using image scanners, it should be possible to capture Alan Mitchell's tree measurement data, and link this to bibliographic and taxonomic databases compiled by Dr Page and Dr Farjon (Utrecht).
Pilot systems for capturing and recording specimen and location data in the field have potential in many other areas where taxonomic input into conservation research is required.
Education:
The preparation of educational material, such as educational information packs and interactive video projects, can be carried out efficiently using networked computers for data exchange, and for cutting costs by sharing printers and other output devices.
The Botanic Gardens Education Network will require high-speed, low-cost access to gateways for computer communications.
Horticulture:
Electronic data communication between Gardens, and within Gardens, can increase efficiency by reducing delays.
Data loggers within the Garden can be used to record information for incorporation into central databases.
Improved communication links between Inverleith Row and the Nursery will be needed, using digital data network equipment linked to a new digital telephone exchange.
The same system, with upgraded modem equipment and better software, will enable faster data transmission between the specialist gardens and the plant records system.
Horticultural research will require better computer equipment, software, and staff training.
Project management, incorporating information management, within these programmes will ensure that they are carried out to the same high standard as our taxonomic and floristic research.
Business:
We have identified a number of products which have tradeable potential, such as publications, image databases, herbarium microfilm, and CD-ROMs.
Many of our other suggestions are aimed at improving visitor experiences, by providing knowledge and enjoyment.
Some of these services, such as enquiry and advice, interactive video learning, environmental enclosures, have commercial potential.
5 Ten years ahead
The Garden has the information resources and much of the staff expertise and enthusiasm to be at the leading edge of IT within ten years.
Probably the area of maximum potential impact is in taxonomic computing.
The appointment of a specialist of considerable experience and an international reputation in the fields of statistics and taxonomic databases will lead us into a very different situation in the whole area of scientific computing within RBGE.
Statistical analysis techniques in taxonomy demand the use of powerful workstations, as would chemotaxonomic methods.
Specialist image analysis equipment for light and electron microscope images also require interfacing with powerful computers.
There should be a continuous review procedure for the development of computer hardware and software facilities.
From a 1991 stand-point, in five years time we should possibly be looking towards SPARC-based workstations running from a large multi-user Unix file-server, but this is an area where rapid technological change requires planning to be a continuously updated process.
It is probable that current developments in IT will solve many of our present and future problems in ways which we cannot foresee.
What is clear is that the costs of memory and storage devices are decreasing, whilst storage capacity is increasing enormously.
Gigabyte storage using optical disks is available now at a price, and may become a realistic option for computerising Herbarium image data well within the next ten years.
We can also foresee the use of vocal interaction with databases which combine text and illustrations.
There is also the possibility of using neural computing techniques as an aid to plant recognition and classification.
We see the provision of information from Visitor Centres at all of our sites as being one of the most significant ways in which we can make the information resources of the Garden available to the maximum number of people at reasonable cost.
This is likely to result in increased demand for access to our other information services.
This demand must not be built up at the expense of the core scientific activity of the Garden, however.
Glossary
BG-BASE .
The software used for the Plant Records database.
BIOSIS .
An online database, the electronic equivalent of Biological Abstracts .
See also CABI .
C .
A programming language used to develop application software.
CABI .
This is a bibliographic database produced by the C ommonwealth A gricultural B ureau International.
It is the electronic version of all of the CAB's published abstracting journals, including Horticultural Abstracts, Forestry Abstracts, and several others.
The paper versions (hard copy) are extremely difficult to search through systematically, particularly if the search is to extend over several years.
The database is available in two forms —online and as regularly updated CD-ROM s.
CAD.
Computer Aided Design.
This type of software is widely used in industry, architecture, etc to produce design drawings.
It allows for scaling, rotation and many other ways of manipulating images.
CD-ROM (Compact Disk — Read Only Memory).
These are Optical Disks which contain digital data.
They are ‘read-only’ because they are commonly produced commercially for database users, many of which are libraries.
Database .
Software for organising, sorting, indexing, storing and presenting information.
Most modern systems are of the very powerful relational type, which means that different databases can be linked together through the use of common fields.
DIP (Document Image Processing).
This is a technique in which a single page is scanned, and the image is captured and stored as a single digitised file.
The page may consist of text, images, or a mixture of both.
The file is stored in a highly compressed form.
DOS .
Disk Operating System .
The most common operating system for IBM & IBM-compatible computers.

Frame-grabber .
Hardware used to capture video images, process them, and send the digitised images to storage devices.
Hypercard .
A type of non-relational database, peculiar to Apple Macintosh computers, sometimes used for the development of interactive video systems, since different types of file (text, image, sound) can be searched at the same time.
The DOS environment can now handle mixed data at least as well, but has not yet achieved comparable market penetration, due in part to brand loyalty.
Image database .
A database which handles graphic information.
The images are reproducible electronic versions of scanned illustrations, slides, microscopic and other visual material.

A piece of communication equipment used to enable computers to send data to and from each other.
Within RBGE, modems are used to transmit data from other computers using telephone lines.
NICU .
Names in current use.
A project being run by IAPT aimed at producing a standard list of plant names.
OCR .
Optical Character Recognition.
A type of scanner which can encode characters on a page and store them electronically.
Online searching .
The Library carries out literature searches on behalf of staff, by interrogating large bibliographic databases which are mounted on very large computers.
The systems commonly searched in RBGE are BIOSIS and SCISEARCH , which are on the large DIALOG computer in Palo Alto, California, and BLAISE, the system produced by the British Library.
The computers are accessed by means of a modem linked to a PC and a telephone line.
Search costs are reasonable, provided the search is carried out by a trained librarian using appropriate professional skills in search strategy formulation.
Operating System .
The software which determines how particular computers handle data — input, storage, processing and output.
Two common ones are DOS for PCs, and Unix for minis and other medium-size systems.
Optical storage .
The data is stored as a series of bumps created by a laser tracking above the surface of the disk.
Another laser beam is used to ‘read’ the bumps.
The disks are similar to audio CD, but slightly different tracking methods are used.
Very high storage rates are possible using this type of technology.
Search times are usually slower than magnetic disks, because the reading head has to follow a track.
Data can be ‘written’ to two different types of optical media —rewritable and WORM disks.
Plotter.
A device used to produce maps, architectural drawings and other graphic output.
See also CAD .
Rewritable .
A type of Optical disk on which information is eraseable.
The disks can thus be re-used.
Scanner .
A device which ‘reads’ graphic or text information, and stores an electronic version of the data.
(Supermarket scanners are used to convert printed bar-codes into price and stock-control information.
SCISEARCH .
An online database; the electronic version of Science Citation Index (which is extremely expensive).
TDWG .
The Taxonomic Database Working Group.
An international body currently working on standards for international data exchange among other things.
Unix .
An operating system sometimes found in multi-user minicomputers.
In the past, it suffered from not being a single uniform system, and from having severe data security problems.
Very little scientific software was available to run on Unix machines until relatively recently.
VGA .
Computers display information on screens using a specific piece of hardware to process screen data.
Video Graphics Array (VGA) is one very common example.
WORM disks .
WORM (Write-Once-Read-Many) disks eventually fill up, since new data can only be written after what has gone before.

Forward Look
The Library's information policy will concentrate on:
1.
eliminating weaknesses in our current information management, e.g. by increasing access to the information resources, and by improving user interfaces;
2.
improving physical storage conditions for archives, illustrations, reprints, artefacts, and other non-book materials; and
3.
introducing value-added information services with tradeable potential, such as image databases, optical/electronic publishing, interactive video, and collaborative online botanical information services.
User access to our bibliographic data is currently by means of a card catalogue, with some analytical indexes.
Additionally, Library staff can access Altos files of catalogue information for about 6,000 records, and this data will be transferred and merged with the 1,000 records available on the new Soutron Library System.
Costs of full retrospective conversion of catalogue cards would be in the region of £50,000 to £60,000 for 70,000 author entries (books only) at current prices, but considerable editing work on these records would be needed, because cataloguing standards have been applied inconsistently (or not at all) over many years, and many of the older records are inaccurate, insufficient, or unreliable.
The purchase of externally-sourced catalogue records (e.g. from OCLC or VTLS) would not be cost-effective, since so many of our records are unique, or shared only with other specialist botanical libraries not contributing records to these services — we would have to do it all again ourselves, and we lack the manpower resources to do this.
Analytical cards are interfiled with the main cards, and constitute another 80 — 100,000 entries, which are all unique to ourselves and would require manual keyboarding by professional staff.
We must therefore retain the card catalogue for non-current material, and introduce an Online Public Access Catalogue (OPAC) for current publications.
The OPAC is part of the Library LAN, which should be introduced shortly.
Analytical entries, derived from scanning journals, are of several types — current awareness, enquiry answering, taxonomic, biographical, illustrations.
Some of these can be integrated with the Library's cataloguing module, whilst the taxonomic ones can form a database which could interface with BG-BASE as a ‘Data Source’ file.
Since this database has the potential for generating income as a value-added service (online or CD-ROM), it should be maintained and accessed separately from BG-BASE, and interfaced rather than integrated.
This interface will require to be written.
Other methods of content analysis, including subject classification, indexing, and thesaurus construction, will be undertaken, provided that the analysis matches RBGE's strategic scientific and horticultural priorities.
The Library's historical archive is arranged in a reasonable historical order, and is contained in acid-free boxes, but it is at the moment unindexed, and the store room which contains it is totally unsuitable for archive consultation.
In addition, some of the paper is fragile and in need of conservation.
Continued usage damages the paper further, and there is the possibility of mis-filing or loss of records.
At some time within the next five years, the collection should be indexed and stored electronically or on microform.
Storage on optical media is possible, using document image processing (DIP) technology, but standards for optical media are still very fluid, and we must avoid becoming trapped by non-mainstream hardware/software.
The current problem is that we cannot predict which of today's options will become tomorrow's mainstream.
A recent demonstration of the 3M Computer Aided Retrieval system, which uses microfilm cartridges linked to a computer-generated indexing system, has suggested a cost-effective way forward here, which does not cut itself off from future DIP systems.
The costs would be in the region of £15,000, and the archives could be filmed and indexed with one man-year's effort.
This solution would also have the knock-on effect that the Library would no longer require a separate Archive Room in Phase 2 of current Herbarium/Library extension plans.
Microfilm copies of the Archives could be consulted in the main Library, leaving the originals in secure storage.
There may be scope here for involving a ‘Friends’ organization for funding and labour, since our history is such a fascinating topic in its own right.
The microfilm camera, which forms an integral part of the set-up, would be available for use elsewhere, e.g. by Photographic Department.
The Illustrations Collection contains some 250,000 sheets, of varying degrees of quality and utility.
It is arranged systematically, but is unindexed, and is totally unresponsive to name changes and revisions.
Additions are therefore difficult to manage, and there has been no attempt to keep the collection up-to-date.
It is physically housed in vertical files which are of non-standard size, and which are no longer in manufacture.
As a consequence, they are falling apart.
Apart from illustrations clipped from duplicate journals and books, the collection contains large numbers of original artworks, which are unlisted and unidentified.
These original works should be separated, so that individual indexing and conservation can be carried out.
They also, together with other non-copyright or RBG-copyright illustrations, could form the basis for a value-added service.
It is proposed that this collection should be sifted, and the contents scanned and stored electronically on optical media.
We need to be developing such systems within the next five years, and we need to purchase the necessary hardware and software soon, so as to begin the evaluation and development phases.
The Library will therefore wish to install CD-ROM, WORM, hypermedia, and videodisk systems in support of this and other IT projects.
Such large programmes can be carried out most effectively only where standards are agreed, and it is recommended that development work should proceed with some input from similar institutions, so that we are all working along similar lines.
Preliminary contacts with Kew suggest that this might be a profitable service, which could attract EC investment for work involving several institutions in different countries.
The costs will be in the region of £30,000 to £60,000 for full optical systems, but entry level systems for hypermedia, CD-ROM, WORM and videodisk technology can be obtained off-the-shelf at the moment, and built up over the next five to ten years.
The Library could budget for phased installation of entry level systems within the next three years by spending a proportion of its budget in each of these years, and working on these systems would give us the expertise to proceed to development phase.
Other non-book materials have particular storage and retrieval problems, which are probably less urgent than illustrations, but if it is decided to place copies of RBG slides in the Library, they can be handled by the technology envisaged.
The original artworks contained in the Library's main collection also need listing, indexing and conservation.
The Lillian Snelling works, for instance, are of interest to Kew, and it has been suggested that a joint exhibition could be mounted.
Image databases for cryptogamic research are thought to have commercial potential, for relatively small investments in IT.
If compatible lines of IT development are pursued, these investments can be spread over several projects.
The Library has the potential to develop initiatives in interactive video, through research contacts established with the Department of Information Science at the University of Strathclyde.
The technology can be used to produce interactive educational and interpretational programmes, making use of text, graphics, and still and moving video images.
These programmes should be developed in collaboration with Public Services’ educational and exhibition staff.
Cost Summary
1b Mailing Lists
Forward Look
The adoption of a Local Area Network (LAN) strategy has provided us with a very flexible base for future computing.
Major functional differences have decided the nature and shape of individual networks.
Since, for example, administrative and financial activities do not impinge on plant records, these activities have been separated on two LANs — they work faster and more efficiently separately, and faults in one do not disable the other.
Similarly, the Library's problems are unique and specialised, and a third LAN is about to be installed to run specialist software for library information management.
The next LAN to be developed will probably be for Horticultural Education, where external funding is currently being sought for hardware and software to run specialist grounds maintenance, works scheduling, and computerised landscape design and costing.
(This software could be used by Garden departments when sufficient in-house expertise has been built up).
Links between LANs are needed for individual special purposes.
The Library needs links to Finance for the efficient processing of its financial transactions, and for real-time financial management information.
File-based links can also be developed from the Library's taxonomic indexes to the plant records system.
The network topology within each LAN is flexible.
Each node (PC, terminal or workstation) is replaceable, as are the file servers, and peripherals (printers, scanners, plotters) can be upgraded easily.
We have what is in effect a ‘plug-in’ system, with the potential for whatever expansion financial resources and Garden imperatives dictate.
All new replacement PCs should be of higher specification than existing machines, which will then be freed for stand-alone use, and it is recommended that SCSI boards should be installed for the more efficient use of peripherals.
A variety of operating systems (DOS, VMS, Unix V) were considered during the planning stages of the computer upgrade.
At that time, Unix existed in several versions, and there were no universal standards.
Since then, two fairly closely related (but still incompatible in some areas) Unix standards have emerged, and many of the security and transaction processing problems associated with the Xenix dialect of Unix then in use on the Altos have been addressed in the newer Unix systems.
The advantages of Unix for multi-user systems are becoming more widely accepted in computing circles, but it should be noted that Unix versions of our specialist software packages are as yet unavailable.
It could be that at some future date we may wish to consider running DOS-based PCs from a Unix file-server, but it is preferable that we leave this as a possible option at the moment, rather than a definite commitment.
Another potential future LAN would be for Public Services and Publications, in view of the close functional links which have developed between some of their activities, and the need to minimise cost increases by sharing expensive hardware.
In this area, we have the possibility for including non-DOS machines on networks, by using the appropriate cabling and software.
We could install an Apple-MAC for graphic work, together with an Amstrad and other machines for file conversion and transfer to DTP.
This potential LAN could, theoretically, service all text-processing activities (including typing), and share expensive peripherals.
The needs of the specialist gardens for good communications with Edinburgh must be taken into consideration when discussing our future communication policy.
Modem linkage for Dawyck will be needed within the next five years, and it may be that at that point we could decide to install a multiplexor to deal with all of our external computer links — use of local EUCS services, JANET, PSS, Royline and others.
This is a growth area, and it will need specialist advice within the next five years.
2a Horticultural Plant Information
Database
At present almost no horticultural information is stored within the system.
Reasonable access is available to the Edinburgh staff.
Poor access for SG staff should improve when modem systems are fully implemented.
The other ‘Users’ have made little use of this facility in the past.
The BG-BASE system promises great potential, but has been very slow in being set up.
The speed at which staff are being trained to use the system is also very slow.
The BG-BASE system has to prove itself by being actively promoted to its target users.
Paper Records
Paper records exist in the various departments, but they tend to be self-monitored, and are rarely referred to by other departments.
Their use by other ‘users’ is extremely rare.
BG-BASE may be able to absorb much of this information, but only when that information relates to specific plants.
Publications
A few horticultural staff have published articles in the horticultural press, but none have written books on horticultural techniques, plant groups or management practices.
Horticultural publication has always been treated with low priority compared to taxonomic research at RBGE.
Horticultural papers should possibly be included in the Edinburgh Journal of Botany, or one issue annually to be devoted to horticultural papers.
RBG Kew has led the way with horticultural and taxonomic publications.
RBGE must follow suit or possibly look to other styles of publication.
2b Local requirements of specialist gardens
GUIDEBOOKS
Guidebooks are ideal for conveying essential information to the public.
Current status:
YBG Absent for last three years.
Temporary leaflet only means of supplying essential information.
LBG Has guidebook.
DBG Acquired by RBG in 1979 but still without a guidebook.
A black and white leaflet is available for the public.
DISPLAY MAPS
Absent from all gardens.
As garden developments continue, often with good footpath access, encouraging the public into these areas is proving virtually impossible.
Display maps at the key positions should remove this problem.
INFORMATION PANELS
Absent from all gardens.
Essential for explaining plant groups, planting schemes, etc.
GUIDED TOURS
Guided tours are essential, especially in view of the above listed lack of information available to the visitor.
Tours are of most benefit to visiting students and specialists.
Garden tour operators are also given tours.
A charge of £15 to £20 per hour should be introduced for this service.
Current staffing levels are low in the SG's and time spent on tours puts a further strain on this situation.
LECTURES
Local management and key staff give lectures on their gardens and various other subjects relating to their specialist nature, both locally and further afield.
This service is of great benefit to the gardens.
A charge of £15 to £25 plus travel expenses should be introduced for this service.
As with the guided tours current staffing levels mean that the time spent on preparation etc. further adds to the strain on the system.
VISITOR CENTRES
Absent from all gardens.
The potential here for passing on information, and selling RBGE products, is almost limitless.
3a SCIENTIFIC DATA
A. Herbarium materials
1).
Preserved (mainly dried) specimens .
Estimated at over 1,000,000.
As there is no accessions register for individual herbarium specimens, a numerical reassessment of our holdings is required; this is under consideration for a summer student project in 1991.
Herbarium material provides a source of information for various purposes:—
a).
Material for taxonomic research.
b).
Support for plant identification services.
c).
Repository of voucher specimens for identifications used in, e.g. biogeographical, ecological, biomonitoring and experimental studies.
d).
Source of research material other than for mainstream taxonomy, e.g. molecular studies and environmental monitoring [heavy metal content etc.].
2).
Associated materials .
These include:—
a).
Field notebooks (some held in Library)— provide a back-up to data on specimen labels, and biographical information.
b).
Determination lists to important collecting expeditions
c).
Card index to collectors, giving biographical details and other information on collecting activities etc.
d).
Indexes to families, genera and species — some are now computerized.
Computerization of 2b, c, and d is desirable even for internal use.
Also under consideration is a register of type specimens held in E, this could be enhanced to be in the form of stored images on CD, and available for sale (as an alternative to microfiche).
B. Scientific databases (computer held).
With the exception of the Garden Records database, few, if any, databases exist at RBG in an advanced state.
Undoubtedly, databases not to be restricted to in-house use will soon be compiled at RBG, but need to be done so in the light of the rapid advancements being made internationally.
This is the remit of the Science SPG, but comments and suggestions are, of course, welcome.
3b STAFF KNOWLEDGE AND SPECIALISMS
A. Research Botanists.
Represented by HSO-SPSO (16), support staff at ASO-SO (c.8) and associates (c.5).
This is a small number compared with the numerical size of the plant kingdom (incl. fungi!) and the enormity of the biosphere.
Nevertheless, the expertise of the RBG staff encompasses most major plant groups (with the exception of some micro-organisms), at least to an ‘Alpha’ level, and field experience exists for most major geographical areas.
A detailed breakdown of the range and depth of experience is not attempted here, and should arise from the various questionnaires currently being circulated […?].
In addition to‘in-head’ knowledge, research botanist's files and materials hold a variety of information available by personal approaches to them, e.g.:—
a).
Field records, site data, incl. field notebooks.
b).
Data from other herbaria, personally gathered or acquired MS documents.
c).
Personal correspondence.
d).
Private books, reprints, MSS, unpublished theses, incl. material not represented in the Library.
e).
Illustrations, esp.
photographic slides — both private and official (the latter held for current research or teaching purposes).
B. Horticulturists.
At the more senior level (Supervisor to Curator), represented by c. 18 staff.
As with research botanists, the horticultural staff have wide knowledge and expertise, esp.
of plants and their cultivation, landscape design etc., and many have overseas experience in other botanic gardens or as members of collecting expeditions.
Similarly, they hold information-containing materials available upon personal application.
C. Other staff.
Included here are members of staff in the Library, Photographic, Publications and Public Services departments.
In addition to their knowledge and expertise in the activities for which they are currently employed, many have additional relevant experience (botanical, geological, horticultural) gained from previous employ or personal endeavour.
3c PUBLIC ENQUIRIES
Excluding library services, public enquiries fall in to two broad categories:
A. BGQ enquiries, mainly involving plant identifications and plant health and cultivation problems.
There are currently 370 BGQ enquiries per year.
B. Enquiries direct to staff, by phone, post or visitors.
There is no estimate of the number of such enquiries.
A. BGQ enquiries
During 1990, only two or three (c. 1%) BGQs have been of a commercial nature and have been charged for.
As the RBG develops a higher public profile, enquiries are likely to increase significantly.
Can the RBG afford to devote a significant increase in staff time to public enquiries?
At present the bulk of BGQs are dealt with by 6 members of the scientific and horticultural staff, who all have other duties to perform (incl. dealing with non-BGQ enquiries!).
For each enquiry (at a possibly conservative estimate):—
Scientist/Horticulturists time [HSO-PSO]50 mins
Clerical (ASO) 5
Typists 5
I.e. a total staff time of 370 hrs = c. 52 days per year.
The provision of a free enquiry service to the public does much to enhance the RBG's image, but the costs of this must be taken into account in our future planning, and the organization of the enquiry service (incl. spreading the workload) adjusted accordingly.
To impose a realistic charge (c. £20) for each enquiry, or even a reduced charge of say £10, would surely be counterproductive.
Few people would be prepared to pay such fees and BGQs would virtually disappear (arguably a benefit to RBG!).
Coupled with this there would certainly be a diminution in public regard and support for the RBG and its activities.
B. Other external enquiries
These are more difficult to qualify and quantify, in terms of their nature and time and other resources used.
Their nature is multifarious, but they are mainly from other professionals in other organizations or from informed amateur botanists or gardeners.
Many such enquiries are closely related to the expertise and official activities of the RBG staff member(s) concerned, and hence often benefit such activities in providing extra data, background (‘grapevine’) information, and in widening contacts that can be potentially exploited in the future.
A few examples of the nature of enquiry are:—
a).
Plant identifications — often of high quality, and often where material of high research value can be retained in E.
b).
Plant record information — e.g. locality, ecology etc.
c).
Advice on setting up research or horticultural projects.
d).
Refereeing MS papers, grant applications etc.
Staff time taken with such enquiries is difficult to evaluate and is probably underestimated in many Job Descriptions in Annual Staff Reports.
Other resources used mainly involve photocopying, typing, stationery, postage and telephone costs.
A system of charging for enquiries from other botanical, horticultural, or conservation bodies and informed amateurs would be difficult to establish and, in general, undesirable.
RBG staff regularly make such enquiries themselves and are seldom faced with a charge!
However, staff and line managers should be wary of an overcommitment of time and resources to enquiries, each to be individually assessed as to its merits (charging for materials where appropriate).
A rigid maxim for such matters would be impracticable.
3d COMMERCIAL ENQUIRIES
The following comments pertain only to enquiries which involve scientific, horticultural, photographic or library staff — even though the enquiry may have been handled initially by Public Services.
These enquiries are charged for and include requests from, e.g. architects, building consultants, landscape designers, publishers and other media organizations., and involve, for example;—
a).
Plant information — identification, significance (pathology, biodeterioration effects etc.), growing requirements.
b).
Requests for photographic materials/work.
c).
Requests for bibliographical information.
The income from enquiry services is, of course, beneficial to the RBG, but to what extent should the RBG actively seek such work?
Agreement to undertake a major consultancy or, for example, a large photographic request, is unlikely to cause many problems, as temporary staff can be employed to undertake much of the work (so long as RBG still makes an overall profit!).
Problems are more likely to arise from an increase in the number of small enquiries which generate only a modest income but which impinge on the time of core staff.
Consider also, that these same staff will be increasingly involved in grant-funded project work and RBG publication activities which have deadlines that must be met.
In this respect, keeping a balance of demand and supply will need careful handling during the next few years.
3e Library Enquiries
The Library routinely handles the following types of enquiry:
a)
Written
i)
Anything specifically addressed to the Library or its staff
ii)
Anything on the history of RBG
iii)
Biographical enquiries, including archival.
iv)
Enquiries on botanical literature
v)
Enquiries on botanical illustration
vi)
Other questions which can be answered easily from the library stock by non-specialists.
b)
Telephone
i)
Directory-type queries — addresses of organisations, providers of services, plants, etc.
ii)
Requests for basic information on plants — names etc — which can be answered easily from reference books.
iii)
Requests for illustrations of particular plants.
iv)
As (vi) above
c)
Personal visitors.
A complete range of enquiry services is available to personal callers — the variety is so large as to make description impossible.
The Library sees itself as a major provider of an enquiry service within RBGE, and also as a switching centre for specialist enquiries which we forward to the most appropriate staff for answer.
We have no mechanism for assessing the success or failure of forwarded enquiries.
We try to answer written enquiries within 24 hrs.
If we estimate that an enquiry will take us longer than ½ hr, we will advise that we cannot help, and that the caller should visit here and undertake their own research.
4a Visual Records and Facilities

Processing of Black and White materials both pos. and neg. including TEM and SEM
Colour printing for exhibitions and displays from reversal originals (from April 1991).
Preparation and execution of all work required for exhibits, posters etc.
Photography for special projects such as publications (books, guides, brochures etc.)
The Future
Within the next five years we should have moved into new (larger?) premises designed around a more ergonomic layout than the present facilities.
I foresee the photographic work becoming much more project oriented than it has been — for specific publications etc.
Areas to be looked at in the short term are:
i)
Lines of contact for external enquiries with a clearly defined costing structure.
ii)
Clear cost policy with regard to the various slide collections, especially the general slide collection.
This will include:
a)
Policy regarding the way in which the slides are mounted and stored.
b)
Weeding out below standard material (unless of special importance).
c)
Appointment of an agency to market the slides — providing they are of marketable quality.
The next five years
Slide Collection
This area has already been identified as a priority:
1.
I envisage a complete overhaul of the existing collection (at present in the care of Miss R M Smith), and responsibility for the collection transferred to the Photographic section.
2.
That at this time all material clearly below par will be ‘weeded out’ and replaced by new material when available.
3.
That all new slides be transferred to modern storage systems to facilitate easy retrieval.
4.
That all new material be labelled using a computer-based labelling system to enable, where available, additional information to be placed on the slide mount.
5.
That a computer-based catalogue be produced in association with library staff.
6.
That the slide collection be housed in a suitable location to enable all withdrawals and returns by staff and public to be carefully recorded.
The library would seem the most likely site at present.
7.
That a similar system be set up for the archival negative collections which would be rehoused within the proposed new photographic suite.
The next ten years.
That all the aforementioned images be transferred to a ‘compact disc’ storage system.
5 PUBLICATIONS Current Situation
The means by which much of the information held and generated at the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh is made available to a wider audience is in the form of publications.
Publications from the Garden fall into the following main categories:
a)
scientific publications in the form of journals or books (e.g. Edinburgh Journal of Botany, British Fungus Flora) aimed at the scientific community and the enthusiastic amateur
b)
guidebooks to the Gardens for the public at large 
c)
newsletters (e.g. The Botanics) giving information on Garden activities and exhibits etc for both the general public and potential sponsors
d)
leaflets/prospectuses of information by staff for potential sponsors of publications and further research
e)
financial/staff information in reports for the Board of Trustees/Parliament
f)
posters advertising activities, lectures and exhibitions
g)
Garden Notices and newsletters for internal circulation to staff
In some of the above categories the present Publication Officer functions alone and covers both in-house production of information (with the IT at her disposal) and organises external production (through HMSO and printers) of publications.
In both areas there is an acute shortage of expertise at the Garden.
The Future
Any Strategic Plan must involve improvement and expansion of channels of communication.
These would bear heavily on the Publication Officer and consideration must therefore be given to increasing staffing of the Publication Officer's ‘office’.
I would like to advance the idea of a high level officer — an Information Officer perhaps — whose job would be to take overall charge of information services at the Garden and address the basic questions:
a)
who needs information
b)
does it already exist
c)
in what form does it exist
d)
how can it be delivered to the user
e)
how good is the quality of:
i)
this information
ii)
delivery of this information
The function of this office would be:
i)
to be conversant with all sources of information at the Garden
ii)
to foresee the targets that might benefit from that information (or, as importantly, that on receipt of that information might benefit the Garden)
iii)
to arrange for that information to be channelled to the appropriate targets.
Under function iii) above, the Information Officer would work through the Publication Officer on those channels that would need to be generated in print de novo .
Comments
In essence CW's matrix table identifies a source of information, means by which that information can be communicated, and the targets for that information.
The list was amended by committee and on reflection, I think another important target should be added to several of the flow charts, namely, potential sponsors.
In most of those flow charts in which ‘means’ includes publication the Publication Officer currently has a role in actually providing the means.
In some (e.g. scientific publications) the Publication Officer also has the responsibility for disseminating the publication to the appropriate ‘targets’.
Currently the Publication Officer functions alone and covers both in-house production of information (with the IT at her disposal) and organises external production (through HMSO and printers) of publications.
In both areas there is an acute shortage of expertise in the Garden.
6a Garden Public
Existing Services
The Garden and its specialist collections receive up to 1 million visits per year from a very wide audience, national and international in character.
Their need for information is currently met in the following ways:
1 CONSTABULARY — Often the first point of contact, they deal with a wide range of enquiries (over 10,000 per year) on:
a)
Guidebook sales — official guides sold at entrance
b)
Location of plants, features, events within the Garden
c)
Closing times and routes through the Garden
d)
Local transport services (buses, taxis, trains)
e)
Places of interest outwith the Garden (Castle, Zoo, etc.)
2 HORTICULTURALISTS — Students and full-time staff in Edinburgh, and particularly in the specialist gardens, provide information to visitors on a regular basis.
3 SIGNS AND LABELLING — Information is provided in the following forms:
a)
Noticeboards, containing maps and current information on exhibitions and events.
b)
Signposting — An outdated and incomplete system of directional signs to garden features (planthouses, cafe etc).
Also, mobile display boards used to direct visitors to exhibitions.
c)
Plant labels — A small number of interpretive labels, mostly in the demonstration garden and glasshouses in addition to the species labels provided throughout.
4 TOURS — An experimental 45 minute audio tour of the planthouses, and guided tours when available.
5 PUBLICATIONS — Guidebooks for Edinburgh, Logan, Younger (out of print), botanical guidebooks for demonstration garden and planthouses, seasonal outdoor guides and tropical planthouse guide.
6b Exhibitions
Existing Services
Exhibitions represent a major means of delivering information about the Garden's role and work, to a wide audience.
Since 1986 over 1.5 million visitors have attended exhibitions at the following venues:
1)
At RBG — Inverleith House, Exhibition Hall, Caledonian Hall, Herbarium.
2)
Touring exhibitions throughout Scotland and England.
In addition to the exhibitions themselves, information is also provided by exhibition/sales attendants, lectures and workshops, catalogues and leaflets, publicity (press, radio and television features, advertisements).
Exhibition publications and publicity are a valuable means of delivering information on an international basis.
The exhibitions programme is designed to appeal to the whole spectrum of our visiting public, through a mixture of:
i)
Interpretive exhibitions (e.g. Garden in the Desert)
ii)
Art exhibitions (e.g. Andy Goldsworthy)
iii)
Horticultural Show displays (e.g. RHS Ingliston)
Specialist users of such information include:
1.
Teachers/Lecturers at all levels (life sciences, pure and applied art)
2.
Students and those involved in private study.
3.
Professionals with specific interests.
Exhibitions are also geared to raising our profile to stimulate the demand for information, and attracting sponsorship funding to assist in their production and promotion.
In addition, routine requests for information about exhibitions and related events are dealt with by exhibition staff — telephone, written and personal enquiries.
7 Public and Media Relations
1.

ii)
Finance
As previous:
a.
Charging out of administration and estates overheads to cost centres.
This will give more up-to-date costings.
b.
Point of sale link to new publications sales shop to provide detailed analysis in stocks movement and turnover per annum.
Will provide detailed analysis on sales.
c.
Stock control for garden store, monitoring movement of stocks and providing expenditure information by type and department.
iii)
Personnel
When payroll on line to Chessington full use of software packages to provide information on computer is envisaged.
In addition management information on staff complement and cost of adjusting or increasing complement will be produced.
Next ten years
i) Financial Management.
A new software package to operate on the local area network of PCs in Administration has been selected and is currently being tested for implementation early in the financial year 1991-1992.
All records on the existing Altos minicomputer system will have by that time been transferred to users’ PCs and it will become surplus to requirements.
(Consideration being given to possible use by Public Services for retail cash sales etc).
The new financial management software is more powerful and flexible and is capable of providing a wide range of management information.
The development of income raising schemes and projects will significantly increase the pressure of work on the Finance Section, even when linked directly to the Bank's own Royline and while it is envisaged that the existing system should be able to meet requirements for the next four or five when replacement will be under consideration, additional staff will probably be required.
Requirements beyond a five year period will depend on the extent of RBG financial activity and the replacement systems available on the market by that time.
The development of income raising schemes and projects will significantly increase the pressure of work on the Finance Section, even when linked directly to the Bank's own Royline and while it is envisaged that the existing system should be able to meet requirements for the next four or five years when replacement will be under consideration, additional staff will probably be required.
Requirements beyond a five year period will depend on the extent of RBG financial activity and the replacement systems available on the market by that time.
ii) Payroll and Personnel.
The extension of the current contract with Chessington Computer Centre for a further two years will provide time to assess the various options open to RBG for the processing of payroll.
There are a number of imponderables at the present time e.g. the rates to be charged by CCC when it becomes an agency in 1992, the high annual cost of a direct link, the number of and cost of training staff to prepare data for processing at a bank or internally with a software package available on a PC system.
The transfer of personnel data will depend on options adopted for payroll; if a direct link to Chessington is approved, personnel information will be readily accessible without extra charge.
However if that is not possible a personnel software package will require to be purchased for the PCs already available.
It is likely therefore whatever option is selected an extra £5000 per annum may be required.
In the longer term the objective would be to process payroll and personnel work internally and a replacement system may be powerful enough to allow use of a tailored software package from Chessington.
iii) Central Stores
A start has been made to operate stock control of a central garden store for supplies, materials and equipment as part of the Administration LAN.
It is envisaged that orders for stores and for all other cost centres will be transmitted electronically in the near future.
iv) Estates.
The equipment already purchased for estates work is at present unlinked to the LAN but may be in the future for more efficient financial management.
Plans of RBG buildings on microfiche are available from PSA and in the future may be available on disk for the PC running Autocad software.
Records of building maintenance are already being created and will be available for potential users.
No significant additions to IT are envisaged in the foreseeable future but as RBG becomes more independent and estates staff and records increase a review in five years will be essential.
v) Summary
No major spend on equipment is foreseen in the next 2 or 3 years until the existing LAN requires replacement when a full review of requirements would be necessary.
APPENDIX B
The Information Matrices, and analysis
It has not been possible to produce a diagram modelling our use of information services — it would have required at least four dimensions to deal with the different aspects.
Instead, the three matrix tables below show, against particular resources, the main users, resource management tools, and types of use.
This paper derives from an analysis of the matrix tables, and is intended as a basis for discussion.
Many of the categories of resource can be further sub-divided, e.g. Computer data includes plant records, mailing lists and other databases, financial data, estate plans, etc.
I have distinguished between Informational publications, and scientific publications.
From one of our meetings, it was apparent that there was a demand for horticultural publication which was not currently being met.
This is a further category which should be added in future.
The term ‘Staff contact’ is used to refer to the information resource represented by the telephonist/receptionist; the constabulary; and the garden staff encountered by the public in the gardens.
A plus sign (+) signifies substantial use, whereas a query sign (?) indicates more limited, but still significant, correlation.
No quantitative values have been assigned.
1.
Information users
It is recognized that staff use information resources both in furtherance of their own interests, and to answer particular enquiries.
‘External researchers’ refers to those workers who are attached in various ways to the RBG, and Public includes all other RBG users.
The use made of our resources by external institutions , as distinct from individuals, is at present a relatively small factor, which could increase considerably in the future if we decide to implement co-operative research strategies.
It is in this area that our communications facilities will require to be strengthened and developed within the next five years.
Internally, the routine use of electronic mail should cut down the amount of paper which passes between staff, and may reduce workload on support staff.
Staff writing papers should be able to send files direct to DTP electronically, for the preparation of camera-ready copy.
Finance staff should be using the network to extract financial data from computerised cost centres, such as the library, and cost-centre managers should be able to access up-to-date expenditure and commitment figures on-line.
Externally, we should be implementing X-25 communication protocols to exchange scientific information between institutions, to improve data exchange facilities between gardens, and to link Payroll and Finance to external services.
The matrix only shows outputs, and does not reflect the staff input into these activities.
Scientific and horticultural staff should have inputs into labels, signs, exhibitions, etc.; staff in contact with the public should receive regular, formal training from the relevant scientific or horticultural staff; library staff should be in receipt of information from all departments to support their activities, and so on.
The public comes into contact with our information resources at most points, with the exception of some of the more specialised sources which we use internally, such as computer data, administration files, and communications.
We should consider the possibility of public access to some of our computer data, through the use of public access catalogues (library); enquiry modules on databases (horticultural information); and interactive video (exhibitions, horticultural information, scientific data, informative ‘publications’).
The external researchers use most of the same resources as our scientific staff.
Since they are mostly overseas workers undertaking taxonomic or project-based research, this is understandable.
We should have provision for granting supervised access to the same resources as staff.
We require information from the Science Strategy Group as to their views on the future of collaborative research projects.
The horticultural education students mainly use the library's resources.
Computing will become a larger part of the course from 1992 onwards, arising out of the Course Review, and there are likely to be increasing demands for specialist hardware (plotters), software (spreadsheets, databases, graphics), and improved access to scientific and horticultural data through better communications.
Staff require access to most information resources in order to answer enquiries.
In turn, they require to have up-to-date information on Garden activities, and external events, in order to provide accurate information.
There is a need for good internal communications, and an accepted policy on enquiry handling.
Staff use all information resources as part of their on-going work, whether scientific, horticultural, educational, or support.
They should also be able to call on information technology, in the form of good computers, software, presentational aids, and communication facilities.
Investment in these areas should be an RBG priority in the next few years.
2.
Information management.
It is immediately apparent from this matrix that most of our information resources lack efficient means for exploiting those resources.
It is suggested that there is here the potential for considerable development, taking advantage of information technology to make the information held here available to the maximum number of people, inside and outside the organization.
The improvement of our management of information should be the major thrust of our information services strategy for the next five years.
Almost all areas require work, but we should be able to agree priorities for short and long terms.
The mere listing of resources is not enough — we need to be able to gain rapid access to data contained in these resources, through databases, text retrieval packages, geographic information systems, and image databases.
It is recognized that any programme of improving information management will cost money, in the form of staff and equipment, but any money spent will result in opening up the wealth of our information resources to larger numbers of people.
It is suggested that we should develop in co-operation, or at least in parallel, with similar organizations, so that we do not paint ourselves into a corner with incompatible technologies.
It is further suggested that funding for such a programme might be available through the European Community's information technology programmes.
3.
Information use.
The uses to which our information resources are put have been sub-divided, to see if there is any correlation between the resource and the mode of use.
Scientific: the use of information in pursuit of scientific research.
Horticultural: the use for garden management, research, and amenity purposes.
Enquiry: the use to satisfy demands for answers to specific questions.
Informational: the use to guide and inform visitors.
Educational: the use as an adjunct to our teaching activities.
Lecture: the use in connection with our external and internal lecturing work.
Publication: the use for the production of scientific, informational, and horticultural literature.
Training: the use in connection with our horticultural education programme.
Evidential: the retention of data as a permanent record of our activities.
Another type of use is for Sales and Marketing, which is expected to grow considerably in the future.
This function will tend to concentrate on the visual image and publications resources.
There are other higher-level categories, such as Strategic, which requires information from all areas for planning purposes; Managerial, which similarly needs data for day-to-day working; Operational, which relates to the way in which particular programmes are implemented.
These higher-level functions are not, it is suggested, currently receiving all of the necessary information.
Indeed in some cases it is possible that responses are made to those whose communication channels are working most efficiently, but not to those whose channels are blocked or filtered.
These channels should be reflected in the RBG's management structure, and there should be an efficient means of collecting, using, and distributing information within management, and between managers and staff.
The patterns of information use suggest that staff frequently cross departmental ‘boundaries’ in search of data, and such inter-departmental activities should be encouraged by a management structure which permits the free flow of information throughout the Garden.

Advertising/Promotion Options
Visitor numbers
In 1990 visitor numbers for Parks and Gardens in the UK increased by 4% (BTA figures).
Kew had 1.2 million visitors and Edinburgh Castle had 1 million (both attractions have an admission charge).
It is also worth noting that attendances at Museums and Art Galleries were up by 6%, which is encouraging in relation to art exhibitions in Inverleith House.
RBG Edinburgh recorded 786,000 visits in 1990, although it is probably a minimum figure and with more careful monitoring of ALL visitor numbers, including educational activities and special groups, a more accurate figure should be available for 1991.
Our Specialist Gardens recorded an increase in visits during 1990:
Younger Botanic Garden: 47,177
Logan Botanic Garden: 39,000
Dawyck Botanic Garden: 9,400
Visitor Survey
In the 1990's we must begin to cater properly for our visitors — tourists and local regulars.
Our Visitor Survey for Edinburgh (undertaken in 1987/1988) showed that Edinburgh received an estimated 312,000 individual VISITORS, making three quarters of a million VISITS.
Any future marketing and promotional strategies must take into account the desirability of increasing the number of new visitors, particularly tourists, by promoting RBG effectively to tourists in Edinburgh, outside Edinburgh and overseas.
They must also be targeted to attract visitors to all four gardens at ‘quiet’ times of the year and during weekdays.
Particular attention must be paid to marketing targeted at coach and travel operators, in Britain and overseas, for all four gardens.
It is appropriate that this is done through the relevant Tourist Boards and their overseas joint marketing schemes.
The survey told us that we had very few 11-19 year old visitors — an age group now catered for increasingly by our educational activities.
However we have a higher than average proportion of 25-39 year olds and 60-69 year olds.
The retired, employed and those in full-time education form a substantial part of our visitor population.
The social class of visitors is dominated by the professional and middle classes (A's and B's).
This should be considered very carefully when planning visitor facilities, provision of goods, services, information and promotional campaigns.
The majority of our visitors are at present local ie Edinburgh and Lothians (63%).
Overseas visitors (mainly from North America, Canada, Australia and New Zealand and Europe) comprised 11%.
The remaining 26% are from the remainder of Scotland and the rest of the UK.
ADVERTISING
Costs for April 1990-March 1991
RBG Edinburgh: £2150
Logan: £2000
Dawyck: £2100
Younger: £1400
Total: £7650 plus VAT
In addition a sum of approximately £6000 was spent on exhibition advertising.
No agency is engaged to handle the account, therefore there are reductions on costs through direct negotiation with press and publications and no Agency fees.
Advertising for the 4 gardens is currently handled by P and M Relations Officer.
Advertising of exhibitions is handled jointly with the Exhibitions Officer, with the budget being allocated to exhibitions.
All ads can be produced to camera ready stage in-house to a standard format and design, with us negotiating advertising costs directly with the publications concerned.
When Public Services has DTP facilities, creative design of ALL advertisements, leaflets, posters etc will be possible by Public Services design staff.
Kew currently has an advertising budget of £20,000, which does not include Wakehurst Place.
RBG AS A TOURIST ATTRACTION AND MEMBERSHIP OF TOURIST BOARDS
a) 1990/91 Membership
Dumfries and Galloway Tourist Board £ 64.00
Cowal and District Tourist Board £ 40.00
Scottish Borders Tourist Board £200.00
Scottish Tourist Board FREE
Other Organisations
Scotland's Border Heritage £200.00
Edinburgh Marketing £300.00
Assoc.
Scottish Visitor Attractions £ 50.00
Edinburgh Galleries Association £280.00 (includes monthly advertising)
Annual Total, excluding VAT £1134
b) It is vitally important that we maintain our association with these organisations and continue to receive the benefits of membership.
As membership fees increase, budgets have to accommodate this.
Fees increase annually, therefore budget allocations have to accommodate this.
Most of the advertising for our Specialist Gardens relates to Tourist Publications, this needs to be expanded in future to include more Tour Operator's Guides.
PROMOTIONAL CAMPAIGNS
a) A co-ordinated, high profile campaign should be undertaken to introduce and reinforce our new corporate identity; identify RBG Edinburgh as a key Tourist attraction AND an important and dynamic scientific institution; make people aware of our Specialist Gardens, their role and location.
This should be planned during 1991/92, ready for implementation in 1992/3 (dependent on funding).
This could involve a bus campaign; prime-site advertising campaign within Edinburgh; poster and leaflet campaign (for all 4 gardens) in Tourist Information Centres throughout the U.K, other visitor attractions, accommodation and entertainment venues throughout Scotland.
b) As visitor facilities at YBG Younger, Logan and Dawyck are further developed, future campaigns over the next 5-10 years should highlight these sites specifically, as appropriate.
A further increase in advertising and promotions budget will be required to promote developments at the Specialist Gardens over the next 5-10 years, with each garden requiring its own advertising/promotional budget.
Edinburgh Zoo, for 1 site, had a budget in 1990 of over £65,000 per year for advertising, including highly effective bus campaigns.
In 1991 their TV campaign alone cost in the region of £75,000.
c) ESTIMATED COSTS:
i) BUS CAMPAIGN (Through Primesite Bus Advertising Ltd.)
Whole LRT double deck bus painted in colour to RBG individual design, including advertising panels inside and out, enabling us to get various types of information across to a very wide audience.
The desired route within Edinburgh city centre and outskirts can be chosen and sponsorship could be sought to cover part or all of the cost,(with the sponsors name appearing prominently on the bus).
This is the most effective form of advertising apart from television, which is very expensive.
All design work to be undertaken in-house.
Painting of Bus (45 days work) £3900
Rental of bus (including RBG's use of the £ 600 per month
bus for our own PR purposes, outings etc.) for 12 months
For 24 month campaign, with no additional £ 600 per month
painting costs 12 month campaign would cost: £11,100 plus VAT
As a less effective alternative —
T.SHAPES (next best campaign to whole bus) T.Shapes on 5/10 buses (similar to the Edinburgh Zoo campaign) backed up by interior panels.
This could also be attractive to a sponsor.
Unfortunately we could not choose our routes under this scheme.
Per T.Shape (5 buses) £ 160 per month
Per Interior panel (minimum 15 panels) £ 15 per month
12 month campaign would cost: £12,300 plus VAT
ii) ADVERTISING IN RAILWAY AND BUS STATIONS/AIRPORTS
In order to get tourists and day trippers down to Inverleith it is important that we have advertisements prominently placed in bus and railway stations.
This is a very cheap and effective form of advertising.
Any campaign could include:
Edinburgh — Haymarket, Waverley and St. Andrews Square, Airport
Glasgow — Queen Street, Central and Bus station, Airport
60’ x 40’space Per ad, per site up to £80 per month plus VAT
Airport sites — per ad, per site up to £200 per month plus VAT
iii) POSTER/LEAFLET CAMPAIGN
A set of colour posters for all four gardens should be designed in-house and A4 versions distributed through Tourist Information Centres, other Visitor Attractions and Entertainment venues, Guest Houses, Hotels, Campsites etc.
These could be designed so that A2 versions could be sold through our retail outlets to visitors (in a similar way to exhibition posters) thus recovering a major part of the production and printing costs.
These would have a life of up to 5 years, before being redesigned.
This would be an on-going promotional campaign along the lines of what we already do, but with more co-ordination and the addition of posters and a greater number of redesigned Promotional leaflets (to replace existing ones).
A constant problem with promoting all four gardens is that we never have enough leaflets to supply all the outlets that request them.
5,000 A2 (for sale) and 20,000 A4 posters for Edinburgh
1,000 A2 (for sale) and 5,000 A4 posters for each of the Specialist Gardens
Estimated cost: £12,000 including VAT
LEAFLETS
Redesigned A4 colour four Gardens Leaflet (500,000)
Estimated cost: £7,000 including VAT
Redesigned ⅓ A4 colour leaflets for Specialist Gardens
50,000 for each garden
Estimated cost: £3,000 including VAT
MEDIA COVERAGE, FILMS/VIDEOS AND WRITTEN ARTICLES FOR PUBLICATION
Films and Videos
i) RBG is being increasingly approached to collaborate with the making of series and one-off programmes for television.
There are obvious PR advantages in cooperating with such projects when approached, sometimes financial benefits can be achieved as well, where companies are prepared to pay substantial sums for the use of our facilities for filming.
However, a significant amount of staff time is often involved, mainly relating to the P and M Relations Officer, but often Constabulary, Horticultural, Exhibitions, Educational and Estates staff.
We can and do sometimes charge for this time, but where there are significant PR benefits for the Garden and its activities, and companies are not willing to pay, we do not charge.
If we marketed our facilities to companies dealing with fashion shoots or promotional advertising, for example, on a purely commercial basis, the financial benefits could be substantial over a 12 month period.
Agencies exist in Scotland to find locations for film and video companies and they know what facilities we can offer, on a commercial basis.
The commercial use of our facilities for filming/photography etc. in future could come under the remit of the Business Development Director, in liaison with Public Services.
The RBG film ‘The Capital Garden’, sponsored by the Bank of Scotland and made in the 1970's, is in an unusable format (16mm), and badly in need of replacement.
We urgently need a promotional video — one of the most effective tools to communicate with a wide audience — which we can show to groups and visitors within RBG; send out on loan to groups, schools and other organisations, and use as a vehicle to promote ourselves to potential sponsors and supporters.
The new video would need to be produced by a professional company to high technical quality, with significant input at all stages from RBG staff.
We are currently negotiating with various companies who are eager to produce a video for us.
Funding in the form of sponsorship must be found within the next 12 months to enable this project to go ahead.
Estimated cost: £60,000
In addition substantial staff time and co-operation will be required.
Videos for Sale
There could be a significant financial return and obvious promotional benefits for the RBG, if we were to become involved with the production of videos about our gardens and/or gardening in general for the popular/tourist market, for sale through our own and other retail outlets.
We have been approached by a video company interested in collaborating with production and marketing, but this would require funding in order to go ahead — costs could be recovered through sales.
Such a product may also be suitable for sponsorship, with a sponsor's name on the product and at point of sale displays etc.
Estimated cost: £30,000
Staff time would be significant in the planning stages, less so during filming and post production.
It may be possible to combine these functions by re-editing material for the sell-through market and using the same company, thus making the whole exercise more cost-effective.
A Discovery Guide is being developed for YBG, which will be produced ready for the 1992 visitor season.
This will include a map of the trail, information and suggested educational/fun activities.
It will be A5 format and attractively produced with a laminated waterproof cover.
It will be sold at YBG, thus eventually recovering all the production costs.
An ex-scientific illustration student from the Blackpool College will help to produce the illustrations and design for the pack in September 1991.
Estimated cost £2000 (including initial one-off development costs)
500 will be produced initially and sold at £2/£2.50 each
A colour leaflet could be produced for the trail which would be available free of charge to visitors.
This would be an attractive project for local sponsorship.
Estimated cost for 100,000 £3000
Appendix D Scientific Computing
Floras and monographs.
In terms of their information content, conventional floras contain lists of names of plants, with descriptions and illustrations, and keys for identification.
Monographs may also contain additional illustrations, and maps showing distributions of individual taxa.
In both cases, access to the data will be limited by the physical format of the printed work.
Searching is limited to the use of the printed index, which is usually only to plant names.
No other analysis is normally possible, and synthesis — using the taxonomic information to make meaningful generalisations available for other plant sciences such as evolution, ecology, genetics, plant breeding, plant pathology etc — is made laborious.
Taxonomy should be a common descriptive backbone to research in plant sciences, but the way in which it is conventionally presented makes such use difficult for the non-taxonomist.
The process of publishing conventional floras and monographs is very inefficient and expensive.
Much more data are collected than it is possible to publish, and access to this additional information is just not possible — indeed its existence may not be known or recorded, with the result that future researchers and revisers have to go through the whole data collection procedure again each time.
The use of computers within taxonomy is developing rapidly in response to these perceived limitations.
Conventional taxonomic publications can still be produced using computers, but much more rapidly and cheaply.
The original data, if recorded within standard data formats in databases, can now be analysed more thoroughly, and in novel combinations, to produce new insights into plant relationships.
Additional types of data, such as geographic, image, bibliographic and text files, can be held in central data stores and called on as needed using advanced software to write new floristic and monographic works, to examine unpublishable data, and to provide information in other forms to researchers, horticulturalists, students at all levels, and the general public.
The import of data from molecular and genetic databases also holds out the promise of revitalising classical taxonomy using molecular systematics and DNA-probe analysis.
Most conventional databases are designed to handle textual and numerical information.
The information is placed within specific fields, each and all of which form a data dictionary which enables the information to be used to search and organise the data.
Taxonomic databases for flora and monograph writing require large fields for descriptive text.
Searching such large fields requires that either each significant word in the field is indexed for rapid searching, or that the database contains a routine for comparing and matching character strings.
One either needs enormous amounts of computer storage space for a very large data dictionary, or one needs very fast data processing for string searching.
Either alternative makes heavy demands on computing power, particularly on networked systems.
Specific text retrieval programs have been developed, such as CDS/ISIS and HeadFast, to reduce these difficulties, and within the Apple Macintosh environment Hypercard-based applications offer additional advantages in allowing additional types of data, such as digitised image files and video data, to be integrated.
All floras and many monographs need geographical information as part of their basic data — maps of distributions, gazetteer data, and environmental data such as soils, climates, geology, altitudes and aspects.
Such information is often laboriously collected by literature-searching and is conventionally processed as text.
Geographical Information Systems (GIS) are designed to store and manipulate such data.
They can, for example, digitise outline maps, generate percentage distribution maps from point data input, transform co-ordinates, incorporate place-names from gazetteer databases into maps, and print base-maps and overlays on suitable plotters.
Within RBGE, C. Will has previous experience of using GIS software, including GKS, GIMMS, CARTO-NET and ARC-INFO with ORACLE-based interfaces on Vax and InterGraph hardware, and he also has contacts with software developers and hardware users in Edinburgh University Geography Department and British Geological Survey (including Overseas Geological Surveys).
We should assess the current and future requirements for GIS within RBGE, to determine whether or not it would be cost-effective to acquire our own expertise and hardware in-house, or contract out our GIS work.
It is essential that the flora writers themselves should make contacts with GIS users to assess the possibilities of these systems for their own work.
Neural networks offer another possibility for use in identification, but they are still at an early stage of development.
They work by generalising solutions derived from an iterative pattern recognition process, to ‘train’ themselves.
So far, they have worked with data which is relatively easy to characterise and to discriminate.
It remains to be seen if they have applicability to the much more complex discriminant analysis problems routinely undertaken by classical taxonomists.
There are some fundamentals for the development of taxonomic information systems.
The first of these is the development and use of data standards; we need to know that our data is in a form which is usable by other institutions.
This standardisation work is, of necessity, international, although individual standards are developed by individual institutions or groups.
The Taxonomic Database Working Group (TDWG), on which RBGE is represented, is concerned with the development of several standards, including those required for data transfer.
The International Association for Plant Taxonomy (IAPT) is working on a plant name standard — Names in Current Use (NICU); Kew is working on authority name abbreviations; bibliographic standards include BPH for periodical names and TL-2 for taxonomic literature; the DELTA standard descriptive language has been written by Mike Dallwitz; standard geographic descriptors written by ISO and others exist, and further work is in progress on standards for recording conservation status.
The Future
Software Trends
The computer industry is the most rapidly changing one in the world at present.
Cheaper memory, faster processors, and larger storage devices, come onto the market with increasing rapidity.
Changes in software are probably not as rapid as hardware, but some trends are becoming clearer.
Operating systems were previously written for three different hardware environments — mainframes, minis, and PCs.
PCs ran DOS if IBM-compatible, or MAC systems for Apples.
(Most botanists currently use DOS).
Mainframes ran hardware-specific systems, such as VMS (DEC-Vax) or CMS (IBM).
Multi-user minis predominantly ran Unix, in one of its many non-standardised variants.
The introduction of Local Area Networks (LANs) and large workstations has led to the development of Open Systems Integration (OSI) in which different machines can be operated within a single network running whatever operating system is appropriate for specific applications on individual workstations.
What users see on their machines is trending towards Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs), where icons representing programs, and pull-down menus within programs, are manipulated using a mouse.
This is a highly intuitive environment which cuts down on training needs, but it is not to everyone's taste, and it needs more development work behind the scenes if we have to write bespoke software.
A great deal of other software is become transparently compatible, so that data can be shared between database programs, word processors, and graphics software, using multi-tasking operating systems.
Library Subscriptions & Exchanges.
In view of the high cost of subscriptions, D Mann asked C Will if he could prepare a list of current subscriptions, and current exchanges, to see if the Librarian could identify journals which were no longer needed for our work programme.
C Will agreed to put this in hand, and estimated that it would take about two months to complete.

Discussion on other VGR topics in April Agenda Item 4.
Group discussed relationship between Visiting Group Report, Strategic Plan, and Corporate Plan.
It was agreed that further discussion was needed.
Some members had not yet had the opportunity to study the Report and the Trustees response.
The importance of Science in the Corporate Plan was emphasised, and there was agreement that the Group should have the opportunity as soon as possible to discuss the Strategic Plan for Science in toto .
Feedback from the Trustees’ discussion of the Plan would also be useful.
It was suggested that the next Informal Group meeting should be used to discuss how we proceed, with the following Formal meeting being devoted to implementation.
It is essential that Mrs G Lomas be kept informed of our deliberations, so that she can incorporate any revision of the Science Plan in her final document.
5.
Bamboo Project.
NTR, but DL made the point that, welcome though this project is, he had not been informed of it until quite late in the planning stage.
It was agreed that RMG should establish a register of proposed and current research projects involving RBGE accommodation and support services (including photographic & laboratory materials, computing facilities & library services), so that those responsible for providing such backup are aware of likely demands at a very early stage.
6.

DFC reported that Herbarium Committee were looking at options at the East end of the top floor.
RW suggested that the Group should consider using S Clarke's old office for some of the new researchers who will be arriving shortly.
10
AOB.
CW distributed copies of a letter from Dr Alf Game of UKRHEEO following the meeting of 30 March.
Agreed that discussion be deferred to a later meeting, but the view was expressed that a register of RBGE EC research interests should be held by RMG through CW.
4.
Visiting Group Report — Specific Points
Para 35 — Floristics.
The Group felt that the VG statement was too sweeping, and that the change in the balance between floristic and monographic research should not be seen as downgrading floristics.
36/51 — UG7 post.
The Group felt that the proposed role was unworkable at UG7 level.
There are alternative options, including a post at UG6 level, or appointing two SO/HSO Band I recruits, etc.
It was felt that there are internal candidates of sufficient calibre, with experience within the organization, and knowledge of higher plants, who could be considered.
37 —Rhododendron monograph.
DFC to examine possibilities in about 4 years’ time, after results of US DNA-sequencing experiments and Flora Sinica Rhododendron account become available.
40/41 — Strategic Plan.
The Group agreed that input should be incorporated in the Corporate Plan.
42 — Horticultural Research.
The Group felt that there is scope for limited horticultural research in support of scientific work.
45 — Fund-raising.
The rle of the Deputy Keeper vis--vis individual researchers in fund-raising is not yet clearly defined.
47 — Modern techniques.
The Group noted VG comment, but felt that we were already applying modern techniques where appropriate.
The EC Biotechnology Framework Programme recognises the importance of classical taxonomy to genetic and molecular studies, and it is felt that collaborative research offers the best way forward in combining different the approaches.
We are already working along these lines.
48 — Career Development/Service Roles.
The Group noted this, and suggests further discussion on options for staffing support services.
51 — Increasing staff.
The Group notes and agrees.
Discussion on UG7 post in 36 above.
61 — Living Collections.
This question is related to 51.
It was agreed that better scientific use should be made of the living collections.
66 — Alpine Garden.
The Group agreed with the Trustees’ comments.
67 — Journal.
The Group does not share the doubts expressed by the VG on the cost-effectiveness of the Journal, but agrees that the possibilities of joint publication should be explored.
5.
Role of taxonomy in the study of biodiversity.
The paper by JAR was tabled for future discussion.
6.
Internal Travel.
The Group expressed concern over the statement that estimates submitted were incomplete.
At least one member of the Group had submitted estimates which do not appear in the list.
The Group was extremely concerned about the overall small size of the budget, and suggests that if additional funds are not made available, the scientific work of some staff will be hindered.
BC suggested that the inclusion of Photographic travel costs within Science was inappropriate.
These estimates should come from the funds allocated to Publication production costs.
7.
Committees.
The Group noted this paper, and requested that the terms of reference and reporting bodies for these Committees should also be recorded.
Copies of committee minutes should be deposited in the Library.
8.
Any Other Business.
DFC raised the issue of accommodation.
Twelve medium- to long-term visitors were scheduled to come to the Herbarium, and he would have to look at areas other than the Herbarium to accommodate them.
Some suggested areas are the Mounters’ Room, and the room currently occupied by Kit Tan.
It was suggested that standard-sized boxes or crates be obtained for visitors to use for Herbarium sheets which needed to be moved around.
DFC agreed to supply RMG with a list of the visitors he was expecting.
It was agreed that he, RW, and CW should be given advance warning of the arrival of new research workers, in order to assess requirements for space, laboratory facilities, library and computing services.
Date of Next Meeting: 28 April (Informal)

Currently held on (mostly) typed cards, this could form a database of taxonomic papers, covering cryptogamic taxa not included in Kew's Record of Taxonomic Literature.
Retrieval currently only possible under highest-level taxon included in paper — family or genus.
Scanning would extend indexing to all terms included on card.
12,000 entries.
Hard disk storage feasible, standard OCR program.
2.
RBGE Conifer Project.
Chris Page wants to capture Alan Mitchell's tree measurement data, currently held in hand-written form on cards in the Library.
Need sophisticated OCR program, which could be costly.
Second phase would be to capture Chris' data held on about 20,000 cards, and integrate this with Aljos Farjon's data already held on disk.
3.
Archive Records.
Still considering whether to go for microfilm with computer-aided retrieval, or a DIP (document image processing) system.
Costs about £25,000 (microfilm) or £50,000 (small DIP system).
4.
Library Image Database.
GEAC proposal about £37,000 initially.
Computer Network Shut-Down Procedures in power emergencies.
Note: Server names are RBG-1 (Science),RBG-2 (Admin) and RBG (Library)
1.
If Colin Will is around, he should be contacted first.
If unavailable, follow these procedures.
2.
If time is critical, type DOWN (& return) on all three server consoles; if asked to force disconnections, reply Y (and return).
Switch off at back of machines (RBG-1 and –2) or side (RBG — in Library)
3.
If you have time available, try to get users to log out of the system before shutting it down.
Switch on the PC which sits beside the two terminals in the Computer Room (it's the only one).
When you see the prompt (C: \>) type F:(don't forget the colon:)
You will then get a LOGIN> prompt.
Type login rbg-1/supervisor (& return)
Type password when asked for it (Separate sheet)
You should end up with a PUBLIC> prompt.
Type fconsole (return)
Use cursor (arrow) key to go down to Connection Information, then return.
This will tell you who is connected to the server.
If no-one is connected, use procedure 2.
If users are on the system, hit the <Esc> key, then cursor down to Broadcast Console Message and return.
Type ‘Emergency Shut-down.
Log out NOW ’ and return.
Go back to Connection Information and check that users are logging out.
Allow about 3 minutes for this, if you have the time, cursor down to Down File-Server and return, forcing disconnections when asked.
From the same console, log in to the other two servers and follow exactly the same procedures, except that you type login rbg-2/supervisor and login rbg/supervisor, using the other passwords supplied.
Switch off servers and console after downing servers.
4.
To reboot the systems, just switch them back on again and keep hitting returns when asked about loading VAPs etc.
I'll tidy files up later.
Slide Library
Notes on a meeting held 13.2.92, between S Clarke, D White & C Will.
The purpose of the meeting was to discuss the arrangements for the management of the Slide Library after the retirement of R M Smith, in line with the relevant sections of the Strategic Plan for Information Services.
The meeting also took note of a memo from D G Mann to C Will.
1.
Database
It is essential to use the same system for the Reference Collection (Photographic Department) and the Loan Collection (Library).
Both collections should be filed in systematic sequence, to allow for browsing by genus and species.
The filing sequence should be uniquely identified by a ‘reference number’ of alphanumeric codes, built up as follows:
[First three letters of genus][First two letters of species][4-digit sequential numbers, 0-prefix for backlog, 1-prefix for new accessions][Copy number]Since the meeting, it has been agreed that the numerical part of the number will be a sequential accession number.
This will not change the filing sequence.
This code is the only lettering which Photographic Department will actually write on the slide mount, so slide labels are not necessary at the moment.
(Slide borrowers may wish to write their own description on the mount at their own discretion.)
One field — <Plant accession> — will act as the link to BG-BASE.
Other fields are suggested as follows:
The database may take quite some time to establish, but if networked it will enable scientific, garden, library and photographic staff to check for the existence of a slide before new work is undertaken, thus saving time and money.
At least one PC will be required in Photographic Department for data input work.
2.
Location and responsibility for loan collection.
Ultimately, the Loan Collection should be within the ‘Media’ Room in the Herbarium/Library Extension.
In the meantime, it is essential that the collection is sited in a room where adequate supervision can be exercised.
We recommend that the room currently used by off-duty Messengers would be suitable.
Both Librarian and Chief Photographer need to work closely together on the administration of the collection, and we do not foresee any difficulty in this area.
Some curatorial functions, such as expenditure on slide mounts, are clearly the province of Photographic Dept, while others, such as the database as catalogue, are Library-oriented.
We need to have clarification of the role Helen Hoy would be expected to play in the new set-up.
We also need to ensure that the Archival Collection is housed in a secure, controlled environment, with indexing links to the document archive.
3.
Loans system.
If the slides are held in pockets in filing cabinets, a simple paper loan slip giving borrower name and date can be left in the pocket in place of slides borrowed.
Slides would be available for public reference, and for loan to RBGE staff and students.
The Library specifically does not want to be involved in Public Services’ commercial loan scheme for publishers.
We would issue slides to PS staff and let them run the charging system themselves.
4.
Other issues.
We wish to draw attention to the problems posed by the retention by some staff of slides which, under the terms of the Copyright Act, are the property of RBGE.
Copies should always be housed in the Reference and Loan collections.


Health & Safety — Display Screen Equipment.
Assessments of all installed RBGE display screen equipment have now been carried out.
There are Garden-wide requirements for glare filters, chairs, foot-rests, document-holders and, above all, operator training, which will be the subject of a separate report, but I thought you might like to know the position at the specialist gardens, all of which I have visited recently.
1.
Dawyck.
This workstation passed most assessment criteria, except for the following:— the chair should be capable of height adjustment and should provide adjustable back support; a document holder is needed to reduce possible eye strain; and the work surface did not allow sufficient space at the front of the keyboard.
The recommended minimum depth for tables, desks etc is 800mm.
The printer is noisy and should be fitted with an acoustic hood, or replaced by a quieter machine.
2.
Logan.
The station passed most criteria.
An acoustic hood for the printer is needed (or printer replaced by a quieter type).
Wrist support is needed in front of the keyboard, to reduce the risk of upper limb disorder (ULD).
A document holder is needed, as is an adjustable chair.
3.
Younger.
The existing station passed most criteria, although I am unhappy about the unsecured wiring, which uses extension leads.
The printer is noisy, as per Dawyck and Logan.
A wrist support, document holder and foot-rest are all needed.
Younger has been identified as needing a new, upgraded PC, in addition to the existing station, but under the new legislation, as from 1st January this year, the workstation environment must pass all criteria before new equipment can be installed.
This would involve additional desk space (720mm height, 800mm depth and 1600mm width), and a T-switch to allow for connection of both PCs to the printer.
This additional space must be provided before the new PC can be legally installed, and it is not clear to me where it could be fitted in to the existing room layout without considerable reorganisation of the workspace.
Additionally, my reservations over the wiring would be compounded.
Can I suggest that you and/or your staff discuss the matter with Mr Hall and myself as a matter of urgency, so that the new equipment can be installed as soon as possible?
Existing stations must be brought into line with EC standards by December 1995, but as you know the Computing Sub-Group has recommended to Management that we comply with the legislation as soon as practicable.
Supply of 9 PCs
Two companies were invited to tender for the supply of 8 PCs (later increased to 9) at identical specifications supplied by C Will.
A comparison of the two tenders is given above.
On price grounds, the BS Computers tender is clearly well below that from DCS, and there is no technical difference between the two offerings.
We therefore recommend that the order for 9 PCs as per quotation should be placed with BS Computers.
We also append the quotation from BS Computers for the supply of an Apricot Lan-Station as discussed and agreed at the January 1993 Computing Sub-Group.
Please order as per quotation.
Typists.
I have been asked to send you the following extract from the Minutes of the Computing Sub-Group meeting held 24 March 1993.
3.
Policy on laser printers.
Group agreed that laser printers were uneconomical and unnecessary for normal correspondence, and that their use should be restricted to areas where presentation quality is needed, for preparation of near-camera-ready copy and for documents distributed to outside bodies, such as commissioned Reports, etc.
Staff Bulletin
Microsoft Word — Technical Note
Some staff have had problems with files on floppy disks becoming corrupted.
When this happens, you will be unable to regain access to these files, and you will lose the current version.
The reason this occurs is to do with the way Word handles files.
Each time you <Load> a file,Word makes a new copy of it and places this into your computer's memory.
At the same time, it creates a Temporary File (with a.
TMP extension), which tells the operating system where the original file came from, and where it needs to be put back.
When you <Save> the file, the loaded version is still open, sitting in memory waiting to be closed, with a file pointer in another.
TMP file.
If you take your floppy disk out of the machine while the file is still on the screen,even if you have saved it , it is still open.
Not only will you fill the directory with.
TMP files, but you will also run the risk of incorporating programming code into your documents, which will either insert additional formatting commands or render your document unreadable and unrecoverable.
The only secure way of avoiding this problem is to get into the habit of clearing your screen each time you are finished with a document.
After saving, routinely practice <Transfer><Clear><Window> before you use the <Quit> command.
If you do run into difficulties, there are two possibilities; neither of which is desirable.
1.
If you can get into the document, but you find page numbers increasing alarmingly, you have incorporated page formatting into your document.
Save it as a Text-only document (use the <Tab> key to make this selection).
You will lose all text formatting, but you can always do this again.
2.
If you can't get into the document at all, you will have to rename the previous version (the one with the.
BAK extension) as a document, with the.
DOC extension.
You can do this in Word or in DOS.
To load and rename a backup file within Word , you have to give it its full name with the.
BAK extension when loading.
When you then <Save> this file, the.
DOC extension will be added automatically.
You will have lost your latest changes to the document, but if you have been saving your documents regularly, as you should, this should not be too much of a problem.
