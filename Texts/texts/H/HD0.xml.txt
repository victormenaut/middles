‘Clovenstone Triangle’.
According to the report on the South West Edinburgh Plan the construction of houses at this location has proved to be the single most contentious issue.
It seems unlikely that the objections received will be successfully negotiated and withdrawn and that it will therefore be necessary to hold a Public Local Inquiry into this plan.
It is therefore recommended to authorise that the necessary steps be undertaken.

Chairman ‘s Report
Perhaps the most important events concerning the Village Association over the last year have been related to land, its ownership and usage within the village.
In November, 1990 the 99 year lease on a variety of different properties ended.
The Railway Inn has closed, along with the old chemist ‘s shop.
There has been considerable rumour and conjecture about its future, although recently I have heard once again that it has been purchased but whether to remain as a public house I ‘m not sure.
Despite, I gather some structural problems, the hope of the committee is that the building will remain substantially intact.
The group that has used the old Cooking Centre has had to vacate the premises but so far nothing has happened.
Similarly the tennis court site is subject to a compulsory purchase order from the Liston Foulis Trust at present being pursued by the Edinburgh District Council.
The hope is that the courts will remain and perhaps be upgraded, though this could be a lengthy process.
At present there is a temporary lease.
Late 1990 saw the publication of the South West Edinburgh Local plan for consultation.
This contained one very negative feature for Juniper Green in addition to several positive ones.
I ‘m sure you will all be aware of the projected plan to allow building on the land known as Curriemuirend and the action group that was formed to rally support to oppose this and has effectively done so.
The next step is awaited in this matter.
However, the plan also contained the proposal to make Juniper Green a conservation area which is much welcomed and suggested the compulsory purchase order not only of the tennis courts  but also the Woodhall Paper Mill site which would then be landscaped and integrated into the Water of Leith Walkway.
All of these will have to wait until the possibly amended local plan is approved in total.
All groups of hall users continue with varying fortunes.
The Rifle Club continues to prosper with many successes recorded in many competitions all over Scotland.
The Youth Club has increased in popularity this session and has a thriving expanding membership.
This in itself can bring problems with the numbers of enthusiastic teenagers using the hall.
Sometimes spirits run a little high.
However, Richard Amos, the youth worker, continues to put considerable effort into the work of the youth club and would welcome with open arms any volunteers to join those already helping.
Senior Citizens ‘Club and Lunch Club continue to thrive and provide a much appreciated service ably run by Mrs Wicksted and Miss Finnan respectively.
Bingo is still run on two Mondays per month during the winter.
We have acquired a new bingo machine which helps those doing the calling, which is done on a voluntary basis by committee members.
Functions.
Our own efforts to provide entertainment shows quite a contrast.
All the functions for children were well attended and much in demand.
The Senior Citizens ‘Dinner remains very popular.
The Burns Supper was less so than in previous years but still was an excellent evening arranged by Dr A. Watson.
However, despite a varied programme there has been great difficulty in gathering support for the other functions and indeed the last one had to be cancelled.
Perhaps the new committee should concentrate its efforts on the ends of the age spectrum and ignore the middle.
Appreciation.
The committee is indebted to our local councillors Mrs Beth Brereton and Hugh Fraser for their cheerful unending support and advice throughout the community, to George Lightheart, our community education officer and link with the education department and to Ian Watson the hall caretaker whose efforts frequently go beyond the call of his duties.
Thanks to the committee members for all their help over the last year and particularly to Graham Espin for many years  of enthusiastic effort with the committee, to Ross Hamilton our treasurer for all his hard work, to Mrs Sheila Peterson for her abilities as vice chairman and particularly her talent with the children at our functions, to Miss Netta Gibling who, as ever, provides continuity and expertise as secretary.
Neighbourhood Watch.
We have not been able to arrange a Neighbourhood Watch scheme.
The task has just been too great but perhaps some enthusiastic committed person may take it on, with back up from the Village Association.
Over the years it has been customary for the chairman to be re-elected for a second year.
I regret that for geographical and personal reasons I am not eligible for re-election and shall be leaving the committee altogether.
Also leaving the committee at this time are Mrs Sheila Peterson, Mrs Liz Beevers, Mrs Valerie Hawkins, Mrs Andrea Lawson, Mrs L McEwan, Archie Mack, Graham Espin, Brian Chrystal.
R. Hamilton is resigning as treasurer but is eligible for re-election to the committee.
The following were elected to the committee: Mrs M. Heathwood, Mrs S. Higham, Mrs Morag Perrett, Mrs Ruth Wilson, Dr. A.J. Watson, G. Davidson.
At the conclusion of the business meeting Mrs S. Peterson gave a most interesting slide show of life in the Shetland Islands.
She is to be congratulated on the beauty of the pictures, the wealth of information she imparted on so many aspects and the most comprehensive display of books and articles created by Shetlanders.
Mrs V Hawkins mounted a display of photographs of Juniper Green past and present and hopes that others may add to what she would like to form a permanent record of the village.
The next meeting will be held on Monday, 27th May at 7.30 pm in the Village Hall.

A reply was received from D.M. McBain, the secretary of Baberton Golf Club stating, ‘The litter which contributes to this unsightly area is discarded by residents and not members of the Golf Club.
