Good evening.
Hello.
Hi.
What can I do for you?
Right, Doctor I'm here for a er prescription for  Endoril L A 
Pink?
Pink capsule?
Well I'll tell you  I, I, I was here last month and you know Doctor ?
Mhm.
She said she would put on the computer or something like 
Mhm.
that for three months.
Yeah.
Now I couldn't rem quite remember.
She told me to come back to get my blood pressure checked again.
Right.
And I couldn't remember whether she said at the end of the three months or
End of the month.
just now?
I'm not quite sure  
E every month June.
Basically that's why I'm here.
Mhm.
For the prescription and to get it checked.
Slip your coat off and we'll get 
 
the pressure checked for you.
Ah.
.Slip that round your arm.
That's it.
Right.
That's okay.
There we are.
There.
Just let your arm rest on there.
doing very well.
You're not getting any funny fits from that at all, June?
Er no.
Nothing?
Ah.
That's excellent.
Excellent.
No problem.
It did mention  in the, the sort of packet that maybe  feel cold with cold hands and what have you.
But I think I could live with that.
 
I haven't actually noticed 
 
that there's 
Aye.
Y you'll find
no  
that's really only a problem in the winter time.
Aye.
You will be getting very cold weather
Aha.
during the winter here.
You know a lot of frosty weather.
a coincidence cos at the time I started taking them  actually trying to spare my branch  work in a bank.
Mhm.
So I was trying to spare  and it's really the most coldest branch I've ever been in.
Mhm.
Er the heating had broken down and I don't know whether it was  because of the heating or because of the tablets or whatever but they're, they're alright now.
Yes.
Well I think er th th the time that people notice this most is definitely in the winter.
Aha.
You know if you get maybe a week of fairly hard frost
Aha.
you feel the tips of your fingers   
Yeah.
Cos it'll actually take me till about half past  the day to get any feeling in it, but as I say 
 
I don't know if it was the tablets.
It wasn't, it definitely wasn't the tablets because i if, if it had done that to you, it would have been all day.
Aha.
There'd have been no improvement.
I see.
Aye.
Because it works all the time right 
Aha.
through the twenty four hours.
Right.
So you wouldn't have had any, so it couldn't have been the tablets  doing that to 
 
you .
 
 
If it helps my  blood pressure I could live with the cold 
Yes.
Oh yes.
fingers .
Oh aye.
Oh it's doing really nicely.
And w we'll see you in four weeks again.
That's fine.
And get it checked again June.
Okay.
Okay.
Thanks a lot.
There we go.
Right?
Thank you.
Bye bye.
Okay.
Right.
Bye now.
