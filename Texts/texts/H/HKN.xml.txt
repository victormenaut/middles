Dear Mr Crowdy
Among many old documents purchased recently from a well-known auction house was a property transfer that you might very well like to see.
Re: WILLIAM MORSE CROWDY OF SWINDON 1840
In a clear script on vellum it bears the various stamps and duty impressions required by the law of the day as well as the seal and signature of the above-named person.
Well preserved and attractive, this obviously genuine antique is certain to be of interest to collectors in general.
It is my practice however when coming across manuscripts bearing distinctive old surnames to offer them first to possible direct connections.
Please contact me should you feel sufficiently interested to wish to inspect the original deed and I will make the necessary arrangements — subject to it remaining available.
There will of course be no obligation to purchase, but if you decide to keep it the price will be £27.
Sincerely, A.H.

P.S. This should make an excellent family gift.
