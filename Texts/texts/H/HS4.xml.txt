HOW THEY ARE MADE…
YARNS
For generations Stoddard Templeton have selected only the very finest yarns from all over the world.
The initial stage in any carpet making is the treatment of the pile fibre: first it is blended, washed, dyed, then blended again to combine colours, and finally carded and spun into single yarns.
Woven carpets are made either by the Axminster or the Wilton method.
The materials used are the same but the weaving methods are completely different:
.
WILTON WEAVING is used for plain and patterned carpets.
It is characterised by a tightly controlled method of weaving, where a shuttle passing from side to side of the loom between the warp threads creates loop pile or fine velvet carpeting that has a high density with a very smooth regular surface.
Typical examples are Glendonald and Super Sax 90.
.
AXMINSTER WEAVING produces modern and traditional patterned carpets, where the weaver and designer can incorporate up to eighty colours, ten times more than any other form of weaving.
Looms weave from spools of yarn, one for each line of tufts in the carpet pattern, to produce such carpets as Glenmore, Medici, Caithness, First Edition, Cottage and Studio.
AND WHAT DO THE NAMES MEAN?
There are, of course, other methods of carpet construction:
.
FUSION BONDED carpets employ a process which utilises almost all of the yarn on the carpet surface.
The yarn is adhered, or bonded, to a pre-woven backing, not lost to view as part of the carpet's construction.
This process is unique to Stoddard Templeton in the UK, and produces exceptionally high quality and good value carpets such as Elgin, Oban and Highland Tweed.
.
TUFTED CARPET are made by stitching the yarn through a woven polypropylene backing and either left in loops or cut to give a pile surface.
Carpets produced in this way include Templetwist Elite, Templetwist, Variations Twist, Variations Tweed, Variations Saxony and Croftweave.
.
ICN CARPETS Independently Controlled Needles (ICN), is the most modern method of producing patterned carpets in today's carpet industry.
Up to ten needles can be operated separately by computer programme producing endless designs and colourways at the touch of a button.
Stoddard Templeton launched the first ICN carpet range in the UK called Co-ordinates.
Whatever your carpet requirements, Stoddard Templeton have a wide range of superbly crafted carpets.
REASSURANCE
The British Standards Institution (BSI) has developed a UK National Standard (BS 5750) for manufacturing quality carpets.
Stoddard Templeton is one of the few companies to become a Registered Firm under this scheme.
For a company to earn registration, it must undergo an exhaustive BSI inspection process, which only the very best firms will get through.
These checks are ongoing, ensuring that companies maintain the stringent quality requirements.
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?
The real benefits of all this are felt by you:
All materials used in your carpet are thoroughly checked before manufacture.
The toughest quality checks are then carried out on your finished carpet.
Reliability that is continually monitored by an independent body — the British Standards Institution.
AWARDS
Stoddard Templeton designers work with a wide range of colours, shading from the most delicate of pastels, through subtle neutrals, to the rich and glowing hues of scarlet, blue and gold.
So, if you've dreamed of a certain colour or pattern, you'd be very unlucky not to find it in the Stoddard Templeton range.

POINTS TO WATCH
Here are some essential things to look for in buying the right carpet for you:
RELIABILITY — Check the pile, as it is generally true that the denser the pile, the better the carpet will wear.
MATERIALS — Although wool gives unbeatable softness and luxury, a blend of 80% wool and 20% man-made fibres adds to the wearing resilience of your carpet.
For exceptional durability other man-made fibres are used.
SUITABILITY — Make sure that the carpet you choose is suitable for the area you have in mind.
LABELS — These carry valuable performance data based on laboratory testing and are generally found on the back of the carpet samples.
CONSTRUCTION — Different methods produce alternative results, each with its own benefits.
COLOUR — Lighting can also alter the effect.
It is important to judge colour under the conditions you will have at home.
PLAIN OR PATTERN — Patterned designs show dirt less than a plain colour.
INSTALLATION — It makes sense to have your carpet fitted professionally.

FITTING
Correct fitting of your carpet will ensure that it always looks good.
The preparation of the floor surface is crucial, it should be level and a good underlay will help to minimise any variations as well as improve the look and durability of your carpet.
Additionally, it is wise to lay a felt paper on floor boards before laying your underlay as this will prevent dust from entering the back of the carpet as well as minimising ‘floorboard lines’ appearing through the carpet surface.
It is always advisable to have your carpet laid by a professional who will carry out the job according to the British Standard BS5325.
Your carpet retailer will be able to give you all the details.
KEEPING THEM CLEAN
There are ways to clean a carpet over and above vacuuming.
If the carpet is slightly soiled get an absorbent white cloth, a quality shampoo and warm water.
Use the water sparingly and clean the carpet a small section at a time.
If you need to do the cleaning quickly use an absorbent powder; it is not as effective as a wet shampoo and you must follow the manufacturer's instructions carefully.
An aerosol foam shampoo is useful for cleaning small areas.
Follow the instructions on the can.
NOTE: Before you start shampooing, check that the carpet is well secure around the perimeter.
If you are at all unsure, call in a professional carpet cleaner.
The best way is to use a reputable cleaning company.
All carpets require professional cleaning occasionally.
CARING FOR YOUR INVESTMENT
A good quality carpet should last for a very long time.
Buying less than the best is a false economy.
You can keep your carpet in good condition and looking beautiful by following the simple instructions suggested in this leaflet.
The basic rules are: vacuum your carpet regularly; treat stains immediately and every few months give your carpet a really good clean.
SOME SIMPLE FACTS
Avoid rigorous vacuuming and shampooing during the first few weeks after your new carpet has been fitted.
Remember grit and dirt are a carpet's worst enemies.
Vacuum thoroughly about twice a week and lightly as necessary when the children have been at play.
Stains should be dealt with immediately.
Following the simple instructions in this leaflet should solve the problem.
But, if you use cleaning products, you must follow the manufacturer's directions explicitly.
Remember you are dealing with a valuable investment.
Don't take risks.
If the stain persists, ask a professional carpet cleaner to do the work for you.

A Night You Can Recognise and Trust 
REMOVING STAINS
Using the chart opposite, will show you how to treat various stains.
You should keep this chart with your cleaning equipment to help cope with an emergency.
SOME GENERAL POINTS
Act quickly.
The sooner you tackle the stain, the more chance you will have of removing it.
If you can't remove the stain yourself, at least you will possibly be making it easier for the professionals to get it out later.
Blot up liquids.
Take a clean absorbent white cloth or lots of tissues and take plenty of time to make sure you have removed all the liquid.
Solids.
Get them off the carpet using a blunt knife or spoon.
Always work from the outside.
Move towards the centre to prevent the stain spreading.
Never Rub.
Dab at the stain.
Rigorous rubbing could damage the carpet.
Remember.
Follow the manufacturer's instructions whenever you use a special cleaning product.
It's your investment — take precautions.
