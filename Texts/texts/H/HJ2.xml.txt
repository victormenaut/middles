There is growing concern within the Youth Work Service that the changing needs of young people in Northern Ireland are not being met by the variety of statutory and voluntary bodies involved in youth work provision.
This research project is concerned to determine the level of participation of young people in formal and informal, statutory and voluntary youth provision by age, sex, and religion and to investigate how young people see that service; and to examine the alternatives open to them.
The research involves a close study of two working class communities in Belfast (Catholic and Protestant) using a participatory research approach which involves young people and youth workers in the process of investigation.
It is hoped that, in this way, it will be possible to gain some perception of how young people view the youth service.

The research has examined the effectiveness and impact of financial assistance to firms provided by various public sector agencies.
It has involved the collation of detailed information on assistance paid to firms, together with surveys of managers and employees at assisted businesses.
The main contractor for this study is the Department of the Environment.
It has, however, also been incorporated as one of the City case studies within the ESRC Inner Cities Research Programme.
ESRC has funded some of the survey work and is now supporting the production of a book based on the project to be included in the series on the Inner Cities Programme.
The research has sought to gather comprehensive information on financial support to firms in the study area over the period 1974-84.
Information on payments of assistance to 2,457 individual establishments was collected and analysed.
The majority of this expenditure was accounted for by the Department of Trade and Industry's regional policy measures, which have concentrated aid on supporting investment in traditional, capital-intensive manufacturing industry.
By contrast, the local authorities have mainly helped small businesses in more labour-intensive industries.
Surveys of managers at assisted firms indicated that most assisted projects had significant beneficial impacts on output, productivity and profitability and over half led to increases in employment.
Detailed analyses of cost-effectiveness revealed that the ‘cost per job’ was relatively high for automatic capital grants (Regional Development Grant) and significantly lower in projects supported by DTI Selective Financial Assistance and local authority loans and grants.
The research focused specifically on the labour market impact of assistance policies, based on a complementary survey of employees at assisted firms which was funded by ESRC.
This showed that about two-thirds of jobs generated at inner city establishments were filled by commuters from other parts of the conurbation.
Hence, the policy of simply directing local authority financial aid, funded from the DOE's Urban Programme, to inner city firms may not be the most effective way of providing jobs for disadvantaged inner city residents.
The research points to the need for better targetting of assistance to achieve urban policy goals; to the need for greater selectivity to reduce ‘deadweight’ spending and secure specific sectoral objectives; and suggests the need for a strategic approach to co-ordinate the efforts of the various assistance agencies.
This project was part of the Inner city in Context programme (award reference D/03/25/0001)

The research aims to examine the social and economic causes and consequences of sex-selective migration in one of the poorest and least-studied areas in Latin America — the province of Guanacastle, in north west Costa Rica.
Over the last thirty years large-scale investment in cattle production in the province has led to increased concentration of land and major losses in agricultural employment, both of which have prompted widespread out-migration of the rural poor.
While little detailed work has been undertaken to date on the nature of these population movements, preliminary research carried out by the investigator in Costa Rica in 1987 with support from the Nuffield Foundation suggests that migration patterns have been strongly differentiated along lines of gender: whereas men have tended to migrate out of Guanacastle, at least on a temporary basis, many women appear to have moved permanently to towns within the region itself.
Using a combination of research methods, including analysis of statistical source material and planning documents, a questionaire survey of low-income households in the four major towns of the province (Liberia, Nicoya, Canas and Santa Cruz), and in depth semi-structured interviews with a sub-sample of respondents, the investigation intends to discover why certain groups and/or individuals have moved locally, to examine the implications of female-dominated migration for the evolution of labour markets in Guanacastle's growing towns, and to evaluate the impact of the above on the household structures and survival strategies of the urban poor.

The Indian raw silk industry gives employment to over five million people, mainly farmers, artisans and small-scale entrepreneurs.
They produce the raw material for an extensive weaving industry, the fabrics from which are sold largely in India itself but also increasingly exported.
It is something of a paradox that his industry producing luxury fabrics mainly for middle and upper class consumption is of peculiar benefit to the rural poor.
The proportion of the final value of silk goods returned to producers is substantial, sufficient indeed to have led to a major expansion of the industry in recent years, with visibly greater prosperity in sericultureal areas.
Reeling is the process of converting cocoons into silk year.
It is the stage in silk production for which socio-economic research is currently most urgent and most likely to make practical contributions to future development.
Skilled artisans are employed by private entrepreneurs in units mainly of cottage-proportions, widely spread in villages and small towns.
As types of enterprise, neither these nor their implications for the labour employed in them are well understood.
They appear currently to have considerable social advantages.
Businesses can be started even by those with little capital, and widespread employment is generated for the poor.
But pursuit of a higher quality product induces pressures towards technical and organizational change.
The problem is how this is best to be managed without jeopardizing current advantages.
This research builds on a study of development in sericulture carried out in South India, originally with the support of the SSRC in 1975, but up-dated in 1988.
It will be based on first-hand field studies of selected reeling locations, individual enterprises, the labour involved D largely women and children D and of development initiatives.

Assumptions that internationally based non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and agencies are best equipped to provide humanitarian assistance for refugees are now being increasingly questioned.
Many African countries favour widening and strengthening the role of indigenously based NGOs.
This exploratory study examines the provision of assistance and developmental support by these NGOs in Malawi and Zimbabwe for the large number of refugees from Mozambique.
The feasibility study will:
(i)
provide an overview of the refugee situation in each country;
(ii)
establish the field conditions and appropriate research methods for a full research programme;
(iii)
formalise a network of host-country academics to collaborate in the research.
The full research will appraise the preconditions for and effectiveness of local NGOs in providing assistance for refugees and their hosts.
It will establish a taxonomy of the agencies and assess the linkages between them and governments.
It will examine the implications for self reliant development.
The study will have practical and theoretical relevance.
The results will provide governments and agencies, in the region and elsewhere, with material to enhance the operational provisions of assistance and development programmes for refugees.
A regionally based research and consultancy network will be consolidated.
More generally, theoretical conclusions on the dynamics of agencies and governments in crisis situations, will be considered.

In recent years, increasing attention has been given to the social costs of economic recession and adjustment measures in developing countries.
Governments and international agencies have sought to alleviate the worst effects of economic shocks.
In developing countries, surveys of households are the main source of information about trends in employment and unemployment.
However, they are of limited use for policy purposes.
They provide little information on how labour markets are working or how individuals and households respond to job loss.
Without such information, effective policy measures cannot be developed.
Survey research is expensive.
Rather than advocating new surveys, the research aims to improve the quality and range of information obtained using existing surveys and survey methods.
It examines the results of existing household surveys in Brazil and attempts to make more effective use of the data they generate.
It also develops and pilots a modified questionnaire designed to produce better information on the impact of job loss on workers in urban areas and how different types of people and households respond to the loss of income and employment.

There is much controversy about the effects of trade between developed and developing countries on employment and wages.
However, recent research by the same investigator suggests a rather large adverse effect on the demand for unskilled labour in developed countries.
The present research has three objectives.
(1)
Examining the causes and consequences of past trends.
For example, what precipitated the movement of labour-intensive manufacturing from North to South over the past three decades, and how exactly has this affected the employment and wages of skilled and unskilled workers?
(2)
Protecting possible future trends.
For example, will North-South trade continue to reduce the demand for unskilled labour in developed countries, or will skilled workers also increasingly be affected?
(3)
Assessing the implications for policy in developed and developing countries.
For example, are further increases in protectionism inevitable, or could developed countries instead solve the internal problems caused by North-South trade through tax, training and redistributive measures?

It is the principal supplier of investment goods and armaments and an increasingly important producer of consumer and export goods.
It has enjoyed high priority in resource allocation since the late 1920s.
In recent years, problems have accumulated, and the technological level of many of its products has lagged behind Western equivalents and machinery imports have greatly expanded.

The results of much research carried out within African universities and research centres remain unknown outside the continent, and little known within it.
They are embodied in unpublished theses, research reports of limited circulation or in monographs and journals which are not widely distributed.
Much of the research thus goes unrecorded in the standard bibliographies and data-bases.
This project will review these bibliographies and data-bases to assess their efficiency in recording such material.
The immediate product of the study will be a state-of-the-art essay describing existing bibliographic sources and data-bases; this should prove to be a valuable research tool both within Africa and in the rest of the world.
The second objective is to set an agenda for discussions (in a seminar or workshop) which will facilitate collaboration between existing bibliographic agencies and to suggest new means for the collection of data on African scholarship so that it might be more widely known.

The rural areas of developed countries are experiencing a period of rapid restructuring in their economies and societies.
In some instances, the pace of long-term change is being intensified, for instance in the provision of housing for the rural population, while in others relatively new features are evident, for example in farm indebtedness.
While the processes involved are international in scope, the outcome for different countries and regions can be very different.
This international seminar brings together rural geographers from Britain, Canada and the United States to compare their research methods and findings on the theme of ‘rural restructuring’, with a view to establishing international collaboration in future comparative research.
The seminar will cover six topics within the themes of rural economy and society: rural land use, farm business structure, natural resource management, countryside recreation, rural society and rural employment.
Participants will focus on each topic in turn through the presentation of academic papers, discussions and field-work investigations at sites within the United Kingdom.
The conference begins at University College London, and then progresses to the Universities of Leicester and Birmingham.
It is expected that a book will be published based on the proceedings of the seminar.

Since the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, its provinces and their leaders have come to play an increasing and important role in national politics.
Provincial leaders participate in central decision-making, have a crucial responsibility in the implementation of policy, and are the national leaders of future generations.
This project, which first started in 1982, is one of both compilation and analysis.
Data have been compiled on computer about the career and demographic backgrounds of all those who have held positions of leadership in the hierarchies of the Chinese communist Party, the state administration, and the People's Liberation Army at provincial and regional levels.
The information (about approximately 5,000 individuals) has been stored in one computer file which has been developed for ease of access.
The data have been analysed to clarify three aspects of Chinese politics: the relationship between changes in policies and changes in personnel; the career patterns of provincial laeders; and the political ranking of provinces within China.

This project explores the extent to which Soviet industrial affairs can be understood in terms of social adaptation to certain constraints which are inherent in industrial production.
The main hypothesis is that the social adaptation results in an informal regulation of work-performance to meet the requirement that ‘actual’ effort expended by workers of equal status should be rewarded equally.
The research also aims to find out whether these practices vary with types of industry.
The project concentrates on a period during which the rapidly acquired industrial stock was to be put into efficient use by inexperienced labour and management.
The period also witnessed a particularly determined use of political methods in industrial affairs, thus making available for investigation the ability of the emerging shop-floor ‘custom and practice’ to absorb, routinise and limit the effects of outside interventions.
The main part of the investigation consists in a survey of Soviet archival and published sources, especially periodicals intended for industrial organisers.
A subsidiary aim of the project is to make available for discussion the methodology of making sociological inferences from such texts.

For the understanding of social and economic developments in the USSR, it is vital to be able to assess the reliability of official Soviet statistics.
Western research on this subject over the past 30 years has identified a number of gaps and weaknesses in Soviet official socio-economic data, as well as many statistical series which, it is believed, can be used (sometimes with adjustments for comparability with Western figures).
Our knowledge, however, of the methods by which many Soviet statistical series are produced is limited.
In particular, the ‘state of the art’ in the collection and processing of raw data by the Soviet Central Statistical Administration is something about which rather little is known.
The project is intended to remedy this deficiency by examining the use made of mathematical statistics, and particularly of their application in sampling, in the production of Soviet official socio-economic data.
It is known that sampling is used very little, and when it is used, is often used incorrectly.
Both the reasons for and the consequences of this fact are the subject of the project.
A major source will be the abundant Soviet technical literature on statistical practice, which has been little studied in the West.
Another important source will be interviews with Soviet emigres with experience of work related to the production of official Soviet statistics.

Between 1970 and 1984, Latin America's foreign debt mushroomed from $21 billion to $360 billion, the bulk of it owed to Western banks.
From 1982 onwards, the financial world has faced the possibilities of default, with potentially serious consequences for the entire Western financial system.
Since then, the debt crisis has been handled through a series of temporary rescheduling agreements financed partly by the IMF and partly by private banks, each guaranteed creditworthy by the country's acceptance of an IMF adjustment programme designed to generate a foreign exchange surplus through cuts in imports and export production.
The costs have been high, particularly for the poor: drastic reductions in income and in investment, rising unemployment and inflation on a scale comparable to the earlier impact of the Great Depression.
This project focuses on three countries: Brazil (with the largest foreign debt in the world, over $100 billion), Argentina ($48 billion) and Peru ($14 billion)— concentrating on the political and social consequences of repayment, and the influence these in turn exert on debt renegotiation, as well as the medium-term impact of the crisis on development strategies.
As well as a detailed examination of national and foreign published material, the project will gather new information through a series of in-depth interviews with Government policy makers concerned with debt renegotiation strategies and their broader political and social consequences, the chief business organisations in each country, politicians, policy-makers, Church representatives, trade union and community leaders — paying particular attention to the inter-relationship of economic and socio-political issues.

The project is investigating changes over the last decade in Cheltenham's economic, social and political structure resulting from broad national and international trends.
Cheltenham, part of the relatively affluent Southern ‘sunbelt’ of the UK is especially interesting because of its semi-rural setting and its traditional (yet clearly fading) image as a retirement community for the ex-colonial class.
Prime focus constitutes the lives of selected individuals employed by the area's major industries, namely, aerospace engineering, insurance, communications and education, plus key informants in civic and social institutions.
The particular purpose is to assess the effects of private and State employment strategies upon the town's population and culture.
Dramatic shifts in political support (from Conservative and Labour to Alliance) and in housing markets have accompanied incoming waves of professional and white-collar workers.
This has influenced Cheltenham's physical environment and social patterns.
Area planning policies (eg the green belt) are exerting an impact over the precise location of hi-technology manufacturing.
Again, recent government decisions regarding GCHQ staff have led to management-union tensions, which raise questions concerning local political and social attitudes.
The research examines such relationships between Cheltenham's local characteristics and the more pervasive contemporary changes.
This project is part of the Committee Research Programme on the Changing Urban and Regional System in the UK (award reference D042)

The project seeks to understand the effects of colonialism and neo-colonialism by studying the history of the highland region of Charcas (modern Bolivia) from before the period of Inca domination to the present day.
It will look both at large-scale historical transformations, and at the responses and perceptions of the local Andean population, since the present crisis affecting highland Bolivia cannot be understood without taking into account its historical and cultural roots.
While the publications arising from the project will discuss only this particular region, the results should be of more general relevance for analysing the crisis of many regions on the periphery of the world economy today.
Two books will be produced: a documentary anthology on the early history of Charcas, and a general interpretative essay on the region up to 1952.

In the 1970s, the structure of British households was changed considerably with, for example, increases in the proportions of one-person households and declines in the proportion with children.
Such changes have implications for the demand for housing, both in terms of numbers and types of dwellings.
Conversely, the availability of different types of housing also affects the ability of persons and families forming separate households.
The research is concerned with household formation and dissolution by use of the OPCS 1% Longitudinal Study, which links the records of 1/2 million persons in the 1981 and 1971 Censuses.
Thus change in household and housing circumstances of people over the 1970s will be analysed by their characteristics at the earlier census to establish which factors are important in this process.
Since housing tenure has been found to be particularly strongly associated with wider social and demographic factors, the role of tenure will receive particular attention.
The data will be used to construct a statistical model of the process of household change which will allow the sensitivity of household formation to a range of socio-economic and demographic factors to be assessed.

The research is concerned with the changes that have taken place in the engineering profession since the Finniston Report and particularly after the appointment of the new Engineering Council.
It is focusing on the changes that have taken place both in the relationship between the profession and the government and in the internal organisation and politics of the professional institutions.
A major question posed is the extent to which the professional bodies, including the Engineering Council and the institutions, can be said to be performing a mediating role between the members of the profession and the government; that is representing the memberships' interests while also entering into agreements with the government which are likely to limit their members' freedom of action.
Accordingly, the research is examining not only the role of the Engineering Council and professional institutions, but also the relationships among these bodies, the problems of leadership within them, the motivation of the leadership and the role of other organisations within the engineering field.

The 1960's were a period of racial turmoil in the United States.
Since then, blacks have become much less prominent in posing a militant challenge to American society.
The question arises as to whether this is the result of their having fallen into apathy out of fear of repression and a belief that it is not possible to make progress; or whether it is precisely because they have been making progress through existing channels that the militant challenge has withered.
Whether blacks are indeed being incorporated into American society is seen as a major test of its capacity to live up to its liberal and democratic ideals.
The research attempts to assess the nature and extent of black progress in recent years in light of these issues.
The adequacy of the liberal and radical approaches to the problem are analysed.
The research then focuses specifically on the role of politics in changing the position of blacks.
Specifically, the impact of recent advances by blacks in local government is assessed.
The principal method of investigation is a series of case studies involving extended interviews with significant political figures, supplemented by analysis of statistical and documentary data.

Focusing on the period 1950 to 1983, this project explores the dynamics of the voting act in British parliamentary elections by means of aggregate data analysis.
Studies of this type usually focus on general elections alone, but this one looks also at by-elections and at the change between them.
The project's basic aim is to throw some light on the short-term forces making for change first on patterns of voting turnout and secondly on patterns of party choice, especially the vote for the governing party.
The short-term forces in question emanate from the political parties contesting the election and can be divided into three categories: the political context of the election, the candidates in the constituency and the standing in public opinion of the national parties and their leaders.
Controlling on such long-term forces as the strength of partisanship in the electorate and regional differences in turnout and voting patterns, the influence of these categories of forces is examined for each type of parliamentary election separately and for the change between them.

This study is a preliminary piece of work concerned with a possible initiative from the Social Affairs Committee on the Future of Welfare.
Its focus is the relevance of political and social ideas to public choices in the welfare state and social policy more generally.
It reviews research that has already been conducted in this area and offers suggestions as to what may be priorities for future support.
Its principal recommendation is that there is urgent need for research on the ideas that form what many people take to be the consensus of attitudes that underlie the post-war development of the welfare state.
In particular there is greater need to understand the limited scope of that consensus to see how current controversies are based in earlier ones.
The study also suggests that priority ought to be given to research which synthesises available evidence and arguments about key aspects of welfare policy, including the unit of assessment for the purposes of tax and social security, personal freedom and preventive health measures and the social responsibility for dependants.

In the field of British official publications, the Ford list of British parliamentary papers, and earlier volumes in the series, have aimed to provide those studying changes in public policy with a guide to the relevant HMSO publications.
However, the fact that HMSO now publishes only about 20% of official publications has seriously undermined the usefulness of the Ford list.
This project investigates the sources, availability and importance of non-HMSO official publications in the hope that it will prove feasible to extend the scope and usefulness of future Ford lists.
The existing lists of public bodies are being cross-checked in order to provide a definitive list of these for the year 1983.
Existing catalogues of non-HMSO official publications are being examined for their degrees of comprehensiveness.
Finally, these catalogues are being checked from the point of view of identifying items relating to public policy changes and the availability of the full text of these items is being tested.

This project investigates the specific question of the relationship of management in government with the House of Commons.
To that end, interviews are being held with Members of Parliament, and to a lesser extent with the Clerks of the House of Commons, civil servants, officials of the political parties, and other interested third parties.
Members of Parliament are being asked about such matters as their degree of satisfaction with the quantity and quality of financial information available to them and the extent to which they feel that MPs can and should be closely involved in scrutinising the management of government, together with their ‘unstructured’ personal response to the problem of the control of the public administration by the House of Commons.
A particular effort has been made to solicit the views of MPs with a special interest in the topic, such as Members of the Public Accounts Committee, but it has been felt equally important to gain the views of non-specialist MPs, and to achieve a balance between the parties and regions, and between town and country.

This research summarises recent literature on evaluation which is relevant to ‘community’ or ‘voluntary’services and projects and describes the relationship between the Urban Programme and these sectors.
The evaluation framework emphasises the importance of understanding the process of policy formulation and implementation.
For example, part of the evaluation is to monitor the ways in which these sectors have the opportunity to determine policy and the allocation of resources within the Urban Programme machinery.
The interest in policy outcomes is influenced by a model of pluralistic evaluation which identifies the major constituent groups of a policy initiative, each of whom attaches a different notion of criteria for success to an operation, plus different strategies for pursuing objectives.
Questions of dependency, accountability, voluntarism, innovation, participation and democratisation are raised.

The research will seek to answer the question, ‘Why are certain goods within a society identified as luxuries, and what purposes, if any, are served by such identifications?’
The answer will be sought through a mutually sustaining mixture of conceptual analysis and historical/sociological investigation.
The point of departure is the intuition that the presence of a notion of luxury within a society enables it to judge what, by contrast, is socially necessary and, in this sense, the notion is an integral part of a society's self a definition.
The pursuit of this line of enquiry will encompass a discussion of the complex and historically fluid relationship between needs and wants, including the ways in which they ground moral claims.
Although this is a fluid relationship, so that the definition of a particular good as a luxury is obviously relative, the persistent identification of goods within the categories of need/luxury suggests that these categories are constants.
This constancy indicates as a preliminary hypothesis that the meaning of luxury is deeply political: it manifests a concern on the part of society — or its authorities — to uphold a particular conception of public order.

The number of ‘hung councils’— i.e. local authorities which are party politicised, but in which no one party has overall control of the council — has increased steadily in recent years.
There are now over 100 such authorities in Britain.
The research aims to identify the principal ways in which the onset of hungness changes political and management processes within such authorities.
A number of hypotheses drawn from the previous work of the investigators will be used to structure the analysis.
For example it is hypothesised that disagreement over the budget is the most likely single cause of the breakdown of co-operative arrangements; and that the operation of explicit ‘codes of practice’ governing inter-p[arty relationships is likely to reduce the tension and uncertainty inherent in hungness.
The research will use two survey methods; a questionnaire distributed to chief executives of all hung authorities; and interviews in a sample of twenty such authorities with key members and officers.
It is hoped that the results of the research can be developed into ‘good practice’ guidance for newly-hung councils, or councils which have not yet satisfactorily adjusted to their hung situation.

In 1985 Dr G. Alderman (now Prof Alderman) commenced research into the impact of London Jewry upon the work of the London County Council, 1889-1940; this investigation was financed principally by the Leverhulme Trust, the British Academy and the Wolfson Foundation.
The present ESRC-funded project will enable full coverage of the period 1940-86 to be undertaken, embracing the last quarter-century of the LCC and the 21 years of the greater London Council.
This period witnessed the gradual disengagement of London Jewry from the activities of the LCC, as Jews moved politically away from Labour politics and geographically beyond the LCC boundary.
The creation of the GLC created new problems for the community; the final years of Labour dominance of the GLC (1981-86) were marked by an unprecedented hostility between the Jews of London and County Hall.
Two major aims of the research will be to trace the rise of Conservatism in the Jewish communities of suburban London before the creation of the GLC, and to investigate the causes of the rift between the community and the Labour Party in London in the 1970s and 1980s.

Black politicians receive considerable attention in the press and television.
For example, there has been extensive coverage of the controversial actions of a few local councils in London, and of the campaign for black sections in the Labour party.
The selection of 27 black candidates by the major parties as parliamentary candidates, and the likely election of some black members of parliament at the forthcoming general election have also heightened interest in the rise of black politicians in British politics.
Yet it has been argued that the British political system is ill-designed to allow the articulation of the interests of unpopular, minority groups.
This project will examine the various avenues of political representation available to the ethnic minority communities and the likely success of alternative strategies.
Particular attention will be given to the campaign for black sections in the Labour party and to non-parliamentary forms of political action.

Research summary: Soviet economic aid to the less developed countries — a statistical database.
The outlines of the methodology explained the omission of certain LDCs (China and the East European CMEA countries).
The main source for agreements was shown to be the Soviet official International Treaty series backed up by other evidence, and the figures for disbursement were compiled largely from evidence extracted from the BBC's Summary of World Broadcasts, from documents made available to the researcher at the Friedrich Ebertstiftung Institut in Bonn and at OECD in Paris and, in a few cases, by personal visits and observation.
These figures were converted into current and constant prices expressed in US dollar terms as a basis for comparison with Western aid and in order to give a more accurate picture of fluctuations.

Research summary: The main research involved: a) Work on original documents in the United Nations Information Centre, London, the Dag Hammerskjold Library and the Central Research Library, New York and the Library of Congress in Washington.
This involved mainly work on UN documents relating to UN peace-keeping activities; debates in the General Assembly and the Security Council; meetings and reports of the Human Rights Commission and the Sub-Commission on the Prevention of Discrimination and the protection of minorities; and the work of specialised agencies such as UNESCO and the UNDP.
Some reference was also made to congressional documents.
b) Interviews with people actively involved in a practical way in ethnic conflict and minority protection.
(A full list of people consulted in the US is included at the end of the report.)
A small number of academics with a special interest in the appropriate issues were also consulted.
c) Work on secondary material in the following areas: conflict theory; theories of ethnic relations; minority protection and human rights; certain case studies (Lebanon, Sri Lanka, Palestine, Cyprus).
This research was undertaken at the British Library of Economic and Political Science, School of Oriental and African Studies, Library of the Conflict Research Society at City University, London; Central Research Library, New York; Columbia University; and the Library of Congress.
Reference was also made to the Woodrow Wilson collection of materials relating to the League of Nations in the Dag Jammerskjold Library.
Attention was given to materials not easily obtainable in Northern Ireland — pamphlets, monographs, unpublished theses etc.
The Library of Congress has a computerised keyword index to books and recent periodical articles and this was an enormous help in locating materials that otherwise might have been overlooked.

From 1973-82 the United Nations convened the largest multilateral conference on the law of the sea.
The resulting convention, the United Nations convention on the law of the sea (UNCLOS) was opened for signature in December 1982.
One hundred and fifty nine states have signed UNCLOS, several significant western states have not, although, to date a little over half of the required ratifications have been deposited.
The convention requires ratifications by sixty states for it to enter into force.
It is, nonetheless, already apparent that certain provisions of the convention are already influencing state practice.
What is also becoming clear, nevertheless, is that there is considerable diver- gence, in some instances of a quite marked kind, In state practice.
While some states are enacting certain parts of the convention verbatim, others are interpreting it and adapting it to suit particular national interests and policies.
The main purpose of the research project is to illustrate and examine the extent to which national laws either converge or diverge on selected major issues covered by the law of the sea convention.
These include base lines for the territorial sea; navigation rights; zonal rights and jurisdiction in, for example, the 200 mile Exclusive Economic Zone, and, over the continental shelf; scientific research and the preservation of the marine environment.
The research will be conducted on the basis of data collated on national laws and practice, interviews and field visits to for example the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation, the International Oceanographic Commission and United Nations in New York, and the maritime centres of universities overseas.
The project will therefore be considerable practical value to the wide variety of individuals and groups — scholars, teachers, practitioners, government officials and policymakers, as well as other groups with interests in particular aspects of the law of the sea, including those engaged in marine scientific research, shipping and trade.

The award will enable the Bentham Project at University College London to edit in four volumes Bentham's later writings on constitutional government and codification as part of the Collected Works of Jeremy Bentham.
The works (Leading principles of a Constitutional Code; Official Aptitude Maximized, Expense Minimized; Codification proposal; and Emancipation Spanish) were mostly written in the 1820's when Bentham brought together, with his theory of representative democracy, his long interest in public finance and codification, which were then adapted in Bentham's words ‘for the use of all nations and all governments professing liberal opinions’.
The volumes will be mainly based on previously unpublished manuscripts which will be edited, with full annotation, name and subject indices, and editorial introductions, to the high standard of the Collected Works and published by Oxford University press.

The challenge facing democratic theory today is daunting.
For the key traditions of political theory, above all those of liberalism, pluralism and Marxism, appear to be exhausted in the face of major twentieth century developments.
Among the latter are to be counted the dynamics of a world economy which produce instabilities and difficulties within states and between states which outreach the control of any single ‘centre’; the rapid growth of transnational links which have stimulated new forms of collective decision-making involving states, intergovernmental organisations and an array of international pressure groups; the build-up of military arms and the general means of warfare as a ‘stable feature’ of the contemporary political world.
Such phenomena raise fundamental questions about the nature of democracy today.
The aims of the proposed research project are, first, to test the adequacy of democratic theory in relation to trends toward ‘globalisation’— the growth of complex interconnections and interrelations between states and societies — and, second, to develop a new framework for democratic thought which can perhaps more satisfactorily articulate the relation between national and international conditions and processes.
The research project will embody a number of stages and elements including:
(a)
the clarification of the concept of democracy in light of the global economy and system of nation-states;
(b)
an assessment of relevant theories and evidence about the impact of the international order on democratic life;
(c)
the elaboration of a provisional synthesis of materials which highlight the constraints facing democracies in the global system;
(d)
the specification of the problem areas for future research.
Throughout it will be my intention to provide a detailed map and theoretical analysis of the external challenges to democracy in order to lay basis for re-thinking the meaning of democracy in the face of global developments

Decisions about how much to spend on public goods and services are at the heart of modern government.
Yet very little is known in any detail about how these important decisions are made.
What influence does the treasury really have in the preparation of spending plans?
How does it negotiate with departments in Whitehall?
These are the sorts of questions tackled in the research.
The investigators also seek to explain why it is that whatever the complexion and resolve of the government of the date, public spending has apparently irresistible momentum.
There are three strands to the research.
First, we aim to set out what has happened to the total level of spending in the last 12 years.
Second, what has been the impact on the Civil Service of the new climate created by the attempt at tighter spending control?
Have civil servants and their Ministers accepted the new regime of cash limits, financial management and spending squeezes?
And third, how has the central system for planning and controlling spending in Whitehall changed as a consequence of the ‘hard times’?
Have the innovations introduced since 1976 given the Treasury greater control?
How effective is the system?
What have been effects of the changes on the spending departments and their relationships with the Treasury?
The research will be conducted in three main ways: through the collection and analysis of primary and secondary materials from official publications and from the academic literature; through unstructured interviews with civil servants in the Treasury and selected spending departments; and our working Paper series will be used to test our conclusions on officials, Ministers, ex-Ministers and Academics.

How does a national party system arise from pre-existing allegiances to place of birth and social group?
What is the process by which local loyalties and parochial orientations give way to wider concerns?
These are questions that were not asked during the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Century nation-building experiences in Europe and the United States.
yet without answers to these questions and others like them, it is impossible for us fully to understand our own history and, more importantly, impossible to advise today's emergent nations on the routes they should be following.
In coming years we have a unique opportunity to see mechanisms of social and political development at work.
With the effective abolition of national frontiers within the European Community after 1992, it is evident that European politics will become increasingly central to the
European electorate.
This project seeks to establish a baseline from which evolution of a truly European political system can be tracked over the coming centuries of political development.
In this first study, the European-ness of the 1989 elections will be explored in depth to see whether there are differences between EC countries, and to search for clues about likely future changes.

The post of chief executive was established in almost all British local authorities from 1973, largely with job specifications relating to advice in national reports.
As heads of the paid service and principal policy advisers, with primary responsibility for implementation of the council decisions and effectiveness of their authorities' administration as a whole, chief executives are the key-link between their councils and their staffs.
Their role is therefore a major determinant of the accountability and effectiveness of local democracy as a whole.
It has been interpreted and adapted in widely different ways, relating to varied environments and concepts held by chief executives themselves.
With support from the Royal Institute of Public Administration and the Society of Local Authority Chief EXecutives in planning and execution, the research studies the genesis of the role, its development over time in response in different and changing environments, its present status, problems and fitness to needs, the characteristics of its occupants, and directions in which the local government executive function might most aptly develop to meet postulated future needs of local communities and environmental change.
Methods employed will include historical analysis, postal survey, interviews, international comparison and a workshop directed at assessing future needs.

The 5 year European Research Programme, launched in 1986, has now reached the half-way mark.
It assesses the evaluation of agricultural structures, the impact of structural policies and the extent of multiple job-holding amongst farm families.
It will analyse the consequences of trends in farm structures and farm household pluriactivity for farming, environment, the rural economy and the evolution of rural, agricultural and environmental policies in different types of European rural region.
Four Surveys have been completed.
The data from the Baseline Survey of 300 farm households in each of the 24 Study Areas throughout Western Europe has been deposited with the ESRC Sata Archive.
The first Panel Survey of a selected number of the 300 households in each Study Area has been implemented, providing interesting insights into the changing lifestyles of the people on the land.
Two Context Studies have been prepared on the socio-economic background in the regions involved, the first concentrating on agricultural structures and the second on the development of non-agricultural labour markets in rural areas.
The four months from March to July, 1989, represent a crucial period in the research.
The Baseline Data sets are being processed to create data bases at the farm, family and individual levels; core data are being merged to enable comparative analysis across Europe; derived variables are being constructed, the Statistical aspects are being studies.
The information from the first Panel Survey supplied in the form of grids as well as reports is being analysed to ensure that necessary modifications to the approach or to the methodology will be identified and approved before the second Panel Survey, which is due to start in the autumn.
The information from the Context Studies is being integrated with Baseline and Panel results, so that the effect of the surrounding rural economy on farm structures and farm household pluriactivity can be explored.
In addition, the information from the Surveys dealing specifically with policy measures is subject to separate analysis as a contribution to the policy review under way in the Commission of European Communities.
This includes the analysis of the uptake of different types of policy concerned with structural improvement, environmental measures, farm development, diversification and income support, and of administrative problems encountered with different types of policy measure.

This project rests on the distinction between an alliance and an entente, the former being distinguished by firm and usually detailed military commitments, the latter by weaker and less precise ones, as in the case of the relationship between the United States and Israel.
The project has two aims.
The first is the historical one of advancing the understanding of South Africa's political and military relationship with European colonial powers in the critical period following the accession to power of the National party.
The second aim is the theoretical one of using new evidence on this ‘White Entente’(for such it was) to confront the plausible claim that ententes have the advantages of alliances without their disadvantages.
An alleged disadvantage of alliances is that they lock states to each other even after the circumstances which initially produced them have been fundamentally altered.

In recent years most Latin American countries have moved from military dictatorships to democracy.
These new democracies face a variety of problems in their attempts at consolidation, largely stemming from the heavy levels of external indebtedness, which places serious constraints on their ability to resume economic growth.
Without a resumption of economic growth.
the new democracies of Latin America will come under increasing strain.
The research examines the links between economic growth and the consolidation and extension of democracy in the three largest countries of Latin America: Argentina, Brazil and Mexico.
It.
focuses on the role which unions and employers' associations play in hindering or facilitating government economic policy.
Of particular interest are the conditions under which government, employers and unions are able to formulate and operate a viable incomes and prices policy which lowers the rate of inflation and stimulates renewed economic growth.
The research attempts to identify the social and political conditions which contribute to the success or failure of the consolidation of democracy.
Regular visits to each of the three countries over the five-year period will enable a series of interviews with key decision-makers to be carried out, and qualitative and quantitative data to be collected.

A major assertion of democratic theory is that governments in representative democracies are uniquely sensitive to the preferences of the population.
Practically, this is ensured by the governments being composed of parties which have to compete for votes at elections, on the basis of promises about what they will do if they get back into government next time.
The promises and statements made in election programmes are the basis of all those made in the campaign, so by relating these to government statements of their legislative programme, and even more so to actual behaviour in office, we can see if party-based democracies actually do work in this way.
Some studies of specific election pledges and their fulfilment by governments have already been made.
About seventy per cent seem to be carried out.
What these studies also show however is that parties are careful not to make specific pledges on matters of central importance, such as the economy or unemployment.
What they seem to do instead here is to stress the importance of certain areas, and de-emphasise others, depending on whether they think this will gain them votes or not.
To check whether the relative emphases in the programme get carried over into government priorities, we can count the sentences devoted to each topic and see if these relate over time to spending in various areas.
This provides another test of the ‘mandate theory of party democracy’ which we are carrying out for Britain, USA, Canada, France, West Germany, Austria, Australia and the Netherlands.

This project is directed to collecting and preparing, in a form suitable for deposit with historical archives, about 1,000 documents in various languages.
The documents are of two types: party election manifestos or their equivalents (about 800 of them): and government statements of their programme (the equivalent of the British Queen's speech).
The documents have been collected by an international team of scholars led by Professor Ian Budge, Essex University.
They have been used to ‘track’ party policies over the postwar period and to see how far party's electoral promises have been fulfilled in government.
However, it is clear that the collection is also of considerable general interest for historians and other scholars of the postwar period.
The grant will support the transfer of the documents from individuals to a central collection, transcription of nearly illegible photocopies etc.
When completed it will be lodged with the major European Historical Archives.
The countries covered by the collection are all those of Western Europe (including Northern Ireland but excluding Finland, Iceland, Spain, Portugal, Malta and Greece); and Canada, the USA, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Sri Lanka and Israel.

Political and economic theories about the process of West European integration were developed in the 1950s in the light of the patterns of trade, industrial production, social interchange across borders, and international security which then prevailed.
The institutional context provided by the OEEC and NATO was largely taken for granted; the primary focus for study — and political debate — was on the structures and policies of the evolving European Communities.
In the 30 years since then economic, industrial, technological, social and polit-ical changes have transformed the West European region.
The dynamism of its central economies has drawn peripheral countries in; migration and tourism have created a European social space'; governments, and economic elites, have come to interact intensively both through formal institutions and through informal arrangements.
The shape and boundaries of the region have themselves altered, both in terms of Community membership and the pattern of association around its borders and in terms of flows of people, goods and investment.
The aim of this study is to review the relationship between the formal structures of European institutions and the dynamics of social, economic, and external change, and so to lay the foundations for a renewed theoretical debate about the processes of integration within the West European region.

With the support of the ESRC the investigator has completed a statistical base for the study OI Soviet economic assistance to the less developed countries (LDCs), analysing the method used, giving some historical background and giving some details of all the aid agreements reached and the progress made on their implementation.
It is now intended to draw conclusions from these statistics and other related information on four aspects of Soviet assistance:
(i)
a history of the development of Soviet assistance to the LDCs from its inception on a formal basis in the mid-1950s to its apparent demise after the arrival of Gorbachev in the late l980s
(ii)
the objectives of Soviet assistance — strategic, political and economic, and their relative success
(iii)
has Soviet assistance any relevance to ‘perestroika’ as suggested by some of its academic supporters in the USSR, especially in the role of opening up markets to earn the necessary hard currency?
(iv)
can any meaningful comparison be made between Soviet and Western economic aid, and if so what conclusions can be drawn''

The poll tax, officially called the Community Charge, has been hailed by the Government as a massive step forward in promoting local democracy.
To its opponents, however, the poll tax will reduce civil liberties and widen the gap between rich and poor.
The public is being bombarded with contradictory information about the new tax from all sides.
This research is designed to investigate this flow of information to see how well the public is being informed about such a major piece of legislation.
It will be especially concerned with the role of press and television in this process.
The research comes at a time when serious questions are being asked about the use of advertising and public relations by the government, and when the media, too, are the subject of considerable scrutiny.
If forms part of a continuing programme of research on the part played by the mass media in informing the public about social policy.

Party members and activists play an important role in British politics and yet compared with voters they remain an understudied group.
This research will carry out the first national random sample of Labour Party members.
The Labour Party has cooperated with the researchers in providing its national membership.
The method of investigation is a survey by mail questionnaire of a national sample of approximately 5,000 members.
The research project will produce a profile of the party membership, will measure the range and type of party activism, and will measure attitudinal similarities and differences between party members, activists and voters.

Economic prosperity in the USSR today is threatened by serious shortfalls in the growth of the working population as a result of birth rate declines in the 1960s.
The labour shortage that has resulted is further exacerbated by the traditional labour-intensive methods of Soviet industry and the tendency for enterprise managers to hoard labour.
In the current period of political transition since the death of Brezhnev in 1982, a lively debate is proceeding about the contours of a far-reaching reform of the Soviet economy.
This project will look at one important aspect of economic reform — policy toward the allocation of labour among enterprises.
Since the early 1950s the Soviet workforce has, in the main, found its jobs by methods familiar to workers outside the state socialist economies: advertisements at the factory gate, in newspapers, by word of mouth.
The Soviet worker is free to choose his/her job and change jobs at will according to how they see their individual interests and inclinations.
But this ‘labour market’ has resulted in scarcities for the least desirable jobs and regions (even despite generous wage incentives not enough people want to be coal miners in Siberia).
At the same time natural resource depletion is necessitating rapid development of Siberian energy and raw material sources.
How are the workers to be encouraged to go where their labour is most needed.
Apart from the significance of the labour shortage, the researchers at CREES think that a study of labour policy-making will contribute to our knowledge of how policy is formed in the USSR, how priorities are determined, by whom, and how the various interest groups (the Communist Party, the government bureaucracy, the economic ministries, factory managers and workers themselves) view labour problems and the solutions proposed to alleviate them.
The labour shortage in the USSR has been forecast by demographers now for nearly two decades.
It has been suggested that the Soviet political process produces tendencies for problems to be faced too late and for decision-makers then to push too fast and too far paying little heed to the impact of their decisions in other realms.
This project will help us to confirm or reject this hypothesis.

Radical changes in cable technology have caused a major debate about the future development of European broadcasting.
In Britain this debate has had two main features: an interest in the relevance of American experience of cable television, and complaints about the lack of a clear direction in the responses of the British Government.
The research aims to provide solid evidence about how European governments have responded to cable television and to investigate whether a distinctive European regulatory policy is emerging.
The study highlights the factors which shape the substance of European regulatory policies for cable television (including the size and character of the indigenous cable television industry).
By a European comparison of national policies for ownership, competition, technology, finance, programming and telecommunication, the research provides an alternative basis for considering possible improvements to British regulatory policies.
In particular, the research focuses on the value of cable television to local authorities — eg, as infrastructural investment, as an instrument of ‘community building’.
The principal methods of investigation are a desk study (in part completed during 1983-84) and a series of semi-structured interviews with policy-makers in Britain, France and the Federal Republic of Germany.

The research will describe and analyse the process of modernisation in the Spanish Armed Forces since the death of General Franco in 1975.
This will be done through the elaboration of a theoretical model which will investigate the relationship between military attitudes, organisation and production.
The research hypothesis is that each of these aspects exerts influence upon and is in turn influenced by the other two, and the project is designed to establish the precise nature of the inter-relationship.
Spain's current political leaders see military modernisation as critical to the underpinning of democratic stability, the elaboration of acoherent role for Spain with NATO, and the restructuring of domestic industry towards high technology production.
An analysis of the interaction between the three elements under consideration will facilitate the assessment of the prospects for this policy of military modernisation in Spain.
The research will also help to understand the demosetic constraints of Spanish defence policies, especially in regard to Spain's role within NATO.

The research will investigate the connections between popular political organization at the grass-roots of society and processes of institutional change at national level in the three countries.
Special attention will be paid to the legal and institutional constraints on popular organization and strategic choice, and to the ways in which social and economic demands come to require different forms of popular political representation.
Moreover, comparative analysis will focus on three cases where popular movements have organized within major corporative institutions of the political system, so emphasizing their linkages to national governments, and the struggles and negotiations which change these linkages.
The focus on popular political strategy, on the one hand, and on changes in political representation, on the other, may reveal democratic advance even where there is not the kind of regime change called a ‘transition to democracy’; so that systems undergoing such complete (Spain) or partial (Brazil) transitions may be compared to others (Mexico) where none have taken place.
In addition, the research will seek to elicit new criteria of regime definition to replace the present (over) simple schemes (authoritarian-democratic; inclusionary-exclusionary).
New research will take place in Brazil to complement that already undertaken in Spain and Mexico.

The central purpose of this project is to obtain a better understanding of China's attitude towards, and likely role in international arms control.
It is first necessary to assess China's broader security policy in order to understand what role is played by arms control in defending China.
The ensuing, more detailed research questions concern China's role in the three most crucial specific aspects of arms control:
(1)
Superpower Arms Control: How does China view this arms control and does it perceive a role for third powers?
Does China still refuse to join international agreements on nuclear proliferation or are there signs of a softening of its position?
(2)
Arms Control in Europe: As the ‘other frontier’ for the Soviet Union, Chinese and European security have inevitable links.
Does China appreciate these linkages and is it concerned about the prospects of European arms control for its own security?
What policy does China adopt in the face of such linkages?
(3)
Arms Control in Asia: With the dawning of the Pacific Century, the need for a truly pacific Pacific requires some form of arms control.

As the major source of funds for house purchase and a massive force in the financial system, building societies have increasingly been in the public eye since the early 1970s.
And house price boom and slump, rising mortgage rates and access to home loans have increasingly generated government concern and action.
Most recently, societies' ambitions to expand and diversify their operations have been a key factor behind the major package of new legislation introduced into Parliament in 1986.
This study is looking at relations between the societies and government since the early 1970s, including the key role of the societies' trade body the Building Societies Association.
The focus is on two particular topics, first, the Government/BSA Joint Advisory Committee which tried to regulate mortgage lending and house prices in the 1970s and, second, the new legislation itself.
The work draws on a combination of documentary evidence plus interviews and discussions with a wide range of key actors in the societies, the BSA and government.
One of several case studies under the Council's ‘Corporatism and Accountability’ initiative, the project aims to relate government/building society relations to various ‘models’such as pressure group politics or closer, more formalised ‘corporatist’relations in which non-governmental bodies are drawn into the process of making and implementing policy.

This project investigates the selecting process using a model of ‘supply and demand established that MPs have a fairly similar social background in terms of occupation gender, race and education.
Despite gradual change, parliament continues to include non-white and working class members.
Why is this?
Some argue it due to the supply of applicants who wish to stand for this view there are certain practical, life-style and attitudinal constraints which seeks a full-time political career.
Yet others argue that demand is the key, as select implicit or explicit discrimination by party activists.
The aim of this research is to re-examine this question using large-scale surveys of and the ‘pool of applicants’ in the 1992 general election.
The projects breaks n devloping an interactive model which analyses both sides of the selection process.

The initial results are summarised in a series of chapters and conference papers available authors, and a book Representation in Britain: Class, Race and Gender in the British will be forthcoming in 1994.

When a local planning authority makes proposals for the future use of land in an area, through the publication of a local plan, it is often an occasion for great local controversy.
For such a plan not only allocates land for development but, as a consequence, distributes financial or environment costs and benefits.
For instance, landowners who find their land scheduled for housebuilding may enjoy an immediate increase in capital value.
Householders however, who look out over the proposed site may fear the loss of a pleasant environment and a drop in their property value.
As a result, controversial local plans tend to attract numerous objections which are then tested at a local inquiry.
While one might expect eventual decisions to be made purely on the merits of the case, earlier evidence indicates that some objections are more likely to succeed in influencing decision-makers than others.
In particular, through an examination of 5.000 objections to 25 local plans, this research will seek to discover whether good professional representation and actual appearance at an inquiry improves an objector's chances of success.
Attention will also be given to whether pro-development objections are more likely to succeed than anti-development ones.

In the last decade the policy agenda concerning the Arctic has gradually been expanded, with a growing interest in scientific study and environmental protection supplementing the study of the area's existing defence significance and economic value.
As a new appreciation of the Arctic's importance has evolved, the littoral states have tended either to exclude non-Arctic states from activities in the area, or to offer them less-favoured treatment.
This more exclusivist approach can be seen in some of the proposals embodied in Mr Gorbachev's Murmansk Initiative most of which was directed to the Nordic and other Arctic states.
This ESRC-financed research project will outline aspects of United Kingdom policy with application in the Arctic and will examine the policy consequences for the UK of possible exclusion from certain areas of Arctic activity and suggest appropriate responses.
Particular attention will be paid to defence; commercial activities, notably with regard to energy resources; environmental protection; and scientific research.
The method of investigation involves a study of specialist literature; interviews with key people in the relevant UK ministries; and review, by a study group of experts, of the project's output.

The aims of the project are to determine and to describe Western Europe's current and potential capabilities for the military use of space, and the extent to which options are being addressed by European governments and intergovernmental institutions.
The study has four main objectives: To identify those elements of the national space programmes of the European members of NATO which could contribute to a multilateral military space programme.
To examine the practical advantages which might flow from such collaboration.
To establish the degree to which bilateral or multilateral space cooperation already occurs, and the extent to which such linkages are expected to increase.
To investigate the technical and political obstacles likely to bear upon the emergence of a multilateral military space effort within Europe.
This study focuses on an area of research which has received little attention in the past, but which is now at the forefront of the thinking of the relevant military planners.
As such, it provides a timely, independent academic input into the policy-making process.

Since the Stockholm Conference of 1971 first highlighted the issues, the international community has been slow to develop appropriate diplomatic machinery to cope with what are increasingly international environmental problems.
The UN Environmental Programme, UNEP, has, since 1972, developed as a small and well-respected research and information organization with headquarters in Nairobi, Kenya.
During the next decade an increased role for UNEP is envisaged, as a forum for global negotiations, particularly its part in negotiating a binding international convention to limit the emission of so-called ‘green-house gases’.
This project will investigate the expanding mandate, and the capacity of UNEP to match these demands, with particular attention to likely political and financial disputes.
The project will interview key personnel in the UNEP Secretariat and the permanent delegations of the member-states, with particular attention to the British government's role.
In addition, this project will consider the feasibility of using organs of the UN, such as the Security Council, for an expanded role in environmental diplomacy.

Controversy has surrounded the relationship between central and local government since 1979.
The Government has intensified its control of local expenditure and local councils have strongly opposed the policy.
But the problem of the level of local expenditure is not a new one and the policies of the Conservative government are not uniquely draconian.
This study aims to set the current problem in its context by describing developments in the relationship between central and local government between 1945 and 1983.
In so doing, it is not limited to the English local government system.
It compares the English experience with developments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
It also compares policy areas such as education, fire and social work rather than the institutions of central-local relationships.
The study not only describes changes in central-local relationships but it also attempts to explain them.
It explores the relative importance of such factors as Britain's economic decline, the structure of British government, the dominant style of policy-making and the resurgence of party ideology for understanding the changes.
The study draws together the results of five years' work by the investigator and the findings of the ESRC's extensive research programme in this field to provide the first comprehensive account of central-local relationships in the UK for nearly twenty years.

The crisis of the social sector of Mexican agriculture in the 1980's has attracted increasing attention in recent years.
However, the problems facing peasant producers are not only economic but also political given the control traditionally exercised by the PRI.
This research focuses on the tensions in State-peasant relations as autonomous producer organisations have emerged and demanded respect for their political independence and solutions to basic demands.
The changing nature of these relationships can tell us much about broader aspects of political change in Mexico, in particular the extent to which the corporatist pact with peasants, labour and popular sectors has been eroded by the impact of the economic crisis and the search for new forms of political representation within civil society.
The project will compare the political responses of national peasant movements to Mexico's agricultural crisis and assess their contribution to achieving political change in rural Mexico.

Recent years have seen a dramatic increase in research and publications on post-war British history.
Most of the official archives are now open for the Attlee, Churchill and Eden governments.
By 1995, historians will have access to all of the Macmillan and Douglas-Home years as well as the opening of the Wilson era.
Alongside this opening of the official archives, interest is now increasingly turning to the whereabouts and availability of private papers.
It is against this background that the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) has made a timely and substantial grant to the British Library of Political and Economic Science (BLPES), working in conjunction with the Institute of Contemporary British History, to conduct a major survey of just this area.
In essence, the project is a continuation of the highly-acclaimed survey of pre-1951 papers published as the 6 volume ‘Sources in British political history’(compiled by Chris Cook et al.).
These volumes became the vade mecum for modern British historians and political scientists.
The new survey, again directed by Dr Cook, began work in earnest earlier this year.
Peter Leese and David Waller have been appointed as research workers.
The survey is divided into two simultaneous operations which embrace the surviving records of both persons and organisations.
The intention is not only to record the whereabouts of existing and established collections, but to make available to researchers up-to-date information about less well known groups of records, especially those still in private hands.
The eventual published guide will consist of several hundred short entries which describe the content and scope of collections of papers and note their location and availability.
The project does not intend itself to collect actual papers and confines its attentions to non-governmental records only.
It is however prepared to advise on suitable locations for individual collections still in private hands.
The personal papers which are being surveyed include those of major political figures such as MPs and Ministers, as well as civil servants, colonial administrators and Governors.
Activists such as trade unionists, intellectuals, academics, feminists and various campaigners are also included.
The survey of organisations will cover political parties, trade unions, major industrial and employers' organisations, religious, environmental and ethical movements, and all manner of publicly active pressure groups from the single-issue to the well established.
The research team, based in the LSE library, may be contacted on 071 955 7221.
The project would welcome researchers in post-war British history contacting them concerning any papers they themselves may have discovered.

Brazil, accounting both in land and people for half of South America, is already firmly established as one of the leaders of the ‘Third World’.
With enormous natural resources, including more arable land than the whole of Western Europe, it is rapidly diversifying its agrarian economy, while, from its firmly established industrial base, it has pushed up its exports to record levels of about US 24 billion dollars.
It is, at the same time, currently suffering a severe economic crisis, with a foreign debt of about US 92 billion dollars, and showing all the strains of severe social and regional imbalance.
This research, which builds on earlier work financed by the ESRC, analyses the whole process of ‘redemocratisation’ in Brazil, including the vitally important elections of November 1982.
These elections brought opposition governors to power in 10 of 22 states, including the main centres of agrarian and industrial production, in Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, Parana and Minas Gerais.
‘Opposition’ states now embrace 58% of the population and nearly 80% of GNP.
Such ‘redemocratisation’ also involves profound changes in the relations between state and civil society.
New party groupings and alliances are being formed and new policies hammered out, influenced by internal pressures for social change and redistribution, by the impact of inflation and unemployment, and the urgent need to meet the demands of external agents, most notably the IMF and the international banking community.
This research especially focuses on Leonel Brizola and his government in Rio de Janeiro, but is concerned with the overall implications for national as well as regional policy formation contained in Brazil's new political alignments in the period up to the next change of president.
The work is of interest not only to the academic community, but to government, bankers and to all who are concerned with the shaping of policies in this most powerful and influential of the Latin American nations.

Decentralisation refers to three main features of central-local government relationships: the range of services for which local government authorities are responsible; the degree of discretion that local government authorities have in providing these services and the degree to which local politicians and officials can make their voices heard in policy making at the national level.
The research aims to explore the degree to which central-local relations in France, Italy, the United Kingdom, Spain, Norway, Sweden and Denmark vary on these three dimensions and why.
The research brings together academics from the countries included in the study to provide descriptive material on decentralisation for an edited publication.
The international collaborators will also provide the quantitative material covering the local government expenditure and income required for the evaluation of alternative theoretical explanations to be developed in a separate publication.

Electoral change in the constituencies which form the basis of Britain's political system is often equated with changes in residents' political preferences.
However, the British population is highly mobile (nearly 10 per cent move house in any year), and so political changes in some constituencies may reflect changes in the resident population rather than in individual voting habits.
This project is intended to explore the complex relationship between geographical mobility and voting.
The first task is to examine methods of estimating how many people move between constituencies, and what sort of people are most likely to move (e.g. which age groups, and which social classes?).
This is a topic of interest in its own right to geographers, planners, economists and sociologists, in addition to its implications for electoral change.
A range of data sources will be used to derive the best possible estimates.
Second, the effect of migration patterns on election results will be estimated for individual constituencies, in terms both of turnout and party support.
The British Election Surveys have shown how age, social class and other attributes are related to voting, and this information can be linked to findings on the attributes of migrants to assess how migration may have affected election results.

Britain is almost unique among Western democratic nations in maintaining no official record of the results of sub-national elections.
Several scholars have attempted periodically to collect such information for their own research concerns, but currently there is no comprehensive, consistent and computerised data base available to the whole research community.
This project aims t establish such a data base for all local government elections in England and Wales since local government reorganisation in 1973.
Results will be taken from the official figures as compiled by local returning officers, and particular attention paid to obtaining accurate information on ward electorates and party labels.
The value of the data base to researchers will be enhanced by the systematic inclusion of references to allow the identification of the parliamentary constituency within each ward falls; the tracing of changes in ward boundaries over the period since 1973; and the matching of ward level electoral data with material collected for the 1981 census.
A machine-readable data set for each diet of elections, and for elections in each tier of local government over time, will be deposited with the ESRC Data Archive.
The continued collection of local election results is assured for the foreseeable future thanks to the generous sponsorship given to Polytechnic South West by Local Government Chronicle.

This is a survey of attitudes towards civil and political rights in Britain based upon over 2000 interviews with the general public and over 1000 interviews with a political and governing elite, namely, party group leaders on local government councils throughout Britain.
The study is linked with similar recent or concurrent studies in Australia, Canada and the USA.
The British study uses an innovative survey research methodology based upon CATI (Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing).
What makes it truly innovative is that CATI techniques have been used to carry out a survey that is very different in design from traditional surveys.
This allows us to investigate the depth and stability, the malleability or rigidity of attitudes on a topic which is notoriously difficult to investigate.
Full details of the methodology will not be released until completion of the fieldwork.

The word Soviet in the title is used to cover the constituent republics of the Soviet Union.
It is intended to monitor the economic relations between these Republics collectively or singly to provide a basis for future studies in greater depth.
The main reason for this study is that the future economic development of the Soviet Republics depends very largely on trade in order to provide the currency for food provision and modernisation.
An increasing share of overseas earnings over the last 20 years has come from the sale of the dwindling assets of oil and natural gas.
The best hope of exporting industrial products is in the developing countries, some of which (eg the newly industrialised countries) may also be able to help in the Soviet modernisation programme, particularly the provision of consumer durables.
Is the development of such trade feasible under the new political and economic circumstances?
How is it being brought about?
What are the prognoses of success?
An aspect of the study will be the future of economic relations between the Soviet Republics and the former allies — Mongolia, China and Vietnam in particular, but also countries such as Ethiopia and other countries which have chosen the non-capitalist development road.

Partly because the trauma that attended the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi altered voting patterns, the loss of support by his centrist Congress Party to its rivals on the right and left was less marked than most observers anticipated.
(I discovered, however, that this generalisation applied with varying force in different regions.
In most regions, the assassination tended to unite the badly fragmented Congress Party, but in a few regions it had the opposite result, which caused that party to gain less ground in those states).
The gains made by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on the Hindu right were, however, still significant.
But a careful examination of the reasons for those gains in South India raise doubts about the hopes of the BJP to obtain a majority in the medium-term in the New Delhi parliament.
Its gains in the South — where it must score a major breakthrough to obtain a national majority — were mainly the result of a protest vote against the two other parties.
There was little enthusiasm there for the Hindu nationalist message of the BJP, and the party has little effective organisation in the South.
This, together with the disintegration of support for and the organisation of the Congress Party in North-central India indicate that it will be very difficult for any party to obtain parliamentary majorities in the near future.
(This may change, however, as the economic liberalisation undertaken by the present Congress government in New Delhi alters the political agenda.)

There has been no systematic nationwide study of the style and effectiveness of constituency-level campaigning in general elections in Britain.
Attention has been heavily concentrated on national campaigns and the activities of party leaders, despite the fact that there is some evidence to suggest that local campaigns may be becoming more important in influencing election results.
The project seeks to remedy this omission.
It involves a national postal survey of the election agents of major parties in the 1992 general election and interviews with the national and regional officials of the parties who are responsible for organising on-the-ground campaigning.
The research team includes people located in different parts of the country and they have carried out in-depth analyses of the campaign in 14 selected constituencies.
As part of this aspect of the project, a special study is being made of the role of local press and local radio and television in the campaign.
The study aims to present a descriptive account of election campaigning in Britain, considering in particular the use of new technology, and to assess the extent to which the outcome of the election was affected by the efforts put in by the parties and their volunteer workers in the constituencies.

The Project aims to establish the forms and extent of political participation by women in Northern Ireland.
Informed by critiques of the insufficiency of both the concept of ‘the political’ and hence, the orthodox measures by which political activities are estimated, the investigators have devised research techniques that enable them to explore the multi-faceted nature of political participation.
This provides the opportunity to test empirically whether the theoretical and largely feminist reconceptualisation of politics is borne out by incorporating a set of activities traditionally overlooked by conventional research into political behaviour.
The Province-wide project employs both quantitative and qualitative methods to collect data and includes a proportion of male respondents within the sample, thereby allowing comparisons of political participation to be drawn on the basis of, among other things, sex and gender.
The two-stage nature of the research — a large-scale social survey succeeded by follow-up interviews with sub-sets of the original sample — will enable the investigators to identify those factors that lead individuals to participate in (broadly defined) political activity.
Additionally, it will furnish original data and information about the political interests and attitudes of women in Northern Ireland together with comparable data for men.
In aggregate, the information gathered will offer a valid test of the assertion that in relation to politics women are inactive, ill-informed and uninterested.

This project is a study of the political economy of reforms in enterprise behaviour in Hungary and Yugoslavia from the late 1980s to the early 1990s, funded under the ESRC's East-West initiative.
Hungary started to introduce market-oriented reforms as long ago as 1968 and, after a period of retreat in the 1970s, renewed this reform process in the 1980s.
However, only at the end of the latter decade was the communist government replaced by a democratically elected government committed to comprehensive reform, involving liberalisation of prices, extensive privatisation, and related policies.
The interaction between political interests and economic policies will form an important focus of this research on the transition to the market in Hungary, as will a detailed investigation of enterprise datasets.
In Yugoslavia, the situation is more complex, because of the increasing political disunity in that country.
Nevertheless, the basic directions of economic reform are rather similar to Hungary, though the initial position is quite different, in that Yugoslavia already had long experience of worker-managed firms as well as a high degree of monetary mismanagement (including a spell of hyperinflation) resulting from inability of the country's federal structure to impose monetary discipline.
Hence the contrasts and similarities between the Yugoslav and Hungarian experiences of economic reform, which will be brought out in this project, should prove extremely interesting.
Finally, wherever it is relevant and helpful, the investigators will draw on available studies of the UK to widen the scope of the comparative element in this research.

In 1976 the British Government denounced the US/UK Bermuda Agreement, which had governed their civil aviation relations since 1947.
A new agreement was struck after much controversy in 1977 — Bermuda 2, but this was far from being the end of the matter.
The late 1970s proved to be the start of a new and unstable period for international aviation.
The controversy concerning the bilateral relationship between Britain and the USA was a symptom of this wider problem, which came to involve competition from new airlines — especially from the third world and developing countries, rising fuel prices, and deregulation policies.
The purpose of this research project is two-fold.
Firstly, the development of the Anglo-American civil aviation relationship in the troubled context of the 1980s and early 1990s will be explored and some assessment of its importance for determining the character of the world's overall aviation system will be given.
Secondly, the triangular relationship between the UK, the USA and the European Community will be examined in order to assess how civil aviation between them might develop in the near future.
Particular attention will be given to American fears of increased European protectionism after 1992 and the possibilities of a bilateral US/UK agreement to mitigate adverse effects arising from such policies.
The research will consist of interviews with airline executives and with officials from the US, the UK and the European Community.
In addition, official publications dealing with policy and some secondary source materials will be drawn upon.

Academic study of the members of the Conservative party at either national or local level has to date been almost entirely ignored.
Part of the reason for this lies with the decentralised nature of the party membership records but it has also been conventional political wisdom that Conservative party members play an insignificant role in the determination of the party's policies.
The common view has been that the Conservative party's structure is so rigidly hierarchical that there is little scope for initiatives from the party members.
It has also been widely assumed that members do not want to involvement in the policy-making process and that they join the party primarily for personal or social reasons.
These assumptions have ensured that we have little direct evidence about the social composition or the ideological profile of the Conservative party membership.
This research project aims to carry out the first national random sample of Conservative party members in order to explore some of the most important questions concerning their role and importance both within the Conservative party itself and additionally within the wider political system.

Since 1945 Nuffield College has sponsored a historical study of each British General Election.
This grant is to encourage the continuation of a series which has become an accepted and much quoted source of reference.
It continues a serious attempt to analyse what Namier called ‘a lock on the canal of British history’.
For the sake of continuity and comparison the authors intend to repeat almost all the established features of previous volumes.
But they will also seek new approaches as they record events and the reporting of the first post-Thatcher election.

The general issue area of third world military expenditure has a number of important repercussions in several general fields of study such as development, security or international political economy.
Despite both this importance and the continuous expansion of third world military expenditure, this topic is a relatively neglected area of study particularly as regards systematic statistical investigation.
The primary objectives of this project are to identify the determinants and consequences of third world military expenditure over the period 1950 to the present.
The form of the analysis is a multivariate statistical study based on longitudinal cross) national aggregate data.
The analysis of determinants entails the construction and testing of competing explanatory models; the impact analysis, partly due to control problems and partly due to difficulties in conceptualising impact, must of necessity be more ad hoc.
Determinants and consequences will be examined across six main clusters of variables, profiling conflict, balance of power, global incorporation, regime performance, regime structure and capabilities.

This grant will help to finance a conference of American, British and Soviet historians, to be held at Christ's College, Cambridge (1–5 July 1991).
This will assess the war efforts of each country under four headings,(diplomacy, strategy, economy, and home front) and also look at six areas of collaboration (ranging from cultural relations to the legacies of the alliance, including the origins of the cold war).
This is the second of three such conferences — one in each country.
The project originated from a proposal by the Institute of General History, Academy of Sciences of the USSR, Moscow.
It involves national teams of four/five historians and will result in a book to be published in all three countries in 1993.
In recent years, ‘glasnost’ in the USSR has made possible unprecedented intellectual contacts with the West.
Most, however, have resulted in ‘new thinking’ rather than‘new writing’.
This project will produce a major collaborative volume and, in the USSR, will disseminate Western scholarship throughout the Soviet higher education system.

It is now widely accepted in political science that democratic activity and representation not only consists of the electoral choice between parties and their programmes but in the contribution to policy making made by interest groups.
One of the main themes of the subject in recent years has been corporatism — which particularly drew attention to group participation.
In comparison with the elaborate quantitative data sets on voting we have little empirical information on this group phenomenon.
This project will attempt to gauge the volume of this activity, and attempt to distinguish different patterns of groups in different policy areas (sectoral approach).
It will also gather information on why individuals join groups (in defiance of the free rider prediction that says that collective action is illogical).

Greater cooperation between the countries of Western Europe, recent and prospective developments in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, and the changing relationship between the ‘super-powers’ in world affairs raise questions concerning the future of Europe and its role in the world in the twenty-first century.
THat role will depend, in part, on Europe continuing to overcome problems of disunity and conflict, and constituting itself as a unified and forward-looking community.

The ESRC has supported a cross-sectional or panel interview survey of a sample of the Great Britain electorate at every general election since 1964.
These studies have generated a substantial number of books and articles written by the principal investigators as well as a large literature based on secondary analysis of the data sets.
It is proposed to hold two sessions designed to allow the research community to reflect critically on what has been achieved by the BES in the past and what innovations in research design and theoretical focus should be introduced in the future.
The first session will include a presentation outlining the design of the ESRC- funded 1991/2 British Election Study; a report on the results of an ESRC-funded pilot study of the introduction of computer-assisted interviews into the British Election Study; and an alternative design for an election survey based on the research design utilised by equivalent studies in the United States and Canada.
The second session will consist of a round table discussion of the most recent major work to come out of the British Education Studies: ‘Understanding Political Change’, Pergamon, 1991) by Anthony Heath et al.

In the past decade, important changes have taken place in the leadership of Western and Eastern European states.
In Britain the trade union movement and the labour movement have been challenged by new political parties and a new form of conservatism has emerged.
In the Eastern states of Europe, the traditional form of communism has collapsed and the communist party and state apparatus has been superseded by a new cohort of political leaders.
The research will analyse the changing structure of leadership and the conditions which give rise to political stability and instability.
It will focus on the social and political origins of the newly forming political and business elites in Eastern Europe with particular reference to Russia and will analyze their place in the system of political power.
This will provide a background to the study of the impact of the changing structure of elites and on the distribution of wealth and income.
Of particular importance are on the one hand, the implications of the ‘reintroduction’ of the market to Russia and Eastern European societies and the impact of strengthened relations of private property and, on the other, the changing relationship of the state and market in Britain.
In addition to a comparison of the Soviet Union/Russia and Britain, the researchers are making contact with other research groups in Europe — particularly in France, Austria, Germany, Poland and Bulgaria.

This study of the Treasury as the department at the centre of management in British government has two main aims.
First, it will clarify and consolidate existing knowledge about the role of the Treasury in public policy-making.
Secondly, it will contribute to the advance of knowledge about the work of the Treasury in this context.
It will deal with three aspects of its subject.
First, it will provide information about the institutions currently involved with the Treasury's public policy-making role, including details of institutional background, recent changes and present structures.
Secondly, it will explain the process of policy-making with reference to the interests involved, including how various agencies interact and how policy-making processes relate to the parliamentary environment.
Thirdly, it will illustrate how the institutions and processes work in the case of a particular example relating to the annual financial cycle.
The emphasis will be on explaining and analysing how public policies are made, with the Treasury as the focus of attention.
The research will be based on library and documentary sources but will also benefit from interviews with certain officials.

Section Eleven of the Local Government Act, 1966, provides for the only specific grant paid to local authorities solely because of the presence of ‘New Commonwealth’ immigrants in their areas.
Local authorities have used the grant mainly to fund education posts.
Since 1976, the use of the grant by local authorities and its administration by the Home Office has been criticised.
In response to these criticisms, the Home Office introduced in January 1983 a new set of operational guidelines.
The research aims to provide evidence on the effects of the new guidelines.
The investigation considers the consequences of the guidelines for relations between the Home Office and Section Eleven authorities; what changes have occurred in local policy and practice, and how the new guidelines have affected grant take-up and distribution.
By identifying failings in the guidelines, the research provides a basis for considering possible reforms.
The principal methods of investigation are by interview, quantitative analysis and documentary analysis.
The investigation follows a project carried out between 1981-84, supported by the former SSRC.
This earlier project provides a comparative data base which will be used in assessing the impact of new guidelines.

The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Rio in June 1992 will celebrate the first steps towards a comprehensive international framework of agreements allowing developed and undeveloped countries to control the impact of global environmental change.
International agreements are the outcome of government negotiating positions which juggle perceived strategic interests, as seen by politicians and civil servants, with those impressed on the government by nationally-organised industrial, military, agricultural, and trade union sectoral interests, as well as scientific and other pressure groups.
Equally, governments' ability to enforce subsequent agreements, will depend both on the existing efficiency and administrative capacity of local States, and on the legitimacy of their taking positive action to defend the global environment, in the eyes of local interest groups.
This project will study the policy positions on global environmental change taken by three Latin American governments (Brazil, Colombia and Costa Rica) at UNCED and after it; monitor the impact on public opinion of the UNCED process itself, as expressed through magazine and news stories; and via interviews, evaluate the input of industrial, military, agricultural, trade union and voluntary organisations to the process of policy formation, in these three countries.
Due attention will be paid to the ongoing debate on the role and capacity of the State in Latin America.

The project aims to document and analyse a formative period in British space policy, civil and military, within the context of European and trans-Atlantic relations.
It will do so through the collection of a new body of data on an area of public policy which will contribute to our understanding of:— UK science and technology policy;— European collaboration in science and technology;— UK relations with Europe, at the time of the first attempt to join the Common Market;— UK relations with the USA, in an area of military as well as civil significance; the development of space launcher and satellite industry.
The project is based on the availability of official documents that will be released over the three years of its duration.
No previous history of policy so based has, or probably could have been, attempted.
In addition, it will draw upon archives in other European countries, and will be linked with work done on the official history of the European Space Agency at the European University Institute in Florence.

Problems of environmental pollution have in recent years become a matter of growing concern both in EC member states and at the EC level itself.
Over a longer period, environmental protection has developed within the EC from an unacknowledged sector of public policy to one of the central components in the strategy for European integration.
The move towards the Single European Market only highlights this trend but it also presents both problems of conflict and opportunities for complementarity between the developing environmental policies of the EC and the envisaged growth in trade and erosion of trade barriers that the creation of the SEM involves.
This team research project will provide an analysis of the policy process in six EC member states (three in each of Southern and Northern Europe) and also in the EC institutions for understanding how exactly the creation of the SEM will affect and be affected by environmental policy considerations.
It will also pay particular attention to the construction of expertise and the quality of comprehension of policy issues through focussing on the various policy communities and concentrating on three areas: urban air pollution, estuarine and coastal water quality and soil contamination.
The countries being investigated are: Spain, Italy, Greece, Germany, the Netherlands and the UK.
This project forms part of the Single Market Initiative of the ESRC.

Party membership is often thought of as a static phenomenon.
However, the first national survey of Labour party members, conducted in 1989/90, suggested otherwise.
There appears to be substantial numbers of people who join or leave, become active or inactive, over time.
By using panel survey methods, the recruitment and retention rates of members can be tracked over time.
Tests can be devised to ascertain whether changes in a person's lifestyle, or fluctuations in the party's electoral popularity, will affect membership.
Political activism of party members also varies over time.
This project aims to assess the impact of changed lifestyles, geographical mobility, employment status, and also political beliefs on levels of political activity.
Since 1987 the Labour party has undergone considerable changes in both policies and organisation.
The panel design will make it possible to track the responses of ordinary members to these internal party changes, and to the changes occurring in the external world.
The research involves collecting data from two random samples.
One is a sub-sample of the 1989/90 national sample of Labour party members and the second is a random sample of members recruited since 1988.

The use of warships to blockade Iraq and enforce UN Security Council sanctions after the invasion of Kuwait on 2 August 1990, served to focus world attention on the problems and possibilities of naval operations in support of United Nations resolutions.
The universal salience of peacekeeping in the post Cold-War world offers the prospect of widespread attention for a project designed to contribute to our understanding of the naval instrument as a force for security.
The research investigates the concepts of peacekeeping and peace enforcement as they might be applied to United Nations maritime operations.
The main focus will be on the political factors and conditions necessary for the creation of such forces, but the research will also address the possible roles and operational requirements of naval forces; and on the advantages and disadvantages for international security.
The project builds on the work on aspects of international security of the Mountbatten Centre for International Studies of the University of Southampton, a multi-disciplinary research centre situated within its Department of Politics.
The research is policy-related and involves the organisation of study groups to tap the expertise of those with operational experience of naval deployments.

The role of the state and the issues of democratisation, economic liberalisation, and territorial decentralisation are all being changed in the countries of Eastern Europe and the republics of the former Soviet Union in the rapid transitions from authoritarian rule by Soviet-style communist parties.
These transitions are likely to differ from recent western transitions from other types of authoritarian rule in a number of key respects.
First, transitions in post-communist countries will probably be accompanied by attempts at fundamental transformation of the economic system.
Second, local and regional government will have to be created and is more likely to require and use powers of economic initiative.
In addition there are some specific features often of great importance, such as the release of long suppressed aspirations for national sovereignty.
The aim of this project is to examine the linkages between democratisation, local decentralisation of power, and, to a lesser extent, economic marketisation.
Particular attention will be paid to differences in political culture and the role of linkages between local and regional interest groups in political developments.
The project will concentrate on Estonia, Russia, particularly the Leningrad area, and Poland.

The connection between trade unions and the Labour Party is one of the most important and contentious in British political life.
This research will reassess the relationship between trade unionism and the pursuit of party political goals in the light of the experience of the past two decades.
It will focus on four major problem areas:—
(1)
The cohesion of the relationship between trade unions and the Labour Party — seeking to explain those forces which hold the relationship together and those which move it apart.
(2)
The involvement of trade unions in the financial and organisational affairs of the Labour Party — seeking to explain the extent of their involvement, including the role and operation of the Trade Unions for a Labour Victory.
(3)
The changes in procedure and political alignment which have affected the operation of and attitudes towards, ‘the block vote’— seeking to explain the causes and consequences of new developments.
(4)
The recent role of the Trade Unions in the policy-making process of the Labour Party including the Liaison Committee and the new Joint Policy Committees — seeking to analyse the changing process and the new distribution of power.

Political behaviour and attitudes
How and why do British people participate in politics — and why do they not participate?
This broad-ranging study examines the ways in which people are involved in political life and their attitudes to this involvement, whether of satisfaction or disenchantment.
The research involves interviews with a representative cross- section of the nation's population and a more detailed survey of citizens and political leaders in six local communities.
In this way, it is intended to provide an overall picture of political activity in the nation as a whole, combined with a study of how local community factors affect the level and pattern of participation.
Do people participate more or less in villages, towns or cities?
Do people identify with the communities in which they live or with their professional, religious or ethnic communities and how does this affect their attitude to political involvement?
Political participation is being interpreted to include not only voting but also contacting MPs or councillors, taking part in demonstrations, signing petitions and joining pressure groups.
Where people do not take part in politics, the study enquires whether this is due to satisfaction, hostility or apathy and in what circumstances people might come to take a more active part.

There is widespread recognition that nearly all discussions of international peace and security over the last 45 years, and of policy implications for the UK, have been informed by the protracted global confrontation between the superpowers which has only recently, and so dramatically, crumbled.
This was true across a wide range of political and intellectual constituencies.
In the new global situation, there is a general loss of confidence in the ability of any agency to predict or control the future course of world events.
Commentators and analysts of all persuasions are becoming aware of the need to rethink many of the basic intellectual tools and resources necessary for understanding international relations.
To this end, a Workshop is to be held in May 1992, in association with the University of Manchester's Annual International Peace Lecture (to be given by Sir Crispin Tickell), to examine the questions of reconceptualising peace and security.
Amongst the themes to be explored are changing north-south and east-west relations; nationalism and religion; global environment and security.
The intended output will be the identification of areas where reconceptualisation is required, with a view to defining new lines of social science research which are likely to be relevant to future attempts at policy formulation, both nationally and internationally.

The research is directed towards an analysis of the relationship between governments and universities in a limited number of Third World Countries, the limits defined by factors they have in common.
The starting point is the British decision to found university institutions, linked originally to London University, in Uganda (Makerek), Nigeria (Ibadan), Ghana (Legon) and the University of the West Indies.
The model chosen was not simply London but the practice of higher education generally in Britain with more than a flavour, ab initio, of Oxford and Cambridge.
It included assumptions about the purposes for which universities are encouraged to teach and undertake research.
In this context, therefore, the research is about the transfer of ideas and institutions from a metropolitan centre to colonial countries.

The changes in the Soviet Union since the arrival in power of Gorbachev in 1984 and its abolition at the end of 1991 have left a number of subjects for scrutiny in the economic field.
One of these is the changing relationship of the former USSR and its separate parts on the one hand and the less developed countries (LDCs) on the other.
Some of the major questions to be asked are: what changes are occurring in the economic relations with former client states — Cuba, Mongolia and Vietnam — and how far is this affecting the latters' future economic development?
How much will these changes affect the future of other developing countries with Marxist or Soviet-orientated regimes, such as Ethiopia, Laos and Mozambique?
What is the economic effect of these changes on countries such as India, Turkey, Pakistan and Algeria whose industrialisation, particularly in the field of heavy engineering, has been the main outcome of such Soviet co-operation?
The research is aimed at drawing on the history of Soviet economic relations with the LDCs as a basis for monitoring the changes brought about first by ‘perestroika’ and then by the disintegration of the USSR; it will then analyse the effect on the developing countries concerned and evaluate the profit and loss account of their economic relations with the Soviet Union; it will also look at the relevance of these relations to the Soviet economy and that of the constituent republics; and finally it will try to look at the future prospects of the relationship between the less developed countries and the individual republics of the former Soviet Union.

Despite renewed contacts in 1984, the enmity between the two Korean regimes remains deep.
Both are heavily armed and enmeshed in security alliances with the superpowers and the major regional powers, and any conflict on the peninsula would have profound consequences.
Both regimes are also in a period of difficult political transition, the Northern regime attempting a form of hereditary socialist succession, and the Southern regime a peaceful transfer of power to a fully civilian government.
This research aims to monitor the continuing but tentative humanitarian, parliamentary and economic contacts between the regimes to detect any changes in their positions, and to gauge what impact their contacts are having upon their domestic politics.
Both Northern and Southern spokesmen will be interviewed in order to provide background for analysis of government statements and diplomatic manoeuvres.

The study of politics ought to have been transformed by the theory of voting and aspects of the theory of games, which underlie public choice.
The former shows that there is no non-paradoxical way of getting from individuals' preference to a coherent social choice; the latter, by analysing Chicken and Prisoners' Dilemma, clarifies the problem of voluntary co-operation to achieve valued goals.
In showing why individuals will not always co-operate to produce public goods (goods which are at least partly indivisible and/or non-excludable), it explains why governments are necessary.
But many of the outputs of governments are themselves public goods, so the problem is not resolved but merely transferred.
Much has been written about the pure theory of public choice but, in spite of a few pioneering works (the best known being Downs, An Economic Theory of Democracy and Olson, The Logic of Collective Action) there have been few recent applications in political science.
Among the questions to which this project aims to apply recent public choice research are ‘Why does anybody ever vote/work for a pressure group/stand for public office?’ 'What do bureaucrats seek to maximise?’'What (if any) political procedures ensure that what the people want is done?’

In the most recent attempt to reconstruct the European Community during 1981-1984, the role of Altiero Spinelli has been monumental.
He has been primarily responsible for the current European Union Treaty (EUT) which has effectively distilled a political idea into political practice.
The research seeks to provide a detailed examination of specifically federal ideas and influences in the current debate about European Union.
It is intended to demonstrate the continuing significance of federalism in the European Community's political and constitutional development.
This entails an analysis of the origins of European Union during 1969-1972 together with a survey of its fortunes and changing interpretations during the subsequent period 1972-1984.
Spinelli is the leading federalist in the European Parliament and it is crucial to understand both the political ideas and the political strategy which have combined to produce his recent initiative.
Interviews with Spinelli and other ‘elite opinion leaders will be used together with documentation from EC institutions to build up a developmental profile of key federal ideas and influences in the context of European Union.

This project is to establish a machine readable data set of non-Metropolitan County Council election results in England and Wales.
This information, based on the official records of Returning Officers, will initially be compiled for the 1981 elections and then expanded to include the results of those contests due in May 1985.
The value of these data, not currently collated in a systematic or comprehensive fashion, will be considerable for detailed research into local electoral behaviour and party competition.
The tape containing the raw material collected will be deposited at the ESRC Data Archive at the University of Essex and will be designed so that it can easily be analysed in conjunction with Census Small Areas Statistics.

A market economy cannot be created without changing the behaviour of Central and East Europeans who live four decades in a non-market economy.
The rejection of authoritarian socialism does not necessarily constitute proof of the rejection of programs and values associated with the social market or social democratic welfare state.
The object of this project is to test under what circumstances and to what extent people in post-Communist societies are developing values and patterns of behaviour consistent with market economies and social welfare as these terms are understood in Western Europe.
The project draws upon a unique Centre for the Study of Public Policy data base of nation-wide representative surveys of public opinion and behaviour in Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovenia, plus Austria and East and West Germany.
ESRC support will make it possible to test theories systematically and rigorously to answer such questions as: To what extent do differences in national cultures and tradition in Central and Eastern Europe cause different responses in post-Communist societies?
To what extent are Central European countries that have not been Sovietized (e.g. Austria and West Germany) similar or different from those that were?
How big are division within post-Communist societies according to age, gender, education etc?
To what extent do people of different nationalities but similar social characteristics, for example, urbanites, have more in common with each other than with fellow citizens with different characteristics, e.g. rural dwellers.

For many years it has been claimed that the level of taxes and services is an important factor in moving house.
This claim has led some to argue that the smaller the unit of local government the more likely it is that the mix of local taxes and services will mirror the population's desires.
It was used to justify the introduction of the poll tax and to justify breaking up metropolitan counties.
The model on which this claim is based has been extensively tested in the United States using aggregate data.
However, it has never been thoroughly tested in Britain nor have there been any systematic attempts to see if local taxes and services are important in actual decisions to move.
This survey of a large number of households, at a time of a very high-profile local tax — the poll tax — will demonstrate how important local taxes and services are in locational decisions.
It will examine all the factors which are considered when a household decides to move.
This project forms part of a wider investigation into the best structure of local government and forms of service provision by Keith Dowding and Peter John.

The United States resignation from the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) highlighted the problems of those large, universal membership organisations, loosely related to the United Nations and known as the Specialised Agencies.
The American decision cited excessive budgets, poor management and anti-western policies as their grounds for resignation.
These issues have been termed ‘politicization’, contrary to the founding state's intentions that the UN agencies should restrict their activities to closely defined and well managed scientific, and technical or so called‘functional tasks’.
UNESCO is the third such agency that the US has withdrawn from in less than a decade.
However after withdrawal from the International Labour Organisation (ILO) in 1977 and the International Atomic Energy Agency (1982) the Americans subsequently returned to full participation in these agencies.
This suggests an element of indecision in United States policy which provides the first point of investigation for this project.
Subsequently, this project will investigate the bases of the American decisions and the response to them by those third world governments accused of politicizing the agencies, the professional secretariats of the agencies coping with the consequences of American withdrawal and the views of the British government which has suggested a similar withdrawal from UNESCO, but from no other specialised agencies.
A particular concern of the investigation will be to examine the definition of politicization used by the US and to examine the effectiveness of using threats of resignation as a credible technique for managing the activities of those agencies which are the world's primary multi-lateral forums for the negotiation of global issues.

The research is concerned to develop a comparative history of the attitudes and policies adopted by socialist/labour parties towards questions of European integration since the 1920s.
A basic theme focuses on the extent to which uniquely domestic factors have affected a party's approach to these matters or how far the parties have responded to common stimuli.
The differentiation of the parties' approaches also takes account of variations in government/opposition roles, the influence of key personalities, the interpretation of socialist ideology, attitudes towards national sovereignty and supranationalism, the influence of geographic considerations, and distinctive historical legacies peculiar to particular societies.
The historical analysis also charts trends in the degree of consensus of approach existing between the parties, highlighting an increased level of agreement by the time of the second direct elections to the European Parliament in 1984.
The methodology includes personal interviews with party representatives, archive searches in national libraries, as well as secondary sources in the academic literature.

There is increasing interest in the impacts of closer European integration on British institutions.
Local authorities have had to respond to a wide range of legislation from Brussels and many have received substantial financial assistance, from the EC's ‘Structural Funds’ and other initiatives, for economic development projects (such as training and infrastructure provision) within their areas.
This project will examine the ways in which local authorities have been able to respond to the opportunities offered by closer European integration.
It will compare, in detail, the responses of a sample of 40 local authorities drawn from across Britain in order to:
1) identify those factors which have been most important in promoting changes within local authorities.
2) examine the impacts which ‘Europeanisation’ has had upon relationships between local authorities and other local agencies, British central government and the EC.
3) explain the variations in authorities' responses.
4) and identify how authorities can derive maximum benefits from EC programmes.
A wider survey of other authorities will also be undertaken to provide a comprehensive analysis of the pattern of changes within UK authorities as a whole.

Telecommunications is one of the fastest growing industries in the world.
It is of central importance in the revolution in ‘new technology’ currently being experienced in Britain and experienced worldwide.
As the chairman of British Telecom declared in 1982, the traditional role of telecommunications in voice communication is being rapidly superseded by ‘information exchange’ made possible by the merger of computer and communications systems.
The 1980s have seen important changes in the constitutional status of British Telecom.
Once an arm of the Post Office as a government department, telecommunications was first re-located (1969) in a public corporation and is now experiencing a ‘liberalisation’ phase as the present government has introduced an element of competition into the provision of telecommunication services through re-definition of the British Telecom monopoly.
‘Privatisation’ will, arguably, imbue the organisation with the ability to adapt more readily to a fast changing technological environment.
The present investigation monitors these changes by addressing two questions.
First, has ‘privatisation’ effectively freed the organisation from over-detailed government interference?
Secondly, has the injection of greater competition rendered the organisation more effective in a changing environment?

During the last few years the EMS has become a central plank of EC policy, and Economic and MOnetary Union has become the linchpin of the project for European Union constitutionalized in the Treaty on European Union.
There have been bitter arguments about whether the ‘hard’ ERM and EMU make sense either in economic terms or in terms of the best interests o promoting integration and the union project: arguments that have been intensified by the ERM crises of 1992 and 1993.
There is now a considerable economics literature in the costs and benefits of the EMS and EMU, but the policy process itself and its effects on the nature of policies is less well understood.
This project aims to investigate the nature of the different bargaining relationships that comprise the EMS and EMU and the ways in which they interact with each other.
Central to the methodology is a programme of interviews with leading participants in Britain, France, Germany and Italy, and in the EC institutions.
The research will provide a detailed picture of the way in which the EMS and EMU are managed; how they got to be managed in this way; and what realistically are the opportunities and constraints on economic and monetary policies in the EC.
In addition, the research will offer new insights into the under- researched area of central bank involvement and the nature of stages one and two of EMU.
The project forms part of a wider investigation of EC policy processes in different sectors.

This project aims to compare the range of public and private bodies which have an interest in industrial policy, and analyse the relationships between them.
The research looks in depth at the consumer electronics and telecommunications industries in Britain, France and West Germany.
The first part of the project discovers which organisations — including firms, government departments, trade unions and employers' associations — play a part in discussion about industrial policy.
In the main part of the research the relationships between these organisations are analysed by means of a large number of open ended interviews.
In particular the research should show the extent to which these relationships are interdependent; for example, how firms' own strategies are constrained by those of their competitors or suppliers, or how government agencies depend on private bodies for the information needed to formulate policy.
The research examines how the interactions between government and industry are affected by economic and technological change in the chosen industries, as well as by changes in government policy and the performance of national economies.
It will provide useful information for both the academic community and for practitioners about the role that governments play, or might play, in improving industrial performance.

The significance of cinema as a medium of mass entertainment and therefore as a potentially suitable weapon for political control was recognised by Lenin when he remarked, ‘Of all the arts, for us cinema is the most important.’
Despite the received view that everyone was watching films like The Battleship Potemkin, Lenin's vision began to be realised only at the end of the 1920's.
The research aims to show how the requirements of mass social and economic mobilisation associated with the Five Year Plan and the epoch of socialist construction made the need for political control more urgent.
It examines the relationships between politicians, film-makers, audiences and the actual films produced in the 1930's, the decade when much of the present structure of the Soviet film industry was established and the guiding canons of socialist realism were first elaborated.
The research continues Dr Taylor's previous work on the politics of Soviet cinema 1917-29 and on the use of film propaganda in the USSR and Nazi Germany and develops his long-term study of the history of propaganda in general.

The effectiveness of bodies established to provide vocational training is of crucial importance at a time of both high unemployment, and, paradoxically, a shortage of skilled workers in some sectors.
The project examines the nature of manpower training bodies in three sectors (textiles, engineering and hotel and catering) across three countries (Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland and the Netherlands).
Three interests are involved in manpower training bodies, namely employers, employees and government.
The project focuses on the manner and extent to which these interests can arrive at a common view on the objectives of vocational training.
It also investigates the connection, if any, between the generation of a common view and the nature and extent of training provided.
The results of the research should demonstrate how effective such tripartite training bodies are in fostering agreement on the training needs of the sectors concerned and in acting upon these needs.
Other factors which detract from agreement, or inhibit action, such as lack of finance, are also of interest.
Finally, by identifying variations in agreement and effectiveness between sectors and between countries, the research should lead to recommendations for improvement.
The research involves interviews and a questionnaire survey of more than 200 participants, as well as analysis of information on expenditure and courses provided by training bodies.

This project seeks to explain and assess the institutions and organisational structures which make up the government-industry ‘policy community’ on an internationally comparative basis.
Previous research on government-industry relations has concentrated either on rapidly declining industries such as steel or high technology sectors such as microelectronics; relatively little work has been done on the chemicals industry.
This research will map the linkages that make up the policy community in the chemicals industry in Britain, West Germany and at European Community level.
Earlier work which suggests that West Germany has a greater capability than Britain to deal with structural industrial crises through the cooperation of the state, employers, unions and financiers will be pursued in relation to the chemicals industry.
The research incorporates a case study of the ways in which the overcapacity problem in the petrochemicals and plastics sector has been handled in Britain and West Germany, together with a consideration of what the role of the European Community could and should be in the handling of overcapacity problems.

This project aims at monitoring by quantitative analysis some aspects of changes in the structure of British central government departments over the dozen years from 1972 to date.
It is a successor to a larger ESRC supported study by cross-sectional analysis of British central departments in 1976/7, which is reported in Bureaumetrics: the quantitative comparison of British central government agencies (Farnborough: Gower 1981), by C Hood and A Dunsire.
The project brings together figures about each of the major central departments over the years since 1972, including such items as budget, total staff, internal specialisation, and territorial dispersion; various ratios such as generalist administrators to specialists, ‘Ministers to Mandarins’, and the relative proportions of senior, middle-level and junior staff; measures of turnover in senior positions, and of overall structural change.
By combining such indicators, a quantitative picture can be presented of what has happened in British central government administration over the period both corporately and in individual departments; and the question of whether changes in one dimension are related to changes in others can be examined.
Like its predecessor, this research project is designed to operate mainly by the extraction and analysis of data from existing documentary sources, which are either published and freely available, or which are accessible to the investigators.
However, there is still some need, especially in the earlier stages, to talk to those responsible for management information at central (and perhaps also at departmental) level in Whitehall, about data sources relevant to the kinds of indicator the investigators are working with, and to seek advice about specific problems of interpretation.

The study examines the crowd and its political impact on the local community.
It seeks to discover how far recent crowd eruptions reflect feelings about the condition of the community rather than wider national concerns.
It inquires whether the conception of community has undergone any change as a consequence of the crowd phenomenon.
A study of community ‘elites looks at the reactions to political action.
A central feature is the attempt to elicit the degree of identification of a community.
Throughout, the activity of the crowd is being examined in relation to findings on conventional political participation.
The study is being conducted by interviews of ‘elite and mass respondents in four communities — two of which had experienced recent crowd disturbances and two which had not.
Crowd behaviour The Crowd Behaviour Panel was set up following the Report of the Joint ESRC/Sports Council Panel on Public Disorder and Sporting Events (1979); and following a seminar in 1981 the decision was taken to sponsor a series of research projects which would contribute to the understanding of contemporary crowd disturbances in Britain.
The main themes to be considered included:
(1)
Historical aspects: a description and analysis of crowds and related phenomena in recent British history.
(2)
Social context and social change: an analysis of the significant changes in social phenomena (youth culture, media, education) which together set the scene for the understanding of contemporary events.
(3)
Public order: the nature and changes in policy.
(4)
Particular events: topics within this theme focus on a selected event taking a developmental and interdisciplinary perspective.
(5)
Crowd psychology: the behaviour of crowds analysed from the perspective of psychology and social psychology.

This study involves a collaboration between the ESRC-funded University of Manchester British Political Participation Study (BPPS) and the Centre d'Etude et de Recherche sur la Vie Locale (CERVL) at the University of Bordeaux.
It builds on research which is already being undertaken in these centres and compares the involvement of citizens and local leaders in the politics and administration of a number of different communities in Britain and France.
The study will examine a number of questions which should be of concern to electors and to elected leaders and local government officials.
How far do people take part in the affairs of their communities?
Do they vote?
Do they attempt to influence councillors or officials?
What is the background of those who do get involved?
How satisfied are they with their experiences?
Some people may take action mainly on their own initiative.
Others may be drawn into local affairs by organisations such as parties or groups (‘Mobilization’).
For some citizens local affairs are seen as ‘political’ whilst others regard them as ‘non-political’.
Communities may vary in all these respects urban areas producing different responses to rural areas.
By bringing together the findings from local studies in France and Britain, BPPS and CERVL compare the experiences of similar types of communities in the two countries.
What differences do the two systems of local government make to the levels and patterns of participation and mobilization?
Are the French more satisfied than the British with the accessibility and effectiveness of their local leaders?
How do the two peoples evaluate their systems?
Is there anything we can learn from one another?
The information is being collected through survey questionnaires of citizens living in the community, personal interviews with local leaders and activists, documents and local newspapers.
The results will be published in French and English.

New forms of conventional weapons stemming from advances in chip-based micro-electronics and in software engineering at first sight appear to make the goal of a less nuclear-dependent posture for the defence of Western Europe strategically feasible and economically affordable.
The problems and opportunities that new conventional weapons technology —‘emerging technology’— presents for an efficient allocation of effort as between the research and production capabilities, and the force contributions, of the NATO allies are likely to be considerable.
Identifying the key industrial capabilities for the manufacture of advanced conventional weapons as software engineering on the one hand and large scale chip-based integrated circuit production on the other, a survey will be made of Britain's and other NATO countries' industrial resources in these two sectors.
If national production capability is one factor influencing the rate at which Britain and other NATO countries will equip with emerging technology conventional weapons, another is the demands these weapons will make on the quality and quantity of military manpower at the country's disposal.
Research concentrates chiefly on throwing light on two unknowns: will the new weapons lead to manpower savings; and what demands will the new weapons make upon the skill of the average soldier.
Everywhere the aim of the research is to improve public understanding of a development in warfare that is arguably the most important, and certainly the most hedged about with technical complexity, since nuclear weapons.

Communications and information policy is now of paramount importance to Western industrialised nations, in terms of productivity, exports, imports, inward/outward capital investment, and technological competitiveness.
Technical change within the IT sector is taking place at a fast pace as data processing, microchips, telecommunications, image broadcasting and satellite transmission coalesce.
How do governments intervene to control that technology, foster innovation or regulate the market?
The research aims to compare the policies of the American, Japanese and British Governments towards the IT sector.
What means do these governments use to protect, regulate, subsidise or stimulate the sector?
What are the relations between state and industry in each of the countries and how do they differ?
Is the technology forcing similar mechanisms of intervention onto governments with differing ideologies and onto states with differing institutional lay-outs?
How do American and Japanese policies affect Britain, and through Britain, Europe?
Following on from the author's Information Technology and Industrial Policy (Croom Helm 1984), the research uses a variety of written sources, ranging from government documents to trade papers, coupled with interviews with policy-making personnel.
Publications from the research so far include: ‘Information and Telecommunications Policy in Europe’ in A E Cawkell ed.

Welfare policy in the UK is changing rapidly.
The private and voluntary sectors have expanded, state spending is constrained and the most important review of social security since the Beveridge report has recommended radical new policies to meet the needs of the unemployed, tenants and pensioners.
This study is designed to gather information on the attitudes of Members of the House of Commons and the House of Lords on the main principles which should underline welfare policy.
The information will be compared with the picture of attitudes of the population at large gained from the annual British Social Attitudes survey (supported by the Economic and Social Research Council) and other sources.
The comparison will show how far politicians' views reflect those of the citizens, and hence the extent to which policy is likely to meet with popular approval.
Knowledge of politicians' attitudes will also contribute to an assessment of the scope for change in welfare state policies.
The identification of areas in which there is bipartisan agreement on the desirability of change or of the maintenance of existing services will be of particular interest.
The survey will be carried out using a questionnaire in interviews with about a hundred MPs, chosen to represent the main grouping within parties, and ten Peers who have shown interest in welfare issues.
An additional postal questionnaire will be sent to all members of the House of Commons

The use of British official records relating to colonial development and decolonisation tends at present to be limited by the lack of an adequate guide to the machinery of government concerned with colonial affairs, and the resultant records, as it evolved from the relative autonomy of the Colonial Office in 1925 to the highly integrated national and international system obtaining at the onset of rapid decolonisation.
The ever broadening range of involvement by government departments makes it difficult to trace the evolution of policy through Whitehall or to interpret decision making in development planning, and researchers are presented with a bewildering complexity of sources which hinders efficient and economic research.
The project seeks to examine, through academic research and archival description, the origins and growth of ideas about colonial development and welfare, to describe the growth of those parts of the UK government machine which were concerned and to pinpoint relevant official records.
The examination will be carried out in two phases: an update to 1968 of the out of print Public Record Office handbook on the records of the Colonial and Dominions Offices, building on a draft by Professor J M Lee, and a detailed guide to policy files across departmental boundaries between 1925 and 1957, both to be published as PRO handbooks.
The work is undertaken in co-operation with the PRO.

The object of the research is to edit and prepare for publication two of Jeremy Bentham's major works on constitutional government as a sub-project within the framework of the new edition of the Collected Works.
With the publication of Constitutional Code, Volume 1 in 1983, the foundations have been laid for a series of volumes of special interest to students of constitutional law, political theory and government.
If the Constitutional Code has revealed Bentham as an important theorist of representative democracy, the volumes to be edited will establish him as a major theorist of constitutional government generally.
The two volumes will be entitled First Principles preparatory to constitutional code and Writings for Greece and Tripoli.
Early in 1822, when Bentham was beginning to undertake the drafting of the Constitutional Code, he wrote a substantial manuscript which brought together several strands in his constitutional thought to serve, as he intended at the time, as an introduction to the Code.
The theme of this manuscript could be called ‘public economy’, directed at achieving efficient and intelligent arrangements.
As Bentham moved into the detailed drafting of the Code, this preparatory work was set aside, and it has never been published.
During late 1822 and early 1823, Bentham became involved in two projects which contributed to the development of his constitutional thought.
The first of these arose from his friendship with Hassuna D'Ghies, the young ambassador from Tripoli to the Court of St James, for whom Bentham wrote an important manuscript, ‘Securities against Misrule’.
This proposed in detail a series of measures designed to introduce a more liberal and accountable constitutional structure into an authoritarian Moslem state.
The second project resulted from an invitation from the leaders of the new Greek government in 1823 to comment on the recently adopted Constitution of Epidaurus (1822).
Bentham's ‘Observations’ were written in February 1823 and presented to the Greek legislature amidst general acclaim, but the work was never published in Greece or Great Britain and the only known copy is the manuscript in the Bentham Collection in University College London.
Bentham here explores a number of themes of importance to constitutional theory; the separation of powers, the exclusion of minorities from suffrage and office, popular sovereignty, and political accountability.
The volumes will be produced with the use of new technology in editing and printing and will be based at the Bentham Project which has been supported by earlier ESRC grants.

To a real extent the quality of democracy in Britain rests on ordinary people.
But, we know surprisingly little of a systematic nature about what ordinary people nowadays think of the subject.
This project is intended to help fill the gap.
Up to 180 people, 30 in each of six very different localities in Britain — a Welsh mining village, a London inner city area, scattered rural villages in Scotland etc — are being interviewed in depth about their experiences and perceptions of Britain's political processes and institutions.
They have been selected through prior quantitative analysis of surveys in these areas, an analysis identifying those particular individuals who have been very active in national and/or public life.
In this sense, they arguably form collectively a sampling of the crucial foundation, at grass-roots level, of Britain's political system.
Hence, their views, based as they are on personal first-hand experiences, form an important body of evidence about whether or to what extent Britain lives up to its reputation as a liberal democratic country.

Since the mid-1970's, English local authorities have been under increasing financial pressure.
The demands on their budgets have increased both as a result of inflation pushing up costs faster than the retail price index and as a result of increased demand on their services.
Meanwhile sources of revenue income under their control (in particular the rates) have been relatively inelastic and levels of government grant have fallen.
The response of local authorities to these pressures will determine whether adequate provision is still available and whether central government controls will have the effects their supporters hope for.
In the past it has generally been assumed either that spending patterns will change incrementally from year to year or be based on some more or less rational overview of budgets.
If, however, adjustments are made on the basis of political bargaining within the officer and councillor structure, the consequences of external pressure on budgets may be unpredictable and result neither in overall cuts in spending nor in the hoped for shifts between budget heads.
On the basis of six detailed case studies, the project aims to identify the ways in which bargaining takes place within local authorities, particularly in the context of the Rates Act.

The Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 requires all police authorities to make arrangements ‘for obtaining the views of the people’ about the policing of their area and for enlisting their co-operation for crime prevention.
The research aims to describe how police authorities give effect to this duty and to analyse what the consequences of their adopting different strategies — formal consultative committees, public opinion surveys, informal liaison etc — are for the work of police authorities, for policing priorities and for police management practice.
The researchers will survey consultative arrangements nationally and will monitor advice offered from the centre by means of Home Office circulars, Inspectorate of Constabulary comments, local authority association working parties etc.
Six police authorities, representing a range of policing conditions, will be studied closely drawing on policy documents, interviews and observations.
The research follows pilot work carried out in 1983-4 (supported by ESRC and the Police Foundation) as a result of which a national survey of early consultative arrangements, Following Scarman?, was published in June 1984.

This study compares regulation in two of the world's greatest stock markets.
The markets in London and New York are usually pictured in contrasting terms: in the former, legal controls are comparatively unimportant and ‘self-regulation’ is the norm; across the Atlantic an elaborate legal code is administered by a public agency, the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Defenders of the British system claim that self-regulation produces responsive and innovative markets, while legal controls are said to inhibit change and flexibility.
Yet the most sweeping changes and the most fertile inventions have in the last decade come from New York.
This study examines these contrasts in detail, at a period when the Stock Exchange in London is introducing great reforms.
The issues analysed include the adequacy of ‘investor protection’ in highly competitive financial markets; the responsiveness of stock markets to the demands of the wider economy and to the policies of government; the impact of competition on regulations; and the lessons, if any, which New York can teach London.
The research is based on primary sources, including interviews with those concerned with regulation in both Britain and the United States.

Research on corporatism has largely been confined to the level of the political centre of the nation state.
Little attention has been paid in the UK to intermediate levels of government.
Scotland represents an interesting arena for research on corporatism because of its distinctive history, separate legal system and institutions.
The research aims to find out whether there is a specifically Scottish corporatism that can be distinguished from that found at the UK level.
The investigation examines both formal and informal arrangements to identify the type and strength of linkages.
By looking in addition at instances of corporatist response to particular cases of industrial crises, the importance of voluntaristic concertation can be assessed.
The research attempts to investigate the benefits and disadvantages of such arrangements for the partners concerned.
The way in which Scotland lobbies for’ the Scottish interest’and internally how the Scottish cake is split up between different partners are to be examined.
The research programme concentrates upon a range of policy spheres where the growth of ‘corporatist arrangements’ has been sufficiently conspicuous and sufficiently contentious to have given rise to the term ‘corporatism’with its suggestion of a qualitative change in the politico-economic structure.
The projects chosen consider a number of issues which include accountability and social and economic efficiency, public and third part accountability, sectional interests and the general interest, and evidence on the efficacy of concertation in macro-economic policy.
These themes are pursued across a range of tripartite associations in differing sectors of the economy.

This multidisciplinary research programme has been developed in response to the growing emphasis on management in British Central Government, with its concern for the more effective performance of functions and the more efficient use of resources.
The programme is focused on the following six fields of research:
(i)
the development of a managerialist approach in the Civil Service;
(ii)
the acquisition and rewarding of management skills;
(iii)
the pursuit of enhanced efficiency, its measurement and consequences;
(iv)
the dispersion and concentration of responsibilities;
(v)
organisational change and design;
(vi)
the political and constitutional effects of these management developments.
A three-year programme of research has now been commissioned by the Management in Government sub-committee within a total budget of 350,000.
It is expected that the results of the research programme will be of interest and utility to those in government, as well as contributing to the more theoretical aspects of the subject.

The aim of this programme is to investigate, analyse and clarify the various linkages between government and industry that exists both in this country and in its major competitors.
The research programme examines the main institutions and agencies, and focuses on questions such as the means by which industry seeks to influence government and vice versa; the regulatory framework which affects behaviour; the financial transactions between the two parties; the representation between unions and business and government agencies and the forums in which they take place.
A second phase has recently been commissioned which extends to Japan and United States the comparative work already begun with the UK, West Germany and France.
The new projects will investigate industrial change through three emergency international policy issues: regulation; the promotion and adoption of new technologies; and industrial restructuring.
The programme will conclude with a multi-country study of policy issues and policy processes in at least three of the countries studied.

The expanded role and influence of neutral and non-aligned states since the mid-1950s has transformed contemporary international relations.
The research analyses the development of political and legal views in the Soviet Union about the nature and functions of neutrality, neutralism and non-alignment, and assesses the impact of these views on the conduct of Soviet foreign policy.
The intention is to reveal how distinct Soviet attitudes to neutrality, neutralism and non-alignment have underlain the practical relations of the USSR and the countries defined by these terms in Europe and the Third World.
This will assist an understanding of the foreign policy options available to these countries both historically and in contemporary affairs, and clarify Soviet expectations of, and involvement in, the regions lying outside the great power alliance systems.
Particular attention will be paid to the factors assisting or retarding the acceptance of Soviet interpretations of non-alignment in South Asia.
This project follows a doctoral thesis, supported by the ESRC, on postwar Soviet relations with neutral Finland, and relies similarly on official publications and documents, press material, interviews, and scholarly works.

This research follows on from that reported in Deregulating Telecoms: Competition and Control in the United States, Japan and Britain (Frances Pinter, 1986) where the processes of liberalisation and privatisation of domestic and international telecommunications were compared.
Whilst the project will provide an overall view of policy within the Information Technology sector, detailed analysis will focus on mechanisms of re-regulation of telecommunications within the three countries and policies both national and international on standardisation of equipment and network interfaces.

The European Parliament, the Community's legislative assembly, is attaining an influence in cross-national affairs within Europe, as well as between Europe and other state groupings, which belies its newness.
However, because it is new, there is no single systematic source of information about its elected members--who they are, their particular interests and their political activities.
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENTARIAN, which will be a computerised databank of material about the Members of the European Parliament, is designed to fill this gap using the latest in information handling technology.
In its first phase, the project will consolidate fundamental demographic and biographical information, extracted from a variety of sources, about the Members of the current session of Parliament.
This information will be maintained on a micro-computer in a format compatible with the leading data base management strategy so as to permit the later addition of information about individual Member's voting behaviour, committee memberships, debate participation and career paths.
Besides its support for reports and analyses of current activities in the European Parliament, the EUROPEAN PARLIAMENTARIAN will be used for three longer-term studies.
These are:
(a)
an analysis of European politicians' careers;
(b)
an evaluation of emerging patterns of representation within Europe; and
(c)
an evaluation of the application of ‘business-oriented’ computer software in social research.

This study will focus on the political processes which promote transitions from authoritarian to democratic regimes.
Despite the importance of this topic in a world where liberal democratic values are constantly under threat, relatively little attention has been paid to it.
The emphasis of many previous studies has been on the ‘breakdown of democratic regimes’ rather than their achievement and consolidation; and they have tended to highlight economic constraints or global influences rather than national political choices and strategies.
The study will isolate key aspects of the successful transition to democracy in Spain, and examine how important they are to contemporary
democratic initiatives in Brazil and Mexico.
The main premise is that the corporatist strategies developed almost universally by authoritarian regimes in order to organize and control civil society, serve simultaneously to create the political context for popular responses; and special attention will therefore be paid to the ways in which unions, community groups and parties find the political space to organize within the institutions of these regimes.
The analytical insights gained during a year's research in Spain (1982-83) will be used to explore the relevant range of secondary sources, and collections of primary data, on Brazil and Mexico.

This project has two foci: one examining the implications which Islamic conceptions of the state have for Middle Eastern politics, the other examining the implications these conceptions have for the substantial Muslim community now resident in Britain.
Under the first focus, the project seeks to develop a coherent explanation of the political, economic and social dynamics of the Middle Eastern region--by examining the interaction between, on the one hand, Islamic ideas and social organisation and, on the other hand, the political and economic structures of contemporary Middle Eastern states.
Among the central topics under examination are the Islamic theory of the state; and the relevance of social groupings for the shaping of conceptions of the Muslim state.
Country studies, investigating particular aspects of Islam's political role in specific states, cover the following areas:
i) Islam as official ideology: Saudi Arabia;
ii) Islamic protest movements: Egypt;
iii) Islam and revolution: Iran;
iv) Islamic resistance to Muslim-minority rule: Syria;
v) Islamic resistance to Christian-minority rule: Lebanon; vi) Islam in a populist military regime: Libya.
Under the second overall focus, the project examines how Islamic conceptions affect the attitudes of Muslims in Britain towards political participation and towards the processes and procedures of government.

Given the centralised nature of Soviet politics and the dominant position of the Communist Party, a change in party leadership is likely to have more significance in that country than in political systems elsewhere.
The election of a new and younger General Secretary in March 1985, dedicated to an apparently far-reaching programme of ‘reconstruction’ and ‘acceleration’, raises questions of the nature and limits of political change in the USSR of a particularly interesting kind.
In this research, the investigators shall be examining the process of change under several different headings: the economy; social relations; and political institutions, drawing for the most part upon Soviet newspapers and journals, which have become a much better guide to the process of change under current policies of glasnost or openness.
The objectives and policies of the new leadership have been widely discussed in the West; in this research the investigators hope to round out this picture by devoting particular attention to the nature, limitations of, and resistance to, change in the world's largest communist-ruled country.

This study follows on from earlier survey work by the investigator for the Widdicombe Committee.
The central question is this: do local elections imply local politics?
Local elections would not imply the existence of local politics if local election behaviour simply reflected attitudes towards national politics.
Approximately 1,100 respondents were interviewed in November 1985 and 750 reinterviewed just after the local elections in May 1986.
It was possible to measure the stability, and hence the meaningfulness, of many attitudes towards local government.
By comparing political choices for national and local elections as expressed in November 1985 and again in May 1986, and contrasting those respondents who lived in areas with elections (in May 1986) with those who lived in places without elections (in May 1986) it was possible to unravel the complexities of the relationships
(i)
between national and local political choices and
(ii)
between voting intentions and actual voting behaviour.
The results overturn previous findings.

How do Prime Ministers and Presidents organise their publicity, and with what results?
How far do they see publicity as an instrument of power?
And what difference has TV made to them, both by invading old political arenas such as legislatures and by creating new arenas such as studio interviews and televised ‘debates’?
The research will compare the development of Prime Ministers' press offices in three ‘Westminster systems'--London, Ottawa and Canberra--and the President's press office in the White House.
Some comparison will also be made with Paris and Bonn.
For the American President, power is conventionally ‘the power to persuade’, and the President's press secretary is often amongst his closest advisers--on policy as well as presentation.
In parliamentary systems, too, Prime Ministers seem increasingly active in managing their media relations.
The study explores the priority Heads of Government have attached to publicity, and their attitudes to official secrecy and leaks as well as to the political accountability of news media.
Do media relations take up increasing time?
How do they affect the ‘job description’?
In particular, do they affect not only the presentation but the substance of government decisions?
And what effects do they have on Prime Ministers' and Presidents' relations with their colleagues and on the nature of their power?

Those who exercise power or authority over others typically claim legitimacy for doing so, ie that their position and actions are justified according to recognised principles.
Why is it necessary for them to make such a claim?
How important is it that those subordinate to them accept it?
By what means is that acceptance secured?
What happens when legitimacy is eroded or breaks down?
How can it be re-established once this happens?
These questions are all central to the study of politics.
Although at first sight the answers to them seem obvious, they become much more complex and contestable when subjected to closer examination, and they have never been systematically brought together, or the questions definitively resolved.
The purpose of the research is to carry out a critical analysis of the literature both on the role of beliefs in social and political order, and on the principles of legitimacy of particular regimes, so as to develop a systematic theory about the legitimation of power.
The value of the project will be to increase our understanding of the conditions for social and political stability and instability in the contemporary world.

This grant is to complete the work started under ESRC grant B/00/23/2053 for July-December 1984 and March-October 1985.
This is believed to be the first time that an attempt has been made to compile a complete statistical record of Soviet economic development assistance to the less developed countries since it started on a formal basis in 1954; by 1983 such assistance had gone to a total of 57 countries.
The statistics are based on the original agreements (published in the Soviet annual treaty series as a rule).
Estimates are made of drawings on these amounts by the combined evidence of the advancement of project construction, statistics of trade deliveries and other pointers.
Repayments and interest have then been calculated according to the terms of the agreement and the estimates of drawings.
These estimates were discussed with local officials in a cross-section of 13 of the recipient countries and with the Soviet economic experts in 8 of them.
Since there is normally no movement of funds there can be no such thing as exact financial statistics.
The method used in this research, however, is likely to give a very close picture of the scope of Soviet economic development assistance on ‘aid’ terms.
The addition of tables in current and constant prices makes possible comparisons with other aid donors and a study of the trends and fluctuations in Soviet economic assistance in real terms.
The research is likely to prove a useful reference tool for the study of Soviet economic relations with the developing world, the role of Soviet aid in the domestic economies of the developing countries, and the comparative burden of this aid on the Soviet economy.
The statistics include notes on the Soviet assistance to each country and are to be published by Oxford University Press.

Embarrassed to some extent by their traditional association with the Soviet Union, but at the same time drawing their identity from it, the communist parties of Western Europe have been passing through a period of internal crisis and conflict.
They are seeking new supports that are at one and the same time local and yet related to their universal goals.
They need a new identity, but in seeking it they find themselves competing for the same political space with social movements that share their radical vocation.
The research concentrates on five countries of Western Europe in which the relationship between communism and single-issue radical movements is particularly salient: France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.
It examines the impact of the growth of peace and ecology movements on the communist parties of those countries.
The research is part of a longer-term project covering peace and ecology movements in Eastern and Western Europe in relation to ruling and non-ruling communist parties.

This project aims to carry out a study of policy thinking at the elite level in Britain and America.
A sample of Congressmen and Parliamentary Backbenchers will be interviewed.
Part of the sample will be chosen because of their expertise in the relevant policy area, which is defence and foreign affairs., A control sample will also be taken of those whose legislative specialities are distant from this.
The main focus of the project will be on the ratiocinate process, and information sources and information processing of the elite.
In this way the study diverges from the usual tradition of elite studies where emphasis has been placed on ideological response or constituency service as the key to understanding the adoption of attitudes in such an elite.

The main aim of the programme is to improve British understanding of the nature and sources of Soviet foreign policy, particularly in Europe, by expanding scholarly research in this field and facilitating discussion between academics and practitioners, thus fostering a more informed public debate on this key policy issue.
The programme seeks to bring a stronger British and West European perspective to Western scholarly and public policy discussion of Soviet foreign policy.
The research plans to produce five studies resulting in collaborative volumes as well as a larger number of shorter studies published in the form of occasional papers.
The longer studies focus on aspects of Soviet capabilities and conduct of particular relevance to East-West relations in Europe.
Projects here include an examination of West European interests in Eastern Europe; a study of Soviet relations with Britain; West European experience of negotiating with the Soviet Union; and the impact of information technology on the Soviet system.
Among the shorter studies planned are the following: an examination of recent developments and debates within the Soviet military elite; an analysis of the capacity of Western economic pressures to affect Soviet defence and foreign policy; Soviet perceptions of Western Europe; how and by whom Soviet defence and foreign policy is made; the USSR and Cuba as a case study of Soviet relations with a ‘client’ state.
Two full-time researchers at the RIIA will undertake a part of this research and coordinate a good deal of team work involving British academics and practitioners as well as in some cases scholars from Western Europe.
Conferences and seminars as well as publications will ensure that research results reach a wider interested audience.

Central Government possesses a number of mechanisms for evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of the services for which it is responsible.
They include inspectorates, audit bodies, scientific research bodies and management consultants, all of which come from different traditions of evaluation.
The research examines the authority and workings of these different bodies and the effect of the different traditions of evaluation from which they are derived.
It also examines the relationships between these bodies and those that are the subjects of evaluation, as well as with central government departments.
These issues are analysed against the various theories of evaluation.

The first SSRC studies of the British electorate focused upon the enduring foundations of political choice, upon class backgrounds, class loyalties, and deep psychological feelings of attachment to political parties.
These aspects of political choice are still important but less so now than in the past.
The electorate is now more volatile, more responsive to events and arguments, less constrained by enduring loyalties.
New parties partly reflect the breakdown of old loyalties but they also encourage volatility by offering a wider range of choice
In an era of weakened loyalties and rapid political change we have to address new questions and use new technologies.
The 1987/88 British Election Campaign Study focuses upon the problems of weak and divided loyalties and very rapid, even daily, changes of mood and intention.
Its focus is on matters such as the changing images of leaders and parties presented by the media, simultaneous preferences for more than one party, and developing perceptions of the opportunity for tactical voting.
Above all, this study focuses upon change --which requires new techniques of measurement and analysis.
To detect change it uses quantitative rather than qualitative measures, multi-wave panels (ie repeated interviews with the same panel of respondents), and telephone interviewing techniques which allow day by day measurements of changing perceptions and opinions throughout the election campaign.
There are links with similar studies in the USA and Canada.

The main objective of the project is to examine the nature of the relationship between the pharmaceutical industry and government in Japan and the UK.
Unlike most industries the pharmaceutical industry does not have a simple, direct relationship with the customer but rather a complex interaction with the medical profession, the health care system and the general public.
So, in addition to research and sales it is necessary to consider a number of interfaces which the industry has with different branches of the government machinery.
In a general sense, the investigators wish to investigate how policies are devised, the nature of the policies which have been implemented and the effect of these policies on the development of the industry in the two states.
In particular, the investigators examine how industry and government have responded to the challenge presented by the emergence of biotechnology with its potential to generate new, powerful and profitable drugs which will supersede many currently in use.
This will have a profound influence on the structure of the industry in the way it encourages the emergence of new corporate actors in the sector.

This study attempts to assess the impact of general management on a sample of NHS health authorities.
It does this by a study in depth of a structured sample of English Regional and District Health Authorities and two Scottish Health Boards.
The research is carried out by means of a combination of direct observation, interviews and documentary study.
It seeks to compare the benefits originally claimed for general management in the various official statements concerning the acceptance of the Griffiths Report with the actual impact at Regional and District levels within the NHS.
One of the final products of the research should be an identification of factors which assist, and factors which hinder the effective implementation of general management.
More broadly, the project seeks to analyse the promulgation of a ‘managerialist’ philosophy within the NHS.

This project carries out a study of the electorate, designed to be a continuation of the uninterrupted series of academic studies started by Butler and Stokes in the 1960s, taken up by Sarlvik and Crewe throughout the 1970s, and by the present investigators in 1983.
The election studies constitute perhaps the most widely used social science resource in Britain, and one of their greatest strengths is their continuity — not only in their coverage of every general election since 1964 but also in their design and conduct.
The project has two central purposes.
The first is the provision of a data set which will be of general value to the social scientific community and which will enable scholars in the field of electoral behaviour to update and develop their research.
To this end the project places great emphasis upon the conduct of the survey work to the highest professional standards, upon achieving comparability with the previous studies in the series, and upon speedy deposit of the data set with the ESRC Data Archive at Essex.
The second purpose is to build upon the work that the investigators and others have previously done and to investigate a number of specific theoretical issues.
The investigators wish in particular to develop their work integrating social structural and attitudinal approaches to voting behaviour, to explore the importance of neighbourhood and social networks, and to test the ‘party identity’ and ‘rational choice’theories of voting behaviour.
Further analysis of these topics should contribute both to an understanding of the substantive trends in British electoral politics in the 1980s and to the advancement of general theories of voting behaviour.

This research is part of the second phase of the ESRC ‘managed initiative’ on government/industry relations.
It will concentrate on developments in telecommunications--widely judged to be a sector of crucial infrastructural significance to the development of advanced industrial economies.
Consistent with the commitment of the ESRC programme to an investigation of the inter-relationships between ‘government’ and ‘industry’,(of both academic importance and practical relevance to an understanding of industrial competitiveness and performance) the research team--multidisciplinary in composition--will attempt to chart the shifting terrain of US and British telecommunications policy making in the wake of important technological and political changes.
Telecommunications, widely characterised as of increasing and, indeed crucial infrastructural significance in advanced economies, is a rapidly changing ‘policy area’.
The US and Britain share a common experience of advancing telecommunications technology (witness the merging of telecommunications and computing technologies) and a commitment to deregulation of the telecommunications network.
The research will seek to identify the key ‘actors’ and issues in the developing telecommunications policy process in an effort to compare policy developments in both countries.
It will seek to test the hypothesis that the unintended consequences of de-regulation in this industry may be revealing pressures for a major re-regulatory realignment between industry and government.

This research project seeks to give a critique, both historical and theoretical, of current Anglo-American versions of liberalism with their emphasis on individual rights and a purely procedural conception of liberty and equality.
These theories attempt to be neutral between rival conceptions of the good.
An insuperable difficulty, it is argued, lies in their lack of a positive notion of human fulfilment which can provide a valid set of methodological requirements for practical decisions.
Historically, this problem was best appreciated by those Idealist philosophers (eg T H Green) who sought on the basis of a theory of self-realisation to provide a moral foundation for liberal politics.
This project of revitalising the moral ground of liberalism was particularly important at a time when industrialisation had destroyed traditional sources of social cohesion by cutting individuals off from their fellow citizens and reducing their opportunities for self-expression through economic specialisation.
Individuals, denied a common conception of their own and their fellows' human goals within a shared moral tradition, are unlikely to be able to come to any agreement with others or to articulate their desire for fulfilment on the basis of procedural rules alone.
An analysis of contemporary ‘neutralist’ theories reveals that they collapse into the ethical liberalism typical of the nineteenth century.
However, it is doubtful whether this form of liberalism is viable in today's pluralist societies.
An alternative ‘political’ liberalism is proposed instead.

The project analysed relationships of accountability and representation within two forms of economic association (employers' and trade unions) as the outcome of participation in Area Manpower Boards, which advise on the planning and delivery of MSC employment and training services.
Trade union representatives saw themselves as being accountable either to their respective trade union or to the regional TUC (the nominating body), although virtually no employers' representatives saw themselves as being accountable to regional or national CBI and many were unaware they had been nominated by this body.
A strong sense of regional identity characterises the Boards and has undoubtedly assisted in breaking down the traditional divisions between capital and labour.
This has allowed a consensus style of politics to be adopted by the Area Manpower Boards as employers and employees strive to find some solutions to the socio-economic difficulties facing their regions.
At the same time, a perception exists that their efforts are being hampered through a severe lack of executive functions for the Boards.

This project aims to investigate the teaching and study of politics in British universities during the post) war period.
In particular, it concentrates upon the pedagogical role of science in the teaching of politics and the extent to which scientific language, aims and assumptions were translated and integrated into the study of politics in this period.
It is expected that the research will uncover a somewhat ad hoc reception of science into a field of study dominated by history, philosophy and law.
However, what is of importance and interest is the investigation of a process of translating scientific discourse and aims on to specific issues and problems in the teaching and study of politics.
The data base of the project is being constructed from a wide range of sources, including reports, documentation on the development of the Political Studies Association, and interviews with early members of the association.
In addition, the ‘trans) Atlantic’ college of influence, namely the influence of American political science, is being investigated and assessed.
Attention is being given to the manner in which higher education responded to the demands for a ‘hard science’ approach in education during this period of post) war reconstruction.

The project attempts to clarify and consolidate the overall body of theoretical knowledge produced by the international relations discipline.
The work is necessary because the increasing complexity of world affairs since 1945 has caused the academic literature on it to become increasingly fragmented.
Students tend to be confused by the way the subject is taught.
Formerly, most scholars studied general questions like the causes of war or the role of the United Nations.
Now they are more likely to do research on narrow topics like arms control.
In total, much more is known but it is less fully integrated.
Competing schools of thought have emerged, each interpreting international relations differently.
The research will survey the history of thought in the field, examine existing theories, and construct a new synthesis.
Emphasis will be placed on recent trends and findings in such areas as interdependence, conflict analysis and studies of how decisions are made.
These suggest a new general theory, accounting for economic, religious and ideological groups as well as states and nations.
The results should provide both a critical guide to the existing literature and a coherent framework within which to interpret it.

This project researches into the degree of cooperation between Israel and her neighbours in the management and protection of the resources of the East Mediterranean Sea; especially cooperation in the fields of marine pollution control (covered by the Barcelona Convention on the Prevention of Pollution in the Mediterranean of 1983) marine survey work, maritime traffic control, safety of life at sea and fisheries.
The Arab-Israeli field is taken as an example of the manner in which environmental and marine resource management considerations are operating to force states otherwise driven by considerations of ideology and domestic politics into relationships of confrontation punctuated by overt violent conflict, into formalised relationships involving tacit if not overt cooperation.
From this study it is hoped to develop a taxonomy of degrees of cooperation, to be applied in similar situations of long-term near-violent and sub-violent confrontations across maritime frontiers, to the fields of maritime and marine resource management and protection; such an analysis could be of guidance and advantage to policy-makers and analysts alike.
Examples of such conflict are the Baltic; the Aegean; the Black Sea; the South China Sea; the Sea of Okhotsk; the western Indian Ocean.
