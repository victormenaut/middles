Morning Mrs .
Good morning Doctor.
Well now, what can I do for you today?
I've been coming for sh three weeks now.
And I came to ask the doctor if I could get H R T. And she took my blood pressure and it was too high
She chased you.
so she didn't give me anything the first time, but she
Mhm.
The second time.
The second time, it was a different doctor again, and she gave me tablets and I can't remember the name.


It was  I just took the last one on Saturday, and I then threw the
Aye.
The wee white ones,
Aye.
Right.
Brusc something
Aye.
So
Right.
Show us your muscles.
Let's see what you're doing to your poor old self.
I don't know why I think maybe the, the tablets helped, but erm I was saying I was kind of having second thoughts whether I was wanting to go on the H R T or 
No.
No.
No chance.
No chance.
Not, not with your blood pressure up like that.
No er well she didn't say much, but she 
Well, no chance I can tell you now.
Whenever er
Just get yourself down.
And I thought er and er I had wee tablets that you gave me a while ago, Brusdeximit 
Mhm.
And I was wondering maybe if I'd be better going back on them.
Aye, you'd be safer a lot safer on them.
And they won't er they won't fight with your blood pressure.
Here just let your arm .
On second thought, it'd be .
Aye.
It's, it's amazing how many folk come up to see about it, and they, they decide eventually not to.
Doing fine.
You're fine but you'll need to stay on your wee tablets  I'm afraid.
And er I think you can forget the H R T.
I will, I felt maybe er when I came up to see, oh I was having all these heavy sweatings.
Just was it was really  
Mhm.
Mhm.
pain up  sore back, so.
And
Falling to bits.
to bits .
then I had another I had another wee problem that I'd been, I had been to see, and it was Doctor  I had been, and the doctor that I saw the last time er I had three big bruises on my back, and she 
Mhm.
says I don't know what this is.
But this was a wee sort of lump that I had down at the bottom of my vagina.
Right.
I don't know whether you would call it a lump or not, I said to her it was like a wee spot.
Mhm.
So she, she says well I don't know what that is, she says.
So I'll send you to the hospital.
So I've to go on 
Yeah.
Friday to see 
Right.
Doctor .
Right.
Now  have you got plenty of the wee tablets or are you finished?
No, I finished 'em.
Finished all that lot.
Right, Agnes.
Finished them on Saturday.
Mm  That's how I was, I was saying  had been at the hospital, come back and says no, my 
No.
tablets are finished, I'd better go to the doc 
No, you'd better.
You need to get that, need to keep that down because if you do go to the hospital, and they did decide to take that out, they would ne d they would check your blood pressure and they would chase you.
There's no way they would touch it at all.
So 
It's no, I don't really know cos the doctor says she didn't know what it was either.
Doctor  seen it first, she thought I had pulled a hair and it was kind of septic 
Septic Aye.
and she gave me tablets,
Aye, that leaves 
antibiotics.
leaves a wee cyst underneath the skin.
Is that what it would 
Mhm.
be then?
Yeah, that's probably what it is.
It it's no really er giving me any
No.
Just, no.
much trouble or anything , but it was just the fact of it being there.
It's there.
It's there.
And it's always a worry when you don't know what's going on.
And the trouble is it can turn septic again, and put the whole thing sky high again.
But s what about your  Dixevit Are you needing any more of them?
I haven't got them.
I've no I haven't 
Nothing?
been taking them

Keep some in the house in case you do get a bad spell.
Because they're s they're safe.
Would it no be similar to kept taking  Dixevit instead of the other ones Doctor ?
No.
No?
No, they wouldn't affect your
Wouldn't do anything

They're very  they're good and they have very few side effects, this is the beauty
Aha.
of the  Dixevit they keep the flushings down,

So, stick with them, if, if 
 
you're having a bad time, use them.
