The Open College of the Arts is an educational trust.
It offers practical courses in the arts and crafts to those who wish to work mainly at home, yet take advantage of professional tutorial support.
The courses consist of specially written course books taking you through a programme of work, mostly practical activity.
What Do The Courses Consist Of?
The work is to be done at home over a period of about nine months.
But you will also receive regular tutorial support, and there are optional day or summer-schools on some courses.

Who Can Enrol?
Many of our students are absolute beginners who are looking to expand their artistic interests.
Others who may already have experience take a course of the discipline and for the refreshing new ideas that it brings.
Yet others may be thinking of going on to more formal education, and treat a year with the OCA as an introduction to their particular interest.
OCA issues it's own certificate to those who require written evidence of their achievement.
Our comprehensive Guide to Courses is published in mid July.
We will gladly send you a copy if you complete the form overleaf and send it to us (no stamp needed) at OCA, Freepost, Barnsley, South Yorkshire S70 6BR.
