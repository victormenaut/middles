So what job is it you do in the factory?
Oh I get the samples, now.
I used to be a spooler, worked a machine, but I got moved to the samples about six years ago.
Aha.
Have you worked in B M K in a long while?
Er forty years.
Forty years?
Mhm.
Is this, was this your first job?
Or did you 
Yes.
?
No,I came straight here from school.
Mhm, you have a wealth of experience then.
 
So have you enjoyed working here?
Do you like it?
Yes, I liked the spooling.
Mhm.
And I like the job I've got now.
Mhm.
But er
So what d what is your job now involve, what do you do?
We cut up small pieces of carpet into different sizes and we've got about fifteen different folders
Mhm.
for each range of carpet.
We stick it on with a hot glue gun.
Mhm.
and it gets sent out to all the representatives and all the shops.
Mhm and is it basically kind of regular hours you do?
You don't do shift work?
No, we do overtime but no shift work.
Mhm, mhm.
And what first attracted you to the job?
Did you have er relatives that worked here or was it the pay or?
When I left school I had an aunt
Aha,
in the factory.
And that was basically how you got ?
Yes, yes.
Do you have a lot of friends ?
It used to be quite a custom that, you know that 
Aha.
the families just followed 
Mhm.
one another in
Mhm.
into the, the works and that, and that was how I started.
Mhm.
It's not so much like that now?
No it's not.
No it's not.
So do you have a lot of friends in B M K, you know over the years have you made any firm pals?
Oh aye, aye, you do.
Mhm.
You get attached especially at the spooling because you're working in twos.
Oh I see.
And over the years if you've been working with the same partner
Aha.
but my friend Jet is still a spooler and we still work together too.
Mhm.
Mm.
Oh aye you get to know people that you've for years and years.
Have you any nicknames for each other?
Er  no I don't think so.
Really?
I know some of them do but
Not ones that you talk about anyway.
 
Does, do, has technology affected your job?
Have they brought any, in any machines that change things?
Er  not in my job, no.
No.
No.
In other parts of the factory maybe?
Aye, but not where I work.
Not where you work.
Everything's, you, just done with your hand.
Mhm.
Aye.
Cheaper.
 
Are there no union any more?
We're in a union, oh I'm in a union.
I pay union every week but er 
Which union is it that you're in?
It'll be the  like the carpet general workers in carpet industry.
Yes, aha.
Mhm.
Aha.
But er, never have I seen  anybody for it ,
No.
I just joined it after we came over but
Mhm.
I know a lot have pulled out of it
Mhm.
Mhm.
Mm, why is that?
Do they think it's useless?
A lot do think it's useless.
Mhm, mhm.
But there again if there ever was a strike or that you've a wee bit protection.
Aha.
Mm.
So you have
What do feel about the changeover to non union and these new committees that they've now set up?
Is it a big difference or?
Oh it's  just a fact now you've just have to go and do as you're told.
Mhm.
I mean you, if you're sent to do a certain job now you've just got to go and do it.
Mhm.
Years ago that just wouldn't have been.
The idea of changing a light bulb, years ago,
Really?
I mean if it had been an electrician's job and
They had quite strong union years ago?
Oh aye, oh aye, just wouldn't have got given these jobs years ago.
Aha.
But now everybody just kind of mucks in and gets on with it.
Mhm.
So they do.
So how do you find er arrangements things do, do you think the women  are satisfied with the kind of provisions that there are made for them, the like of maternity leave and pay and things like that, health and safety?
Och I think so, aye I think they are.
It's 
Because er I mean you, they still get their maternity leave 
Mhm.
and they've got to have their job kept open for them.
Is that right?
Oh that's good, quite 
Aha, mhm, the job's got to be there for them up till twenty six weeks I think.
So you feel quite secure?
Oh I think so.
And er are there any opportunities like to come back and work part time if you've got children?
No, we don't have a lot of part-timers.
They have recently started 
 
in this factory here, they do a twilight shift.
Mhm.
I think it's at the picking.
Mhm.
But er not that factory over there, they don't.
Mhm, mhm.
Erm  so do you have a family?
Yes I've got two daughters.
And do you, how do you organize things like looking after your family will everybody muck in or 
Well they're all married, aye, they've all grown up you see.
Grown up now?
Mhm.
When you were working here did you always kind of?
When I started at first erm 
 
I just de depended on my mother.
Mhm.
Because I had some personal problems at the start and the two girls were small when I come working
Mhm.
but my mother was there.
Mhm.
And then they've grew up now.
Oh that's good.
Cos one got married in December, oh the oldest one's still in the in the house
Aha.
just having me that we manage fine.
And what do your daughters do, do they work?
Er Larine  but she's not working just now,
Mhm.
and Leigh works at the airport
Mhm.
at Prestwick.
So you wouldn't encourage them to work in, work in here?
Och it's been a good job to me.
Aha.
Mm.
I mean  and when I was a spooler I, I really enjoyed it because I had job satisfaction at the spooling,
Aha.
with nice carpets and
Aha.
it's good to know they're maybe still lying on somebody's floor.
 
Do you think there is a lot of that, people are quite proud of the work they're putting in?
Not so much now.
No.
No.
In the past?
Mhm
Mhm.
Mhm, don't have the same pride now.
Why do you think that is?
I don't know it's  I think it's now jus just a job now, you know it's 
Mhm.
just
Mhm.
specially after it was taken over I think it was
The, the kind of spirit of things is
Mhm, mhm.
Mm, so it's a big change from 
Aye.
the way it used to be?
It is, oh aye.
Do you feel it's kind of downhill?
It's er  it's still running but that's it.
Aha.
It's still a job to come to but
So do you feel that, I mean in the, in the years you've worked here is the women as important as they always were in the factory?
You know how they used to do a lot of weaving, they don't do so much now.
No there are only two women at the weaving now.
Mhm.
There used to be about, a lot of them, there used to be a whole floor, er 
Mhm.
when it was in  Street.
They were all women 
Mhm.
but we've only got two now.
Mhm.
The majority  
Er 
now working in different departments then?
the spoolers are all women.
Mhm.
And the winding is all women, they do shift work.
Mhm, do you think that women are just better suited to these jobs, is that right?women.
Well I don't know because years ago they trained er chaps to do the spooling and they were goo they were managing fine
Mhm.
they were on a night shift too then.
Mhm.
When they had the boys in.
Mhm.
And you could do it.
Mm.
But er they just don't seem to employ the boys
Aha.
to do it now.
And how about apprenticeships and things, are there any apprenticeships for women?
They've started recently, they d they didn't do it for years, we hadn't been training anybody and that was unusual because when it was the big factory you were always bringing in the school leavers
Aha.
but we've got apprentice tenters, I mean er now being trained and there's er four new spoolers
Mhm.
young girls being trained for the spool.
Mhm do you 
So that's 
feel that's, that's maybe a good thing?
Oh aye, had to be because I mean you don't stay young forever,
Mhm.
you've got have somebody 
That's right.
coming behind you that's able to do it.
That's right, aha.
It's bound to be a good thing.
And is it, I mean it used to just be men who would do these things and 
Mhm.
women maybe worked in the jobs and yet didn't have a, a piece of paper to prove
Aha.
they were only going on their reputation  
Yes.
factory .
Mhm.
Mhm.
So what do you, I mean do you get on alright with the management or do you feel that it's mostly, is the management mostly male and do you feel that er there should maybe be a wee bit more representation for the women workers in management?
Oh I suppose there could be better representation for the women because the management is all male.
Mhm, mhm.
So it is,
Mhm.
but er  
Have they not had pressure from people that would 
Mhm.
prefer  bit more er maybe more opportunities for women to go into management?
To go up into management, aha, there's nothing like that in here.
Mhm, rather than bringing people in
Mhm.
from outside.
I mean the management we've still got is the same as what we had
Mhm.
seven year ago when it was changed over, nothing's changed there so 
Mhm 
Mhm.
it's just the same.
And what happened at the changeover, did they just fire you all and then reinstate you?
They, they worked it down, and down and down, for two or three months,
Mhm.
there were always people getting paid off, and eventually out of about two hundred spooler there were only eight left
Mhm.
and that's, we, we come over here then, and that 
Mhm.
was all we had.
Two or three weavers, eight spoolers, I think it was four winders
Mhm.
er but gradually they've been building the workforce back up again,
Mhm.
it's quite healthy just now.
So where were you based before this?
Just on the other side of the river, it's been knocked 
Oh I see.
down now.
office block is, have 
aha.
you seen the big glass offi 
Aha.
that's all that's left standing, that 
Aha.
was all  B M K, right round about it.
Aha.
They had the  the winding place 
Mhm.
and the, the dye work and the spinning mill, they did their own spinning and everything.
Mhm.
They don't do that now?
No.
No.
They still do their own winding but they d they don't do their own dyeing
Mhm.
or spinning, that's bought in now.
Mhm.
Mhm.
We get told that erm in the early times there was quite a bit of social activities going on, lots of clubs and things
Mhm.
and er
film shows and things like that.
Oh years ago?
Mhm.
They used to have a photographic club, and all the sports, they had the golf and er billiards and pool and  swimming 
like that?
Swimming club, I used to go to the swimming club.
Mhm.
Did you ever win anything?
Er no .
Just for the fun.
No, just for fun.
How about the works dances?
What were they like?
Were they good?
Oh aye, yes, oh aye they were good.
Yes they were.
Big occasions?
We used to have er what they called the  Dance in summertime,
Aha.
when the boys were out with their flannels and  sports jackets and 




and girls all in their big sticky out underskirts.
Whereabouts would that be held?
They were all held in the grand hall.
Oh aha.
Mhm.
Mhm.
Er did everybody go?
Oh aye, five hundred people at a time went to them, and 
Mhm.
then we had works big ball in the wintertime, when you went with your long dress on, and your gloves, you know your .
Used to be great.

Oh aye.
All that kind of thing?
Aye, that's
Did you have like a buffet?
Yes.

I mean  went to this kind of thing, it was
Oh aye it was
awfully popular.
Mhm, mhm.
Talked about for a week afterwards?
Aye 


Oh it was a highlight, the works dance.
You don't have anything like that now?
No, no nothing, I think it's discos now.
Aha.
Er
They still have a, they hold a Christmas disco.
Do they?
Aye, but it's
Is it mostly younger ones that go to that,
No I find that usually quite a mixed crowd goes to it.
Oh that's good.
Aye they do.
So how about trips, did you go on any works trips?
Oh we used to go on the works trips, aha, we used to go to Rothesay
Rothesay?
Aye, we went on the train to Dunfermline and we used to have a lot of trips.
Was that quite a kind of regular thing?
Mhm, that was your that was your summer outing.
Aha.
Aye, we used to have a works magazine.
Aha.
In fact if I'd known I was coming here I could have brought you some in, let you seen what we used to do.

Quite a good thing.
Aye it was good.
Full of gossip?


Did you have any children's parties or things like that?
They used to have that too but they don't have that 
Mhm.

No.

Aha.
Aye.

Mhm.
and the young ones go to the Christmas party.
They were held in the canteen.
Mhm.
And er oh it used to be great fun  
And how did you raise funds for that?
It was just taken out of the welfare every week.
Mhm.
We used to pay for

Mm.

So she does, she ties them, see you come in in the morning to clock in and  and it's oh my God, it's

But she'll not let anybody by without putting something in his box.

The industry in this town used to be great but everything's shutting.
Just not there any more, you've got to go to the town now to work.
Do you think the younger generation are in a worse position than what you were in when you started work?
Aye, aye, mhm.
Oh aye, aha.
Definitely.
Do you see improvement on
I don't think so.
Maybe in the, in the, outlying districts maybe, but I think they'll have to travel to go to work.
Aye.
Mhm.
I can't see much more coming back to the town now.
Mhm, that's right.
They've just made it into a town where people are travelling out to go to work
Aye.

I can't ever see the factories coming back that used to be with, you know they're all be smaller work loads now
Aye.

I think there was eleven hundred before they started
Chopping.
Aha.
