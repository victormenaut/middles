SPORT FOR ALL AND WE MEAN IT
2 OR 102 FIT OR FAT
Disabled, Disadvantaged or Unemployed
We pride ourselves in being able to offer anyone and everyone the OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE in their chosen sport or leisure pursuit.
The only barriers to participation we put in your way are in the 100 metre hurdle event.
Harlow Sportcentre is primarily a membership centre; we have seven categories of membership:
GENERAL INFORMATION
SO HOW DO YOU PARTICIPATE?
1.
Adult (18+)
2.
Family (including all children 17 and under)
3.
Youth/Junior (10-17 inclusive)
4.
Under 10's

Membership prices vary and are also cheaper for Harlow residents (see separate tariff).
Of course, should you not wish to join for a year, day membership payment facilities will still entitle you to use all the facilities.
A subscription entitles you to entry to the Sportcentre, and to view any sport or game for which there is no separate entrance fee.
This will also entitle you to book in advance and take part in ant activities you can play individually, at an additional charge per session, enrol in a coaching group or join one of our many resident clubs.
WHAT DOES MEMBERSHIP ENTITLE YOU TO?
Membership lasts for one full year from the date you join.
HOW LONG DOES MEMBERSHIP LAST?
We offer a number of alternatives to suit individual requirements:
HOW DO YOU PAY FOR MEMBERSHIP?
1.
Cash
2.
Cheque
3.
Access/Visa
Of course if you really want to take the hassle out of membership payment and renewal, the most convenient method is by DIRECT DEBIT — your membership is guaranteed never to lapse — ask at Information for details.

Apart from the obvious benefits of being a Harlow Sportcentre member — an attractive personalised membership card being just one.
We have on your behalf negotiated discounts with certain local retail outlets — Hertz Rent a Car and Whites Garage Sawbridgeworth are just two examples.
In addition to this, every member will receive a Leisure Card which will entitle you to discounts of up to 50% on up to 350 Days Out around Great Britain.
BENEFITS PROVIDED TO MEMBERS
And of course let's not forget LEISURE LEADER, Harlow Sportcentre's own magazine — Your Magazine.
Available quarterly to every member to read and enjoy.
We even want you to submit your own articles or comments.
You may have a family but that does not mean you have to neglect your own sport and leisure pursuit.
Harlow Sportcentre welcomes everyone — including the under 5's.
CRECHE
Our purpose built well equipped creche is full of all the toys and games that children enjoy and our fully qualified and experienced staff will ensure that your child is happy and well looked after whilst you enjoy the attractions of the Sportcentre.
Full day care facilities are available on request.

With such diverse facilities and wide ranging activities, we have found that many young mothers attending the Sportcentre require a private room to feed or change the youngest member of the family — to satisfy that need we are pleased to provide a fully equipped Baby Care room to give mum the privacy and comfort she and junior deserve.
BABY CARE ROOM
