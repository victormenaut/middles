just in the corner of her mouth.
Don't force it down, just in the corner of her mouth.
She'll swallow that down nice and gently and it'll coat her tummy and it will gradually work its way through into the bowel and quieten them down as well.
Is this the medicine you're giving her?
Yes.
Yes.
Ju as long as you don't overload her.
