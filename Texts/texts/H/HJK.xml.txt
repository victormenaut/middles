Pampers and the Environment
Dear Mum,
I'm writing to you with some good news from Pampers — for your baby, and your baby's world.
Pampers are already helping to care for the environment, and now we have some important news for the future.
Recently, more and more of us have become concerned about environmental issues.
Pampers are already helping to protect the environment.
We both know that Pampers Ultra nappies are drier, but did you know that they use 30% less wood pulp and so use less trees?
And as the Ultra nappies are thinner, there's 30% less waste.
Naturally, Pampers pulp is made with care for the environment.
But Pampers haven't stopped there.
Soon we'll be helping the environment in some new ways.
We're going to: 1.
Seek ways to make nappies more biodegradable.
2.
Use recycled plastic in our nappy pack and 3.
Look at better ways to get rid of used nappies.
The enclosed environment leaflet contains all the information.
You will soon see how Pampers are caring for your baby…and your  baby's world.
And Pampers new nappies keep baby just as dry.
So please try the samples and use the £1 coupon to find out why Pampers is Britain's best selling nappy.
Best Wishes Jackie Cressey Pampers.
P.S. Pampers is also supporting the World Wide Fund for Nature in their environmental education programme.
WWF say they're delighted to work with Pampers as we continue our programme of environmental improvements.
