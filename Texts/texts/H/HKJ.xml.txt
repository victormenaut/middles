BIDWELLS
chartered surveyors Dear Mr Smith, I refer to your recent telephone conversation with my colleague, David Bateman, with regard to your interest in purchasing a strip of land 3-4 yards wide adjoining the south-eastern side of your boundary.
Land adjoining 22 High Street, Hinxton
This would reduce the size of the plot upon which Planning Consent has been obtained and as the depth of the plot is already limited, I could not, regrettably , recommend a sale of this land.
I enclose the details of No. 22 High Street, as I understand that it may be of interest to your wife's mother.
Yours sincerely, Mr. Jones
