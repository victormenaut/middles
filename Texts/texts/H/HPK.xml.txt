Gates onto the Highway
At the recent meeting of Nether Wyresdale Parish Council mention was made of the large gates onto the highway which have been erected at Burnside Snow Hill, Scorton.
Some of the councillors consider they are out of keeping with their surroundings and inappropriate in an AONB.
Could you please let me know if there are any planning or highway constraints on the size and design of gates that can be put up in this area and if planning consent is required.
I look forward to hearing from you on this matter.
Yours sincerely
Dear Sir 
I refer to your invoice dated 16/4/91 informing me that £10.58 had been debited from the above account for ‘Audit Certificate Fee’.
When I rang your bank to query this, I was told that it was for supplying information and bank statements to District Audit and that you were going to apply this to all Parish Council accounts.
I would like to make the following points:
1)
I am not happy with your practice of debiting money from the Parish Council account without any authorisation from the Council.
2)
I have taken advice on this and was told that there is no precedent for this this charge.
3)
Surely if a charge is made for this service it should be made to District Audit who, I understand, asked for the information in the first place.
4)
Please would you supply details of exactly what you sent to District Audit as, I understood I was supposed to provide details of the Parish Council bank accounts and copies of the bank statements at the audit on 7th May 91.
5)
I must ask you to look into this unwarrented charge with a view to cancelling it.
If you cannot see your way to doing this, I regret that I shall have to suggest to the Parish Council that they consider moving this account to another bank.
As the date of the audit is not far away I should appreciate an early reply.
I look forward to hearing from you.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
Planning Application 02/91/0628
The above planning application has been passed round Nether Wyresdale Parish Council excluding Councillor Collinson who declared an interest.
While the councillors felt it appropriate that the Church Hall should be put to some use they objected to the proposal for a function room and made the following points:
i)
Lack of parking provision for the extra traffic this development may be expected to generate.
ii)
The function room, especially if granted a music, singing and dancing licence, could lead to late night activity to the detriment of neighbouring residents.
iii)
A mix of flats with a function room below is not ideal.
What provision will be made for soundproofing?
iv)
What provision is to be made for access to the building?
Is this to be directly onto Snow Hill which is a narrow lane with inadequate pavements.
v)
No provision is made for access by the disabled.
vi)
Further commercial development within the village square should be restricted.
vii)
The existing problems of traffic congestion in the village will be exacerbated.
I trust you will bring the above to the attention of your committee when they meet to consider the application.
I should be grateful if you would acknowledge receipt of this letter.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
Claimed Public Footpath Snowhill Lane to Long Lane, Scorton
Thank you for your letter dated 1st May concerning the claimed public footpath from Snowhill Lane to Long Lane.
Please find enclosed letters from two members of the Parish Council who have lived in the area for many years and who have personal knowledge of the situation with regard to this route.
I understand that another local resident, Mrs M Yates has written directly to you giving her evidence about the usage of this path.
I trust this is what you require.
If you need any further information you can contact me on the above telephone number after 4 p.m. most days.
Yours sincerely,
Dear 
Footpaths
At the recent meeting of Nether Wyresdale Parish Council I was asked to draw your attention to the following footpath items:
Bridge on Ghyll Wood footpath (path no 13)
Bridge where footpath crosses Park Brook
Stile on same footpath
I understand these are all in a state of disrepair and I should be grateful if you would investigate and arrange for them to be made good.
Street Light Lower Dolphinholme
I also understand that one of the street lights in Lower Dolphinholme is burning continuously and has been like this for some time.
Please can you look into this matter.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
Please find enclosed for information a copy of my letter to Mr Callery, County Surveyor and Bridgemaster concerning footpaths in the Scorton area.

Scorton Playing Field Swings
Thank you for sending the quotation from SMP Playgrounds for supplying and installing swings.
It was considered by Nether Wyresdale Parish Council at their recent meeting but they decided not to go ahead and place an order because the prices were far too expensive.
They would still like to have some toddler swings for the playing field and as an interim measure it was suggested that one of the existing swings should be fitted with a suitable toddler seat.
I'd be interested to have your comments on this.
It was considered that Scorton with its playing field contributes to Wyre Borough's tourism policy and therefore perhaps the tourism budget should contribute towards the local facilities.
Playing Field Gates
I have also been asked to pass on the request of one of the nearby residents for the latch to be replaced on the playing field gates.
(This was a latch, not a lock we see no point in locking the gates.)
She also asked for a notice saying ‘Please close the gate’.
Yours sincerely,
|Mary Hodges
Dear 
Audit of Parish Council Accounts — Nether Wyresdale Parish Council
I am concerned that I have recently received from the National Westminster Bank an invoice for £10.58 which they have debited from the Parish Council account for ‘Audit Certificate Fee’, apparently on your instructions.
Please can you clarify this for me.
This wasn't charged when the accounts were last audited.
When I consulted the Lancashire Association of Parish & Town Councils they had never heard of such a charge being made.
I ‘m particularly concerned that the money was debited directly from the account with no authorisation from the council.
I confirm that I will bring the Parish Council accounts etc to the Council Offices Garstang at 9 a.m. on Tuesday 7th May as agreed in our recent telephone conversation.
Is it possible to arrange a different time for the accounts to be returned?
It would be more convenient for me if I could collect them on Friday 10 May in the afternoon, say at 3.30 p.m. or later rather than at 11.30 a.m.
Please could you let me know if this is all right with you.
You can contact me on Garstang (0995) 604755 after 3.30 p.m.or on Lancaster (0524) 655201 ext 2174 between 10 a.m. and 2.30 p.m.
I look forward to hearing from you.

Proposed Extensions Scorton C E School
Your letter of 26th June was discussed at the recent meeting of Nether Wyresdale Parish Council.
I am pleased to tell you that the Parish Council agreed to donate the sum of £500 towards the proposed extensions to Scorton School.
This represents the agreed contribution of £250 per year for 1990 and 1991 as outlined in my letter of 13th August 1989.
Please find enclosed a cheque for £500.
With best wishes for the success of your fund-raising efforts.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
Scorton Playing Field — Formal Request for Swings
Thank you for your letter of 28th June 1991.
Following various letters and telephone conversations with yourself and with Mr Clegg from your department, I should now like to make the following request from Wyre Borough Council Leisure Services Committee.
I would be grateful if you would ensure that this is passed to the appropriate committee.
On behalf of Nether Wyresdale Parish Council I request that the following alterations/improvements be made to the play equipment on Scorton Playing Field.
i)
A Two-seat Multi Seat Swing complete with safety ergonomic cradle seats (No MS082 in SMP catalogue 1991) be installed together with suitable safety surface meeting the appropriate British Standards.
ii)
The present set of two swings be removed and replaced with a Two-seat Multi Seat Swing with ergonomic swing seats (NO MS082 in SMP catalogue 1991).
I understand that the existing safety surface meets the relevant standard so no further safety surfacing should be required.
Yours sincerely
Dear Sir
Bus Service 23 Scorton — Garstang Thursdays
Thank you for your letter of 23rd May promising to look into the failure of Ribble to provide the above service on two occasions during May.
I have since received a letter from Ribble apologising for the inconvenience caused and promising that it would not occur again.
I have displayed this letter in the village.
However, I understand that on subsequent occasions the return bus from Garstang was not provided and on one occasion (Thursday 26th June, I believe) the bus to Garstang was not provided.
I'd be very grateful if you would investigate this.
Might I suggest that as a subsidised service has not been provided on at least five occasions, the County Council deduct an appropriate amount from their subsidy to Ribble Motor Services Ltd.
I'd also like to suggest that as a goodwill gesture and a partial recompense for the inconvenience caused to Scorton residents Ribble should offer the service free for the month of August.
I look forward to receiving your comments on this.
Yours faithfullly
Dear 
Scorton Playing Field — Formal Request for Swings
Thank you for your letter of 28th June 1991.
Following various letters and telephone conversations with yourself and with Mr Clegg from your department, I should now like to make the following request from Wyre Borough Council Leisure Services.
I should be grateful if you would ensure that this is passed to the appropriate committee for consideration.
On behalf of Nether Wyresdale Parish Council I request that the following alterations/improvements be made to the play equipment on Scorton Playing Field.
i)
A Two-seat Multi Seat Swing complete with safety ergonomic cradle seats (No MS082 in SMP catalogue 1991) be installed together with suitable safety surface meeting the appropriate British Standards.
ii)
The present set of two swings be removed and replaced with a Two-seat Multi Seat Swing with ergonomic swing seats (NO MS082 in SMP catalogue 1991).
I understand that the existing safety surface meets the relevant standard so no further safety surfacing should be required.
In support of this request I wish to make the following points:
i)
Scorton is relatively poorly provided with play equipment for young children, particularly for the under-fives.
Other parishes of similar size enjoy better provision.
ii)
Two toddler-type swings are requested as it is felt that more often than not two small children are taken to the playing field accompanied either by one or two adults and the provision of two swings would prevent disputes.
iii)
As well as the children of local residents Scorton also caters for a large number of seasonal visitors.
Many of these are families with small children.
With the current tourism promotion in this area these numbers seem set to increase.
iv)
The Parish Council itself offered to provide toddler swings but the extremely high costs for swings and safety surfaces as quoted by SMP put this way outside their budget.
The latest offer by the Parish Council to convert one of the existing swings for toddler use as an interim measure was turned down because ‘the existing equipment would not allow a conversion that would meet British Standard requirement.’
(Letter dated 28th June from Mr Eastham.)
v)
I understand that Wyre Borough Council are standardising all the play equipment throughout the borough and bringing it up to British Standards safety requirements.
This seems an ideal opportunity to improve the play provision on Scorton playing field and at the same time bring it into line with the rest of the borough.
vi)
In my letter of 1st August 1990 I mentioned the request of the Parish Council ‘for an extra swing of a kind that is suitable for toddlers, i.e. one with a rail round it to stop the child falling off the seat.’
I asked for this to be brought ‘to the attention of the appropriate committee’.
Apparently this was not done.
vii)
Please give the above your serious consideration and authorise the improvements to Scorton playing field equipment either as part of the Capital Programme or as an addition to the on-going refurbishment of playing fields which is now in progress in the borough.
viii)
Please could you also ensure that the delay in making this request does not mean that the work is excessively held back.
I trust you will pass this to the appropriate committee and look forward to their comments.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
Hedges Trough Road and Gubberford Lane
Following the recent meeting of Nether Wyresdale Parish Council I have been asked to write to your about the hedges on your property on Trough Road opposite Wyresdale Crescent and also on Gubberford Lane between the river bridge and the first bend.
Both sets of hedges are getting very overgrown and make it very difficult for pedestrians who are forced out into the middle of the road with the consequent danger from traffic.
There is the judging of the village for the Britain in Bloom competition to take place shortly and Scorton is also entered in the Best Kept Village Competition.
So please could you arrange to have the hedges trimmed back as soon as convenient.
As a cyclist myself, I should like to make a personal request: if you should find it necessary to use a tractor-mounted flail hedge trimmer to cut the hedges please could you ensure that the hawthorn clippings are swept up and removed and not left in the road as a danger to cyclists.
Many thanks.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
Highway Matters — Nether Wyresdale
At their recent meeting Nether Wyresdale Parish Council asked me to write to you about the following:
i)
Grass verges: some of the grass verges on the roads leading into the village, particularly Station Lane are getting very overgrown.
Scorton has entered both the Britain in Bloom and the Best Kept Village competitions and the Parish Council would be grateful if you could see your way to getting the verges trimmed as soon as possible.
I understand the judging for the Britain in Bloom is on 10th July.
ii)
Tithe Barn Lane — reinstatement of surface: In your letter dated 7th November 1990 you said that the carriageway ‘will be reinstated as soon as possible after the removal of the stump’(of the fallen tree).
The tree has been removed some time since.
The road surface has not been reinstated.
iii)
Footway beside Flood Bank, Gubberford Lane: In a letter dated 24th May 1990 you said that this area of loose stone would be tarmacadamed ‘in the near future’!
It is still in its previous state.
I trust you will look into all the above matters.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
Land Adjacent Wyresdale Crescent, Scorton
At the recent meeting of Nether Wyresdale Parish Council attention was drawn to the Minutes of Wyre Borough Council Land and Properties Sub-committee LP7 in respect of the above land.
I have been asked to write to restate the views of the Parish Council about this matter.
They consider the site forms a welcome natural break between the conservation area and the non-conservation area and further development there should be resisted on grounds of visual amenity.
The Parish Council would welcome the opportunity to be involved in the discussions on the future of the site.
I should be grateful if you would acknowledge receipt of this letter.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
Footpaths — Nether Wyresdale
Following the recent meeting of Nether Wyresdale Parish Council I have been asked to draw your attention to the following:
Footpath 11 There is a sign where this path leaves Gubberford Lane (Grid Ref SD 502 486) marking it as a footpath, but the path leads straight into the river!
I understand at one time it was possible to cross the river by means of stepping stones but these are no longer in position and the landowner finds that walkers wander along the river bank looking for the path and for a way to cross the river.
Please can you look into this and see what can be done.
Obviously it is strangers to the area who are misled by this sign but we do have a large number of visitors to Scorton who enjoy walking the paths.
Perhaps the notice could be altered to indicate that the path leads only as far as the river.
Footpath 18 Grid Ref SD 508 514.
I understand that a bridge over a stream on this footpath and also a gate are in a very poor state of repair.
Again, please can you look at the situation and see what can be done.
Yours sincerely
Dear Sirs:

Hedges Trough Road and Gubberford Lane
Thank you for your prompt reply to my letter about the hedges on Trough Road and Gubberford Lane.
I wish I could tell you when the inspection for the Best Kept Village is to take place, but I'm afraid it's a well kept secret!
All I can find out from the organisers is that ‘preliminary judging will take place between 1st June and 14th July and final judging will be completed in August and results announced in early September’.
On the matter of hedge cutting debris could I ask you please to ensure that your contractor removes the hedge clippings and does not leave them where they will cause a hazard to cyclists.
Many thanks
Yours sincerely
Dear 
Bus Service 23 Scorton — Garstang Thursdays
Thank you for your letter of 5th July about the above subsidised bus service.
I've enquired of the regular users of this service and they tell me that on the following days the advertised journeys did not take place:
Thursday 9th May — Scorton — Garstang bus did not arrive
Thursday 16th May — Garstang — Scorton bus did not operate.
Thursday 27th June — Scorton — Garstang bus did not arrive
There may be other occasions but these three are vouched for by several different would-be passengers.
I'm particularly concerned about the lack of the service on 27th June as I received a letter from Mr J L Gould of Ribble dated 3 June saying the errors in their scheduling had been rectified.
I'd be grateful if you could look into this matter and I shall see that the phone number of the County Transport Enquiry Line is displayed in the village.
Your sincerely
Dear 
Planning Application No 02/91/0992 New Entrance Gates, Burnside, Snow Hill, Scorton
The above planning application has been passed round the Parish Council for comments and the majority of councillors are opposed to this development.
They consider the gates are too large and out of keeping with the character of the area.
Other residents have also expressed concern about the visual impact of these gates and the materials used in their construction.
I trust you will bring the above comments to the attention of your committee when they meet to discuss the application.
I should be grateful if you would acknowledge receipt of this letter.

Use of School Premises — Parish Council Meeting
Please find enclosed an application, for the use of a classroom in C. E. School for a Parish Council Meeting on Thursday 26th September 1991 starting at 7.30 p.m.
I should also mention that the Parish Council meeting held on Thursday 15th August 1991 (Approval 294) lasted from 7.30 p.m. to 8.30 p.m. only.
I trust the above is in order.

Dear 
Thank you for your letter of 16th July about your proposed dissertation.
It has been passed round the parish councillors for any information or comments.
Councillor Bernard Gornall of Maylin, Station Lane, Scorton PR3 1AP adds the following:’ Our local historian Mr W G Richmond would no doubt be willing to assist.
I have some limited sale documents dating back to the 1920's when the Wyresdale Estate was broken up and properties sold.
I also have a few old postcards if these are of any use.’
As I think I mentioned on the phone posssible sources of information that I would suggest are:
i)
Mr Richmond of Kettlewell, The Square, Scorton (the ‘local historian’ mentioned above) He has lived all his life in Scorton and knows more about the village than anyone else I can think of.
ii)
The recent survey carried out by St Peter's C of E Church.
This was sent to every house not just to members of St Peter's church and dealt with general social topics e.g. place of work, type of work, size of household etc.
Much of the research was done by Mr Jim Fisher of 19 The Square Scorton.
Again, I'm sure he'd be pleased to help you.
iii)
Mr Thomas Moss of Sundial Cottage The Square, Scorton might also be able to give you some useful information.
He was born in the village and has written a short history of Scorton.
iv)
Another possibility is Miss Winifred Robinson of Windy Ridge Snow Hill Lane, Scorton.
She was a schoolteacher at the village school and has written a book about Scorton called, I think, ‘Straws in the Wind’.
I hope this is of some use to you.
With best wishes for the success of your dissertation,
Yours sincerely

Street Lighting
I have been asked to draw your attention to the following street lights in Nether Wyresdale Parish which are permanently obscured by the foliage of overhanging trees: i) A light on the north side of Station Lane Scorton outside Abbots House ii) a light under the archway leading to Scorton Hall Park opposite The Lodge and iii) a light on Gubberford Lane near the public toilets.
I understand that all these come within the definition of ‘highway lighting’ as opposed to‘footway lighting’as given to me by one of your officers and are therefore the responsibility of Lancashire County Council.
However, I am also writing to Wyre Borough Council in case they have any responsibility for maintaining these lights.
Please could you look into this and see what can be done to make the lights visible again.
Thank you for your help.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
Street Lighting Scorton
I have been asked to draw your attention to the following street lights in Scorton which are permanently obscured by the foliage of overhanging trees:
i)
a light on the north side of Station Lane Scorton outside Abbots House
ii)
a light under the archway leading to Scorton Hall Park opposite The Lodge and
iii)
a light on Gubberford Lane near the public toilets.
I understand these are all technically ‘highway’ rather than‘footway’lights and are therefore the responsibility of Lancashire County Council and I have written to L.C.C.
Highways Department.
However, in case my assumption is incorrect I am also informing your department.
Please could you look into the matter and see what can be done to make the lights visible again.
Thank you for your help.

Dear Sir:
LCC Subsidised Bus Service Scorton — Garstang
I have been asked to draw your attention to the non-arrival of the Scorton to Garstang bus on Thursday 9th May and on Thursday 16th May.
I understand this is one of the LCC subsidised services and hope that you will take the matter up with Ribble and ensure that this doesn't occur again
I'd like to make the following points:
i)
This service is used mainly by the elderly who have no access to alternative forms of transport.
ii)
Most of them are not able to manage the walk of over a mile to the A6 to catch the Lancaster- Preston bus
iii)
In some cases doctor's dentist's or other appointments will have been made for the Thursdays when the bus failed to arrive.
iv)
This is not a case of waiting half and hour — the next bus is a week later!
v)
Ribble's failure to provide the service paid for will have caused inconvenience, and distress to elderly residents of Scorton and perhaps involved them in the extra cost of missed appointments or expensive taxi fares.
Could I suggest you ask Ribble to send a letter of explanation and apology to the people concerned.
(If it is addressed to myself as Parish Clerk I will see that it is displayed prominently in the village.)
I would also suggest that any future cancellations be notified either by a poster in the village or by a phone call to the village post office, so would-be passengers can make alternative arrangements.
Could I also express my satisfaction and that of other residents with the service provided by Mr Curwen's taxi-bus on school days.
Unlike the Ribble bus it has never let us down!
Yours faithfullly

Cleaning of Scorton War Memorial
In a recent telephone conversation you told me that your department would include the War Memorial in Scorton under your grounds maintenance scheme and that this would include the cleaning of the actual memorial cross itself.
You asked me to send a reminder so you could arrange for the stone cross to be cleaned before Remembrance Sunday in November.
I'd be very grateful if you could arrange for this work to be carried out.

Dear 
Hedge-cutting Gubberford Lane and Trough Road
At the recent meeting of Nether Wyresdale Parish Council concern was expressed about the state of the hedges on your property on both sides of Trough Road near Wyresdale Crescent and on Gubberford Lane between the river bridge and the first bend.
The hedges are very overgrown and pedestrians are forced into the middle of the road with the consequent danger from traffic.
I have, therefore, been asked to repeat my request of 3 July asking you to arrange for the hedges to be trimmed as soon as possible.
I should also like to add a personal request as a cyclist and ask you to ensure that the debris from the hedge cutting is not left on the highway where it can cause a hazard to cyclists.
Many thanks for your help in this matter.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
Accident Wagon Road Lower Dolphinholme
At the latest meeting of Nether Wyresdale Parish Council attention was drawn to a recent accident in Lower Dolphinholme when a child was knocked off his bicycle by a car which failed to stop.
At the site of the accident Pan Gulf developers have erected a large hoarding which obscures the view of the road for oncoming traffic and almost opposite a local resident has placed large stones on the grass verge to prevent vehicles encroaching onto his property.
It was felt that both these circumstances may have contributed to the accident.
I have been asked to write to you on this matter because this hazard was drawn to your attention in my letter of 18th April 1991 following the Annual Parish Meeting.
The Parish Council would be grateful if you could investigate this problem and see what action can be taken to prevent any further accidents at this spot.
On a similar matter a local resident mentioned that the owners of the property known as Rivendell have, in effect, extended their garden by planting shrubs etc on the grass verge thus making it impossible for either vehicles or pedestrians to use this as a refuge in an emergency.
Rivendell is approximately 200 metres South East from Street crossroads on the South side of the road at Grid Ref SD 523 519.
I should be grateful if you would let me know what action you take on the above matters.
I have been asked to send a copy of this letter to the local police station dealing with the accident.
As requested by the Parish Council I enclose a copy of a recent letter to a local landowner which, I think, is self-explanatory.
Yours sincerely

Dear 
Garstang Magistrates' Court
I understand that there is to be a meeting on Tuesday next to decide whether or not to close Garstang Magistrates Court.
Nether Wyresdale Parish Council have asked me to express their strong objection to the proposed closure and to urge you to do all in your power to prevent it.
Among the points made were the following:
i)
If the court is closed all cases will be heard at Fleetwood.
This is a long distance from the rural areas of Wyre and there would be substantial costs in time and money for magistrates, witnesses and police making the journey to Fleetwood.
ii)
The journey is especially difficult for those without their own transport and would impose extra expense on those least able to afford it.
iii)
The road to Fleetwood is not one of the best and any extra traffic must bring extra problems.
iv)
Police time and manpower will be taken up with travelling to the court and the number of officers available for ordinary police duties will be reduced during court sittings.
iv)
This closure is seen as a loss of an amenity for the rural areas around Garstang.
I hope you will take note of the wishes of your constituents and do all you can to see that Garstang retains its Magistrates' Court.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
Garstang Magistrates Court
I had a letter from LAPTC yesterday about the threatened closure of Garstang Magistrates' Court.
They suggested that any objections should be sent to our County Councillor immediately as there is a meeting arranged for next Tuesday to decide whether or not to close the court.
I contacted all the Parish Councillors I could and they were all agreed in opposing the closure.
I've sent a letter to County Councillor Ward to this effect.
Bulbs
At the last Parish Council meeting it was agreed to buy some bulbs for planting around the centre of the village.
These have now arrived and there is to be a bulb planting session on Saturday next 19th October starting at 10 a.m.
Assemble outside the Priory Stores.Bulbs provided but please bring your own planting tools.
All assistance gratefully received!

Thank you for your letter of 2nd November about Nether Wyresdale's remaining share of Wyre Borough Lottery Fund.
This money (£89.99) is available for sporting or recreational uses in the parish and I'm pleased to tell you that at their recent meeting the Parish Council agreed that it should be passed to Scorton Bowling Club.
Please find enclosed a cheque for £90.
I understand that it will be used towards the purchase of floodlights for the bowling green.
I'd be grateful if you'd let me have a receipt for the Parish Council records.

Dear Sirs:
Claimed Public Footpath Snow Hill — Long Lane Scorton
Lancashire County Council have notified Nether Wyresdale Parish Council of the rejection of your application to have the footpath from Snow Hill to Long Lane Scorton declared a public right of way (Claim No 804/126).
At their recent meeting the parish council asked me to find out whether the Ramblers' Association is contemplating appealing against this decision.
If so, they would be prepared to supply further evidence of use of the path over a number of years.
Yours faithfullly
Dear 
I have been asked to draw your attention to the following highway matters in Nether Wyresdale Parish:
i)
The signpost at Gubberford Bridge has been knocked over and is lying on the ground.
ii)
The edge of the road near the bowling green where a tree blew down is still not reinstated or fenced.
I have a letter from Mr C J Whalley, Divisional Surveyor dated 7th November 1990 saying that the carriageway would be reinstated as soon as possible after the removal of the tree stump.
A further letter dated 9th July 1991 says that orders have been placed with your Direct Labour Organisation to carry out this work.
It is still outstanding and there are cables and wires lying on the surface making it both unsightly and possibly hazardous.
Please can you look into this.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
Public Rights of Way in need of clearing
Thank you for your recent letter concerning public rights of way to be listed in your programme for cutting each year.
I've brought this matter before the Parish Council and displayed a notice asking local residents to identify any such paths.
I enclose some of your forms completed to the best of my ability from information given by parish councillors.
I hope they are useful to your officers when compiling the list.
At the recent Parish Council meeting there was a request from a local resident that the bridle way leaving the Trough Road opposite the entrance to Salisbury Farm (Grid Ref SD 522 511) which was stopped when the gas pipe line was laid should be reopened.
Please can you look into this.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
Street Light Station Lane Scorton
At the recent meeting of Nether Wyresdale Parish Council the street light outside Annfield, Station Lane, Scorton was mentioned as not working.
I understand this section — between the end of Brook Avenue and the railway bridge comes under your control as ‘footway’ lighting.
Please can you look into this and arrange for it to be repaired.
Many thanks.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
Planning Application 02/91/1574 Use of Church Hall as Function Room for Restaurant
The above planning application has been passed round the parish councillors (excluding the applicant, Councillor Collinson) for comments.
There was unanimous agreement that this application should be refused.
The following points were made:
i)
This application repeats part of application 02/91/0628 which was refused by Wyre Borough Council.
The reasons for refusal as set out in Wyre Borough Council Minutes dated 14/11/91 page 65 are equally applicable to the present application.
ii)
Most of the comments contained in my letter of 25 May 1991 on the previous application still apply.
iii)
A function room, especially if granted a licence for music, singing and dancing could lead to late night activity and noise to the detriment of neighbouring residents.
iv)
It was felt that further commercial development in the village square should be restricted.
v)
If this development is allowed to go ahead it will exacerbate the already serious parking problems in the village.
vi)
The response to question 19 says that staff cars will be able to park at the rear of the post office and thus free parking spaces for visitors to the function room.
This was questioned by members of the parish council; if the area behind the post office is to be used for staff parking, should not a separate planning application to this effect be made?
As you will be aware the area to the rear of the post office was part of a previous application (02/86/0554) for use as a car park.
This was refused by Wyre Borough Council and a subsequent appeal to the D.O.E.
was dismissed.
Please note the report of the D.O.E.
inspector Ref APP/U2370/A/88/103680) especially paragraph 5 dealing with the effect on residential amenities of the properties 19 — 24 The Square.
If the parking of staff cars is allowed it was felt a precedent would be created and the parking of customers' cars would then be a natural progression.
I trust you will bring the above to the attention of your committee when they meet to consider the application.
I should be grateful if you would acknowledge the receipt of this letter.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
Street Lighting
I have been asked to draw your attention to the following street lights in Nether Wyresdale Parish which are permanently obscured by the foliage of overhanging trees: i) A light on the north side of Station Lane Scorton outside Abbots House ii) a light under the archway leading to Scorton Hall Park opposite The Lodge and iii) a light on Gubberford Lane near the public toilets.
I understand that all these come within the definition of ‘highway lighting’ as opposed to‘footway lighting’as given to me by one of your officers and are therefore the responsibility of Lancashire County Council.
However, I am also writing to Wyre Borough Council in case they have any responsibility for maintaining these lights.
Please could you look into this and see what can be done to make the lights visible again.
Thank you for your help.
Yours sincerely
Dear Sir:
Account 04922182 Nether Wyresdale Parish Council
I have received your letter dated 24th January 1992 suggesting certain changes to the Parish Council Bank Account.
As I am unable to call to discuss these with you in person during bank opening hours I should be grateful for a reply in writing which I can present to the Council at their next meeting on 2 April 1992.
I do not consider the ‘Small Business Account’ is appropriate for the Parish Council.
The Council is not a ‘business’ in the usual sense of the word i.e. it does not trade or make a profit and it will not require many of the services normally provided by a bank for a small business e.g. loans, overdrafts, inpayments of large sums of cash in coin etc.
Please would you therefore let me have full details of what other types of accounts you are prepared to undertake, how any charges are calculated and what interest is paid.
Here is a summary of the service we receive from your bank at present, based on an agreement reached with the manager shortly after I took over as clerk to the Parish Council:
Account 04922182 — Nether Wyresdale Parish Council
A current and a deposit account with the same account number.
Cheques drawn on the current account, cheque signatories any two of three named councillors.
A balance of £20 is kept in the current account and the remainder in the deposit account.
When cheques are cashed a transfer is automatically made from the deposit account to meet the payment and make up the current account to £20.
This is done by the bank.
Bank statements are supplied once a quarter for both accounts.
Interest on the deposit account is paid into the account at the end of June and the end of December.
No charges are made for any of the above.
This is a relatively small account and involves on average 3 inpayments per year and fewer than 20 cheques are written per year.
It has never been in the red!
An Audit Certification Fee of £10.58 was charged on 16 April 1991.
Apart from this final item — a charge which District Audit assure me is not made by most other banks and which was not made by yourselves in previous years — I have been very happy with the standard of service provided by Natwest Bank.
As any changes to the Parish Council's bank accounts must be authorised by the Parish Councillors I would ask you to continue the present arrangement until they have had a chance to discuss any alterations you might suggest.
This will be at their next meeting on 2 April 1992.
This will have the advantage of coming at the beginning of a new financial year.
(As far as I can see there will be no further cheques drawn on the account or inpayments made between 9th March and 2nd April.)
I look forward to hearing from you and trust you will agree either to continue our present arrangements or propose some suitable alternative.
I should be sorry to have to advise the Parish Council to look elsewhere for banking services.
Yours faithfullly
Dear 
Land Adjacent Wyresdale Crescent, Scorton
I have been asked to write to you to express the grave concern of Nether Wyresdale Parish Council about the proposed sale of the piece of land adjacent to Wyresdale Crescent Scorton by Wyre Borough Council Land and Properties Sub-Committee.
As I understand it, this is the situation:
1.
Application 02/91/0180 for a residential development on this land was made by the Land and Properties Sub-Committee, and turned down by the Planning Committee on 4th April 1991.
2.
The reason given for refusal was ‘The proposed development would be in a prominent location within Scorton, and its construction would be unduly obtrusive in the street picture and detrimental to the character and appearance of both the Scorton Conservation Area and the Forest of Bowland AONB’(See council minutes PL113)
3.
The Parish Council were strongly opposed to this development and a letter was sent to the planning officer stating their views.
This was not passed on to the planning committee.
I understand that the report to the planning committee claimed the Parish Council had no objections.
4.
I wrote to the planning officer on 10 April 1991 enclosing a copy of my earlier letter, and again on 6 July 1991 when the matter was raised in the Minutes of the Land and Properties Sub-Committee, restating the Parish Council's views and asking that they should be involved in the discussions of the future of the site.
This request was ignored.
5.
The matter was raised in the meeting of the Land and Properties Sub-Committee 14 January 1992 (LP 4) where it was resolved to offer the land for sale by open tender on condition that the purchaser submits a detailed planning application for one detached dwelling based on plans already drawn up and agreed by the planning officer as acceptable.
These plans were not sent to the Parish Council or the local residents for comment.
The Parish Council are very disturbed by the decisions that would appear to have been made about the sale and subsequent development of this small area of open land and more especially by the tactics used by the Land and Properties Sub-Committee and the apparent collusion with the Planning Department to keep the Parish Council, and therefore the local people, in the dark about what is going on.
I should be grateful if you would investigate this as a matter of importance and urgency and let me know your findings.
Our next Parish Council meeting is on 2 April 1992 and it would be appreciated if I could have your reply before that date.
I enclose copies of my various letters to the Planning Officer relating to this matter.
Yours sincerely
Dear Sirs:
Paper on Reorganisation of Local Government
Thank you for sending the parish council a copy of the paper on local government reorganisation.
Following their recent meeting these are their comments:
i)
They would like to see the present role of parish councils retained and enhanced.
ii)
Parish councils should have greater say especially in planning matters.
iii)
It was suggested that parish councils should have the right to have their written comments on planning matters put before the planning committees in full.
At present it is left to the planning officers of the district council to decide how the views of parish councils are pesented to the planning committee or indeed if they are presented at all.
Yours faithfullly
Dear 
Parish Council Skip Provision
Thank you for your letter of 27 January about the provision of a rural skip service for Parish Councils.
Following my recent conversation with Mr Dever I confirm that Nether Wyresdale Parish Council should like to take advantage of this service during the financial year 1992/93.
I understand that Mr Dever has provisionally arranged for a skip to be provided in Scorton from 31 March — 7 April.
I will await confirmation of these dates before I contact the owner of the site or arrange local publicity.
I look forward to hearing from you.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
Abandoned Car
I have been asked to draw the attention of Wyre Borough Council to a burnt out car which I understand has been abandoned off the road near the reservoir on Nicky Nook, Scorton.
As I am unsure which department of the Borough Council would have responsibility for a matter like this I am addressing my letter to you and trust that you will pass it on to the appropriate office.
I hope you will be able to arrange for the removal and disposal of this vehicle or if not perhaps you would let me know who can.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
Extension of 30 mph Speed Limit Gubberford Lane Scorton
At the recent meeting of Nether Wyresdale Parish Council a request was made by local residents for the 30 mph speed limit in village to be extended to the section of Gubberford Lane beyond the railway bridge to take in the group of dwellings ending with Woodlands.
In support of this request I should like to make the following points:
i)
This section of the road is continuously built up on one side and contains ten residential access points.
I understand that other roads built up on one side only have been granted 30 mph speed limits.
iii)
Gubberford Lane takes a heavy volume of traffic throughout the week.
At weekends it is very busy with visitors' cars and coaches.
iv)
The road is used by numbers of walkers and cyclists.
v)
For most of the length there is no footpath and no way for a pedestrian to avoid oncoming vehicles.
Repeated requests from local residents for a footpath have met with no success.
vi)
There have been numerous accidents and near-misses on the blind bends.
vii)
The railway bridge can take only one vehicle at a time and obscures visibility.
There is often headlamp glass in the road nearby.
viii)
An extended speed limit would go a long way towards making this road safer for all users and would be relatively inexpensive.
Please give this matter your serious consideration
Yours sincerely
Dear 
Thank you for your letter of 25th January.
I will put this on the Agenda for the next meeting of Nether Wyresdale Parish Council.
This will be on Thursday 2 April in the school following the Annual Parish Meeting which will begin at 7.30 p.m.
I'm sure the parish councillors will be interested in discussing the matters raised in your letter.
Yours sincerely
Dear Sirs
Wyre Barrage Feasibility Study
I understand that a copy of the Wyre Barrage Feasibility Study is available from your organisation.
Nether Wyresdale Parish Council have received a summary of the report but I have been asked to obtain a copy of the complete report.
I don't know whether there is a charge for this; if there is, please would you let me know before sending the report as all expenditure has to be authorised by a meeting of the Parish Council.
I look forward to hearing from you.
Yours faithfullly
Dear 
Application 02/92/0065
The above-numbered planning application has been passed round Nether Wyresdale Parish Council for comments.
There are no objections.

Dear Sir:
Provision of Banking Services to the Parish Council
I am reviewing the banking arrangements of the Parish Council with a view to obtaining better conditions.
The services required are set out below.
If you would like to provide banking services to Nether Wyresdale Parish Council would you please send me details and terms by 15th March so that I can report to the meeting of the Parish Council on 2nd April 1992.
The decision will be in the hands of the councillors.
Services Required
1.
An account with cheque book facilities.
Cheques to be signed by two councillors out of not more than four approved signatories.
2.
Interest on credit balance either in the cheque account or in an associated deposit account.
If interest is earned in a separate account from the cheque account I would expect automatic transfers to keep the cheque account at an agreed limit.
3.
Quarterly bank statements
4.
Return of paid cheques (Auditors' Requirement)
5.
An Audit Certificate annually on request of District Audit
Quantities
Balance — normally between £500 and £2000.
Inpayments — normally less than 4 transactions per year — all cheques
Withdrawals — normally less than 20 per year — all cheques.
I look forward to hearing from you.
Yours faithfullly
Dear 
Temporary Road Closure — Station Lane Scorton
Thank you for your letter of 10th February concerning the temporary closure of Station Lane.
I note that pedestrians and, I assume, pedal cyclists pushing their bikes will be able to use the road during the closure and that access will be available to property.
Please could you ensure that this is made clear on any notices that are put up and that the contractors doing the work are also aware that pedestrians, cyclists and people requiring access to property are to be allowed through.
I would not like to see a repeat of the problems caused when Station Lane was closed at the railway bridge some time ago!
The ‘alternative route’ as outlined in your letter contains some mistakes and would be very confusing for anyone who didn't know the area.
Your letter says ‘bus services are not affected’.
I wonder if you are aware that there is a Lancashire County Council minibus service that uses this stretch of the road twice daily on schooldays.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
Road Closure Station Lane, Scorton
Thank you for your letter of 20th February regarding the forthcoming road closure of Station Lane.
I have also received a copy of the Public Notice from Lancashire County Council and I note that this refers only to ‘motor vehicles’.
On a previous occasion when Station Lane was closed to vehicles there were problems because the contractors refused to allow pedal cycles to proceed.
I should mention that the alternative route for people travelling northwards from Scorton or for children cycling to the village school would involve a three-mile detour along the busy A6 which is not acceptable for schoolchildren and old ladies.
Please would you therefore confirm in writing that cyclists, if necessary pushing their bikes, are to be treated as pedestrians and allowed to proceed.
I look forward to receiving a reply by return of post.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
Planning Application 02/92/0124 Agricultural Worker's Dwelling — Land Rear of Bryn Mor Long Lane, Scorton
The above planning application has been passed round the Parish Council for comments.
The application is virtually identical to application 02/91/1443 which was refused.
The majority of the Parish Council see no reason for the planning authority to alter their decision and have asked me to re-state the comments made in my letter of 18 November 1991 (Ref WBCP/22/1811).
The proposed development is contrary to the stated policy of the local planning authority where new dwellings in the countryside are normally resisted unless they can be shown to be justified by agricultural need.
It was felt that the application does not fall within the Structure Plan and to allow it would create a precedent and make other similar applications difficult to refuse.
For these reasons the majority of the Parish Council are opposed to this development.
I trust you will pass their comments to the planning committee when they meet to consider this application.
I should be grateful if you would acknowledge receipt of this letter.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
Questionnaire
I am pleased to have the chance to complete the enclosed questionnaire and let you know what I think of the NatWest bank and why I am less than satisfied with the service received.
Because of the peculiar restricted hours that banks open I am unable to visit the branch where the account is held and any over-the-counter transactions — usually only 2 per year — have to be made at another branch.
I am also unable to telephone the bank manager during working hours.
Until 1991 the Parish Council had a reasonably good arrangement with the NatWest bank with a small current account being topped up as necessary from an interest-earning deposit account, an arrangement made several years ago when I first became Parish Council clerk.
Last year for the first time we were charged £10.58 for an audit certificate — something District Audit assure me takes a few minutes to complete and is provided free of charge by most banks.
What I found particularly worrying was that the money was debited from the account without even informing me.
The actual charge was £10.58, but, as I understand it, the branch manager is free to charge whatever sum he wishes.
A very unsatisfactory way to conduct business.
How can anyone possibly budget to make the best use of the chargepayers' money if unspecified amounts are to be taken from the Parish Council account by the bank?
Since then I have had i) a circular letter dated December 1991 with a copy of your code of practice for business banking plus details of charges to business customers.
ii) duplicated letter dated 24th January 1992 giving revised account charging terms which are very disadvantageous to the Parish Council.
These were so extreme that I was sure some office junior had filled the form in wrongly!
In the financial year 1990/91 the Parish Council received bank interest to a total of £53.87.
If the new rates had applied to that year they would have wiped out the interest and still left £5.67 to pay!
In other words we would have been better off cashing the precept and keeping the money under the mattress.
A letter to the branch manager only produced a restatement of the charging terms.
He seems totally inflexible and unwilling to negotiate any variation of the arrangements proposed and can't appreciate that the banking needs of a parish council are not the same as those of a sweet shop!
I find it difficult to believe that a bank like the NatWest can't offer any more appropriate type of account than this ‘small business account’
I know that a number of small clubs and societies in the area are also very perturbed about the highhanded way NatWest has dealt with the matter of classifying them as ‘small business’ accounts.
If their treasurers haven't yet written to you it may well be because they are busy shopping around for alternative banking services — as indeed I am.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
Use of Mill Yard for Skip
Last year you were kind enough to allow a skip to be placed in the Mill Yard for the collection of large items of household rubbish.
I'm writing to ask if it would be possible to repeat the exercise this year.
As before, Lancashire County Council Waste Disposal Department will provide the skip and replace it as necessary.
The only difference is that they now want to leave the skip on site for a week at a time.
The dates they have provisionally chosen for Scorton are Tuesday 31 March — Tuesday 7 April.
All the other details would be the same as last year.
Please could you let me know as soon as possible if you agree to this and then I can go ahead with the arrangements.
An answer by return would be appreciated but a phone call will do; you can contact me on Garstang (0995) 604755 after 5 p.m. most evenings.
Many thanks in anticipation of your help.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
The next meeting of Nether Wyresdale Parish Council is on Thursday 21 January at 7.30 in the C E School.
(Same day and time as WBC meeting with Parish & Town Councils).
Nevertheless, I hope you are able to come.

Dear 
St Peter's Church Magazine — Next Issue
Please could you publicise the following in the next issue:
Rubbish Skip
There will be a skip available in the Mill Yard from Tuesday 31st March — Tuesday 7th April for bulky items of household refuse — but no trade refuse, please.
Now's the chance to clear out attics and sheds and get rid of old carpets, broken furniture etc. a
Litter Pick
A litter pick will take place round the village and surrounding area on Saturday 4 April starting from the Mill Yard at 10 a.m.
Volunteers needed, bin bags and picking sticks provided.
Annual Parish Meeting
Thursday 2nd April in the school at 7.30 p.m.
All residents of the parish welcome to come along and raise any matters of local interest.

Planning Application 02/92/0237

Dear 
Planning Application No 02/92/0233
Thank you for sending a copy of the above planning application.
It has been passed round the members of Nether Wyresdale Parish Council for their comments.
The majority of Parish Councillors had no objections to this development.
But they were not clear about what exactly is being applied for.
Is it a residential dwelling or an office?
I'd be grateful if you could clarify this.
Yours sincerely

Bank Accounts — Nether Wyresdale Parish Council
At their recent meeting the Parish Council agreed to move their bank accounts to TSB Bank, Garstang.
We would like to open a TSB Interest Cheque account and also a Flexible Savings Account and authorise the Clerk to the Parish Council, to transfer money on our behalf between these accounts in person, in writing or by phone.

Dear 
Dog Byelaws
Thank you for your letter of 12th March.
I enclose the official byelaw in respect of Nether Wyresdale duly signed by myself on behalf of the Parish Council as instructed.
In your letter of 14th October 1991 Appendix A (4) Scorton (Sports Field, Children's play area) is listed as informal submission ‘BAN’ and under ‘Home Office Response’is ‘AGREE’.
However I notice that Wyre Borough Council workmen are now fencing off the area immediately around the swings etc.
Does this mean that only this small area is to be subject to the prohibition?
Please could you clarify this matter.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
The various points raised in your letter of 25 January were discussed at the recent meeting of Nether Wyresdale Parish Council.
Housing Needs Survey Proposed Joint Meeting
In May 1990 the Parish Council arranged a talk by Mrs Wendy Lee to consider the possibility of a survey to identify a need for low-cost housing.
There was no enthusiasm at that time from local residents for such a project, nor was any land available for such housing and it was agreed to take no further action on this.
The Parish Council, therefore, consider that there would be little point in a joint meeting with the Parochial Church Council as suggested.
However, I should mention that all Parish Council meetings are open to the public and you or any member of the PCC may attend and speak during the ‘Open Forum’ part of the meeting.
I understand, too, that housing needs surveys can be carried out by organisations other than Parish Councils.
Public Transport
At the end of 1989 following a meeting with Lancashire County Council Transport Department it was agreed that the minibus bringing children to Scorton School should be able to take fare-paying passengers to the A6 to connect with the bus services to Lancaster and Preston.
This arrangement, together with lifts provided by kind friends and neighbours, was felt to cover the needs of people without their own transport.
Bridge Station Lane
The narrow bridge on Station Lane, though part of St Peter's Parish, is in fact outside Nether Wyresdale Parish boundary.
Best Kept Village
As you may know Scorton will again enter the Best Kept Village competition in 1992.
Various individual items, shop, farm, school etc are also entered for certificates of merit and I would like your permission to enter St Peter's Church under the heading ‘Place of Worship’ as happened in 1991.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
I have been asked to draw your attention to the following matters raised at the Annual Parish Meeting of Nether Wyresdale:
Street Lights Gubberford Lane
A request was made by local residents for street lighting on the section of Gubberford Lane to the South of the railway bridge where there are houses on one side of the road.
It was suggested that three or four lights would be sufficient and that they would make a worthwhile contribution to road safety on this dangerous stretch of road where there is no footpath.
Graffiti — Motorway Bridge Tithe Barn Lane
I understand there is still a considerable amount of graffiti on the motorway bridge over Tithe Barn Lane.
Please can something be done to remove it.
Future Plans for Road Works
I have been asked to enquire about any road works that may be in the pipeline for Scorton and the surrounding area.
Please can you let me know if there are any road works scheduled for the near future.
(Station Lane where the water authority has been installing a pipe is especially in need of repair.)
Yours sincerely
Dear Sir:
Former Mill Ponds, Scorton
At the recent meeting of Nether Wyresdale Parish Council I was asked to write and express the council's concern about the apparently unauthorised tipping taking place on the area known as ‘the Cut’ in Scorton.
This is the site of the former mill ponds and it appears that uncontrolled dumping of builders' rubble and other waste material possibly of a dangerous nature is taking place.
In particular the northernmost pond is being filled in and levelled.
There is a water-course running through the site and polluted waste could easily find its way into this stream and eventually into the River Wyre.
I should be grateful if you could look into the environmental health aspects of this and take appropriate action.
Yours faithfullly
Dear 
Former Mill Ponds Scorton
At the recent meeting of Nether Wyresdale Parish Council concern was expressed about the apparently unauthorised and uncontrolled tipping taking place in the area known as ‘the Cut’ in Scorton.
This is the site of old mill ponds and the northernmost pond in particular is being filled in with builder's rubble and other material.
The area is the subject of a planning application which, I understand, is not yet finalised but is awaiting decisions on what used to be ‘section 52 agreements’.
I should be grateful if you would ask your enforcement officer to look into this matter.
Please would you let me know the outcome of your enquiries.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
Public Conveniences — Scorton
I have been asked to write to you about the restricted availability of the public toilets in Scorton.
Over the Easter weekend there were complaints that the toilets were closed as early as five p.m.
Scorton caters for large numbers of holiday visitors especially in the summer months and it would seem sensible to keep the toilets open at least until after dusk.
I should be grateful if you would look into this matter.
If there is any problem with the actual locking up, I understand a local resident had offered to do this.
I look forward to hearing from you.
Yours sincerely

Dear 
Planning Application 02/92/0377 Residential Caravan land at Bryn Mor Long Lane Scorton
The above application has been passed round Nether Wyresdale Parish Council for comments.
The majority of the Parish Council felt that their comments on applications 02/91/1443 and 02/92/0124 (for an agricultural worker's dwelling on the same site) still apply to the present application.
(See my letters of November 18 1991 and February 24 1992.)
The points made then were that the application is contrary to the stated policy of the local planning authority where new dwellings in the countryside have to be justified by agricultural need.
The application does not fall within the Structure Plan for the area and to allow it would create a precedent.
There was, however, some sympathy for the applicant in his desire to set up a viable farming unit.
It was pointed out that the Borough Council has accepted that nearby farms have become redundant and the conversion of farm buildings to up-market residential properties has been allowed.
I trust you will pass these comments to the planning committee when they consider this application.I should be grateful if you would acknowledge receipt of this letter.
Yours sincerely
Dear Sir:
Account No 04922182 Nether Wyresdale Parish Council
Thank you for sending me the closing statement for the above account.
Please could you also let me have the last two cheques debited to the account.
These were cheque no 000075 for £10.98 and no 000076 for £829.83.
Many thanks.

Dear 
Broken Lamp Standard Station Lane Scorton
I have been asked to write to you about the street light outside Annfield on Station Lane Scorton.
Although a new lamp standard has been installed to replace the one that was damaged the old post has not been removed.
Please could you look into this and arrange for its removal.
Many thanks.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
Thank you for your letter inviting comment from the Parish Council on the management of the Forest of Bowland AONB which has been passed round the members of Nether Wyresdale Parish Council.
The following comments were made:
i)
There was a general approval for the work of the Countryside Management Service in protecting the AONB.
ii)
It was felt that some of the local footpaths and bridleways would benefit from more attention — the individual paths were not specified.
iii)
The Mill Yard, the derelict former mill and the associated mill pond in Scorton were mentioned as examples of what should not be allowed to happen.
(I realise this area is outside the AONB but it is within the conservation area.)
iv)
It was felt that development within the AONB should be very strictly controlled.
Although this area has not suffered too much in the past it was mentioned that now many farm buildings are being declared ‘redundant’ and given planning consent for residential development (barn conversions etc) while a short distance away there is an application for a farmhouse from someone wanting to start an agricultural holding.
v)
It was also thought that adequate facilities should be provided for the needs of tourists and visitors in the form of parking, signposts, information leaflets etc.
At the same time an acceptable balance should be maintained between commercial interests and the character of the area and the welfare of the local residents.
Yours sincerely

You are cordially invited to attend the next meeting of Nether Wyresdale Parish Council on Thursday 14th May at 7.30 p.m. in the C E School Scorton.

Thank you for your recent letter.
Nether Wyresdale Parish Council meets at 7.30 p.m. in the C E School in Scorton on Thursday evenings approximately every six weeks.
The next meeting is on Thursday 14th May.
You may find it a long way to come for a comparatively short meeting and I should also mention that we have a regular reporter who covers the meeting on behalf of the Courier and the Garstang Guardian.
I attach a copy of the Agenda and look forward to meeting you.
Yours sincerely

Dear 
Thank you for your letter dated 6th April.
May I wish you every success in your new job.
At the last Parish Council meeting concern was expressed about a number of recent incidents.
I understand that a local resident, a nurse, found a packet of dangerous drugs on the playing field near the children's swings.
I think this has already been reported to your office.
There is also growing concern about drinking by young people both on the playing field and in various other places round the village.
The windows of the Methodist Church adjoining the playing field have been broken numerous times.
As soon as they are replaced they are broken again and the church authorities are considering wire netting as a protection.
When similar problems arose some time ago your predecessor Inspector Pinder and PC Shaw from Cabus came to a Parish Council meeting to advise us on what steps could be taken and there was some improvement.
I would, therefore, like to invite you to the next meeting of Nether Wyresdale Parish Council.
We meet in the C E School at 7.30 pm on a Thursday and the next meeting will be either 2nd, 9th or 16th July.
Please could you let me know which of these is convenient.
You can contact me on Garstang 604755 after 5 pm most evenings.
I look forward to hearing from you.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
Insurance
Please could you take a look at the enclosed details of the PC Insurance policy and advise on whether it is O.K.
The schedule seems to list so many exclusions that I sometimes wonder just what is included!
Are we perhaps paying insurance for something — say the playing field — that is also covered by WBC's insurers?
From the ‘Notice to Policyholders’ and the circular from NALC it looks as though the council are not covered for libel and slander.
We've already paid the ordinary renewal fee, but do you think we should also have libel slander and officials indemnity?
Many thanks.
Yours sincerely
Dear Sirs:
Former Mill Ponds, Scorton
I have been asked by Nether Wyresdale Parish Council to express their grave concern about the apparently haphazard and uncontrolled infilling of the area in Scorton known as ‘the Cut’ the site of the former mill ponds.
Builders' rubble and other waste material some of it possibly of a dangerous nature is being dumped there and in particular the northernmost pond is being filled in and levelled.
The Parish Council has several times contacted Wyre Borough Council about this and I have letters from your department dated 24th January 1991 and 6 February 1991 on this matter.
In the second letter you mentioned that you had asked Wyre Borough for further details of ownership of the site etc.
I wonder if you ever received them and what the outcome was.
I understand that Wyre Borough are forwarding to you a copy of a recent letter to their Environmental Health Officer from Nether Wyresdale Parish Council and I write to reiterate the concern felt by the Parish Council about this site especially the environmental and health hazards involved.
Perhaps you would let me know what action you are able to take on this matter.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
Ownership of Cobbled Areas in Scorton Village
Please can you clarify the legal ownership of the cobbled areas outside some of the houses in the centre of Scorton village.
I understand that one of the frontagers is considering removing the cobbles entirely and tarmacing the area in front of his house.
The house in question is known as Earls Fold and is next to Springfield Farm on the west side of the Square.
The Parish Council have asked me to find out if he is entitled to do this and, if there are any planning or highway restraints on what he may do.
I look forward to hearing from you.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
Highway Matters — Nether Wyresdale
At the recent meeting of Nether Wyresdale Parish Council I was asked to draw your attention to the following highway matters:
i)
The highway outside Springfield Farm in the centre of Scorton village is in a bad state of repair.
ii)
There is a deep pothole on Tithe Barn Lane opposite the bowling green.
iii)
A drain on Gubberford Lane opposite Ashcroft regularly backs up when there is heavy rain.
A large puddle results and drivers swerve into the middle of the road to avoid it with consequent danger to oncoming vehicles and pedestrians.
It seems that it is the soakaway rather than the actual drain that is defective.
Please would you investigate and see what can be done about the above.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
Planning Application 02/92/0580 Erection of Electrical Substation
Thank you for sending the Parish Council a copy of the above planning application.
Nether Wyresdale Parish Council have asked me to let you know that they have no objections to the proposal providing it is in keeping with the present development on the site.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
Temporary Caravan Sites
I have been asked by Nether Wyresdale Parish Council to seek clarification on the planning regulations concerning temporary caravan sites and caravan rallies.
I have been told that a landowner can allow caravans to park on his land for up to 28 days per year without having to obtain planning consent.
I also understand that certain groups, such as the Caravan Club are ‘exempt organisations’ and can hold caravan rallies etc without needing planning consent.
Please can you:
i)
Confirm that the information I have been given is correct
ii)
Supply a list of the ‘exempt organisations’.
iii)
Let me know what controls are operated to ensure that a group is in fact one of these organisations — do they have to inform your department, for example, and do you make any checks on short-term caravan rallies.
I should mention that there are no complaints about the recent caravan rally in a field off Gubberford Lane over the May Day Bank Holiday; I am simply seeking clarification of the regulations for future reference.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
Footway Lighting Gubberford Lane
I wrote to Lancashire County Council recently asking them to consider installing street lighting on the section of Gubberford Lane to the south of the railway bridge.
I enclose a copy of their reply.
As you can see although Gubberford Lane has been added to a list ‘awaiting financial approval’ this may not be forthcoming for a long time.
The Parish Council would, therefore, like to pursue the option suggested in the letter and install footway lighting on Gubberford Lane south of the railway bridge.
Extra lighting would make a worthwhile contribution to road safety on this dangerous stretch of road with houses on one side no footpath.
The cost of lighting puts it beyond the reach of the Parish Council so they should like to request that Wyre Borough Council install footway lighting on this part of Gubberford Lane.
Please would you bring this to the attention of the appropriate committee.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
Former Mill Building Scorton
I am addressing this to the Chief Executive as I am uncertain which department deals with matters of building safety.
I'd be grateful if you would pass my letter to the appropriate officer.
I have been asked to express the concern of Nether Wyresdale Parish Council about the safety aspect of the now derelict mill building on the Dairy Yard in Scorton.
The building is in a dilapidated state and the council are very concerned about the danger to children playing in or around the building.
They appreciate that the mill is private property and that there is a notice to this effect at the entrance to the site, but they still feel that the building should be either made secure or demolished.
It is too late when some child is injured.
The Parish Council want to do everything in their power to prevent a serious accident.
I would be grateful if you could give this matter your urgent attention.
Yours sincerely
Dear Sir:
Railway Embankment Station Lane Scorton
I have been asked by Nether Wyresdale Parish Council to draw your attention to the very overgrown and untidy state of the railway embankment alongside Station Lane in Scorton.
Brambles, foliage and long grass are starting to encroach onto the highway.
Please would you investigate and arrange for the necessary maintenance work to be put in hand.
I should also mention the mess left near the bridge on Gubberford Lane Scorton after work done recently to clean up the sides of the bridge.
The debris, dead foliage, branches and twigs were simply thrown onto the roadway and left for passing traffic and public-spirited citizens to remove.
Some debris still remains and I should be grateful if you would arrange for its immediate removal and also ensure that they same thing does not happen when the embankment on Station Lane is tidied.
Yours faithfullly
Dear 
Claimed Public Footpath Nickey Nook, Scorton
Thank you for your letter of 24th April concerning claim No 804/183.
I have passed it round the members of Nether Wyresdale Parish Council for comments.
They endorse the comments made earlier and are in favour of the route marked in red being designated as a public footpath in addition to the existing footpath No 17.
They also ask that both paths should be clearly signed and that the paths should be open and not fenced on either side.
I hope this is useful to you in determining the claim.
Yours sincerely
Dear Sirs:
Policy No 11/AC/7022/06
Account No 11/99/24799
Nether Wyresdale Parish Council sought advice following your Notice to Policyholders about cover for Libel and Slander and Officials Indemnity.
It is likely that they will ask your organisation to provide this cover.
I should, therefore, be grateful if you would confirm that for a Parish of this size (population under 500) the additional premium would be £25 per year.
The next meeting of the Parish Council is on 16th July.
Please could you let me have the appropriate proposal forms by then.
Many thanks.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
Scorton War Memorial and Playing Field — Insurance
I have been asked to make enquiries about property insurance for Nether Wyresdale Parish Council.
Wyre Borough is responsible for the maintenance of Scorton playing field and the upkeep of the play equipment and the seats and also for the maintenance of the War Memorial in the village.
Please could you let me know if your insurance covers damage to these items, either by deliberate vandalism or accidental damage such as impact by a vehicle.
I should be grateful for a prompt reply so that I can report on this to the next meeting of the Parish Council on 16th July.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
Gate on Children's Play Area Scorton Playing Field
I have been asked to pass on to you comments received from a member of the public about the gate in the fence which your department recently erected round the play equipment on Scorton playing field.
The complaint concerns the ‘dangerous nature of the gate on the children's playground in Scorton.
It closes very rapidly and has considerable momentum.
There is, therefore a significant risk of serious injury especially to small children.
I believe simply repositioning the lower hinge would reduce the problem.’
(I quote from a written complaint received.)
I understand similar fencing was erected on other playing fields around the borough so this problem may not be confined to Scorton.
Please could you look into it as a matter of urgency.
Several local people have also commented that the fence isn't dog-proof.
Dogs can easily leap over it or get in through the hedge on the south side.
Yours sincerely
Dear Sir
Previous Correspondence
At the request of Nether Wyresdale Parish Council I wrote to you on 25th May concerning the state of the railway embankment on Station Lane Scorton and the mess left around the railway bridge on Gubberford Lane Scorton.
I haven't as yet received a response to my letter, not even an acknowledgement.
I enclose a copy of the letter in case you did not receive the original or have mislaid it.
There is a meeting of the Parish Council on 16th July and I should like to be able to bring your reply to that meeting.
I look forward to hearing from you soon.
Yours faithfullly
Dear Neil
At the last meeting of Nether Wyresdale Parish Council I was asked to write and thank you for all the hard work you have put in to make the centre of Scorton look so nice.
The councillors all agree that your floral displays and hanging baskets are magnificent and want you to know that they appreciate your efforts.
As you will know, because we were one of the finalists last year, we can't get into the finals of Britain in Bloom this year, nor can we win an award as a ‘first time entry’ in the Best Kept Village competition.
But I'm sure your flowers will impress the judges of both these competitions.
Many thanks, and keep up the good work!
Yours sincerely
Dear Sirs:
St Peter's Churchyard Scorton
Nether Wyresdale Parish Council have received a letter from St Peter's Parochial Church Council, Scorton concerning the churchyard.
As this is in fact used as the Parish Burial Ground and not restricted to members of St Peter's church they feel that responsibility for its upkeep should not be left to a relatively small number of volunteers.
They asked the Parish Council, therefore, to approach Wyre Borough and ask for help with tasks such as mowing etc.
It was agreed at the last meeting of the Parish Council to endorse this request.
I hope you will be able to arrange for some assistance, possibly by including the burial ground in your Grounds Maintenance contract.
If you wish to contact the Parochial Church Council direct the secretary is: Miss Jane Farnworth, Mossgiel, Station Lane, Scorton, Preston PR3 1AN.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
St Peter's Churchyard, Scorton
Thank you for your letter of 19th June 92.
This was brought before the Parish Council meeting on 16th July and they agreed to endorse your request for assistance in maintaining the Parish Burial Ground.
I was asked to write to Wyre Borough Council about this and I enclose a copy of the letter I sent.
As you will see I included your name and address so Wyre may reply directly to you.
Rural Development Programme
On another matter, I received from Wyre Borough Council details of the funding scheme for projects under the Rural Development Programme and I enclose a copy in case the PCC have any ideas which they might like to put forward.
Yours sincerely
Dear

Dear 
Provision of Bench
Your kind offer to provide a bench in memory of your late father was put before the Parish Council at their recent meeting.
They would like to accept your offer with many thanks.
Perhaps you could contact the chairman of the Parish Council, Mr Paul Brown of 14 Brook Avenue, Scorton Preston, PR3 1AR.
Telephone 0524 792 384 to discuss the siting of the bench.
The Parish Council would be glad to accept ownership of the bench and to be responsible for its upkeep.
However, they could not guarantee to replace it if it were damaged or vandalised.
(I'm sorry if this seems like looking a gift horse in the mouth but these things do occur.)
With many thanks for your kind offer.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
Policy Number 11/AC 7022/06
Thank you for your letter of 24 May 1992.
At their recent meeting Nether Wyresdale Parish Council agreed to ask you to extend their insurance cover to include Libel and Slander and Officials' Indemnity.
Please find enclosed a cheque for £25, being the premium for this cover and the tear-off slip from your letter, duly completed.
Yours sincerely

Rural Development Grants
Nether Wyresdale Parish Council received the enclosed information about the Rural Development Programme 1993/4 from Wyre Borough Council.
I have been asked to send copies to the churches in Scorton, the Public Hall, the Bowling Club etc.
If there are any projects you feel would be eligible for R D grants perhaps you would let me know or, if you prefer contact Wyre Borough direct.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
Cobbled Areas in Centre of Scorton
I have been asked to enquire about the status of the cobbled areas in front of some of the houses in the centre of Scorton village within the conservation areas.
What is the status of these areas as far as planning goes?
What would be the response of the planning authority if one of the owners decided to remove the cobbles or tarmac over them?
I should be grateful for your comments on this so I can bring them before the Parish Council at their next meeting on 27th August.
I look forward to hearing from you.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
Letter dated May 21st 1992 re Caravan Rallies
I have not yet received a reply to my letter dated 21st May 1992 asking for information about temporary caravan sites and caravan rallies.
I enclose a copy in case the original has gone astray.
I should be grateful for a prompt reply so that I can present it to the Parish Council at their next meeting on 27th August.
I look forward to hearing from you.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
Old Mill Chimney Low Dolphinholme
At the recent meeting of Nether Wyresdale Parish Council the subject of listed buildings in Low Dolphinholme was discussed.
Please could you let me know if the old mill chimney in the grounds of one of the houses there is a listed building and if it is not what is the correct procedure for having it listed.
I look forward to hearing from you.
Yours sincerely
Dear Sir:
Tithe Barn Lane, Scorton
Nether Wyresdale Parish Council have asked me to write and draw your attention to the gas substation on Tithe Barn Lane, Scorton.
I understand the fenced area immediately around the building is very untidy and full of nettles.
Scorton is entered in both the Wyre in Bloom and the Best Kept Village competitions.
We have a large influx of tourists in the Summer and despite this try to keep the village looking as nice as possible.
Please can you arrange for the substation to be tidied up.
Yours faithfullly
Dear Sir
Flood Bank, Gubberford Lane, Scorton
I have been asked by Nether Wyresdale Parish Council to draw your attention to the state of the flood embankment alongside the river Wyre on Gubberford Lane near Gubberford Bridge.
I understand the actual embankment and the area between the embankment and the highway are your responsibility.
The Parish Council has received complaints that the embankment near the bridge is untidy and full of nettles.
Please could you look into this and see what can be done to remedy the situation.
Many thanks.
Yours faithfullly
Dear Sir
Footpath No 40 Nether Wyresdale
At the recent meeting of Nether Wyresdale Parish Council it was reported that a bridge on footpath No 40 was in need of repair.
Footpath No 40 leaves the road at approximately GR SD 507498 and the bridge is the second after leaving the road.
I should be very grateful if you would look into the matter.
Yours faithfullly
Dear 
Rural Development Programme 1993/94
Thank you for your letter of 8th July about suitable projects for funding by the Rural Development Programme 1993/94.
I have passed it round the various organisations within the parish and some of them may reply directly to your office.
I have received a request from the Village Hall Committee for financial assistance towards providing play equipment for the recently formed mother and toddler group.
The letter says ‘Up to the present time items of play equipment have been loaned by Scorton Village School but these have now had to be returned and replacement equipment will be most beneficial for the group to continue.
In the information given regarding projects it would appear that a Mother and Toddler Group would fall into Section 3, Priority 1.’
I should, therefore, like to put forward a preliminary application on behalf of the Village Hall Mother and Toddler Group.
Further details of the equipment required and likely cost can be supplied on request.
The Secretary of the Village Hall Committee is Mr F Seddon of Inglenook Cottage, Station Lane, Scorton Preston PR3 1AP.
Tel: 0524 791 761.
I understand also that Scorton Tennis Club will be contacting you direct concerning financial aid towards tarmacing the present grass court and thus making it suitable for all weather use both by members of the club, visitors to the village and pupils of the village school.
I trust you will look favourably on both these applications and on any others that may be sent in by the various organisations within the village.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
I would like to invite you to the meeting of Nether Wyresdale Parish Council on Thursday 27th August at 7.30 p.m. in Scorton School.

Dear Neil:
Tree Warden Training Course
I was delighted to hear that you have agreed to be Tree Warden for Nether Wyresdale Parish.
I enclose details of the Tree Warden Training Day to be held on Saturday 5th September in Scorton Village Hall.
I hope you'll be able to attend.
At least it isn't far to travel!
Please could you fill in the form and let them know whether you will be attending.
I'll let Alison Boden have your name and address so from now on items like this will come directly to you.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
Village Sports Information Pack
I must apologise for taking so long to respond to your offer of a Village Sports Information Pack.
If one is still available for Nether Wyresdale Parish I should be grateful if you would send it to Councillor R Collinson, The Priory, The Square, Scorton, Preston.
Councillor Collinson is the owner of the local post office and general stores and it was agreed at the recent meeting of the Parish Council that this would be a good way of ensuring that the information pack was readily accessible by anyone wishing to consult it.
Local Government Review
I also enclose the questionnaire on Current Parish views, duly completed.
Yours sincerely
Dear Alison:

Dear 
TV Satellite Dish
Nether Wyresdale Parish Council have asked me to draw your attention to a satellite dish erected recently on a house in Station Lane.
The house is part of the three-storey terrace on the right-hand side after leaving the Square, Scorton.
The Parish Council are of the opinion the satellite dish requires planning approval and it appears that no application has been made.
I should be grateful if you would look into the matter and let me know the outcome.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
Planning Application 02/92/0948
Thank you for sending a copy of the above planning application to Nether Wyresdale Parish Council.
The majority of the councillors have no objection to this development but the following comments were made:
i)
A recent application for an agricultural cottage made by a nearby resident was turned down.
ii)
The character of the area will suffer if further permissions are granted in respect of‘redundant farm buildings’ and buildings lost on this basis are replaced with modern agricultural buildings devoid of character.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
Planning Application 02/92/0233
Thank you for your letter giving further information about this application.
I confirm that the Parish Council has no objection to this development.

Dear 
Incident Scorton Sewage Pumping Station 22nd July 92
Nether Wyresdale Parish Council have received a copy of a letter from a local resident, Mr M J Hodges (my husband) to North West Water Limited concerning the failure of your emergency pumping system during a lengthy electricity power cut on 22nd July.
Fortunately the cut happened at night and power was restored before any noticeable pollution took place.
The Parish Council have asked me to express their grave concern that such an incident could have occurred at all.
If electrical power had not been restored around 8.30 a.m. the river would have suffered serious pollution not only in the Scorton area but also in Garstang and other places downstream.
The Parish Council would welcome your assurance that this was a one-off incident and that steps have now been taken to prevent any recurrence.
I look forward to hearing from you.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
Policy for Sales and Markets
Thank you for your letter of 31st July 92 enclosing Wyre Borough Council's Draft Policy for Sales and Markets.
This has been discussed at the recent meeting of Nether Wyresdale Parish Council and they fully support your proposals.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
Rural Bus Service
Thank you for your letter of 17th August giving details of your proposed new public transport routes in this area.
The Parish Council are agreed that this is a good idea — but I should mention that they all drive cars!
I've displayed your letter on the noticeboard in the village and passed a copy to the local P.C.C.
with the request that any comments should be sent to you.
The non-drivers I've spoken to would all welcome this service.
The walk of over a mile to the nearest bus stop on the A6 can be very off-putting in bad weather.
My personal feeling is that this would be a very good service to have in the rural area but I doubt if you will get enough passengers to make it profitable without a subsidy from the County Council.
I'd like to wish you every success in this venture.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
You are cordially invited to attend Nether Wyresdale Parish Council meeting on Thursday 15th October in the C E School, Scorton at 7.30 p.m.
I hope you are able to come.

Dear 
Planning Application 02/92/1435 Erection of 20 Metre High Mast and 2 Microwave Dishes East of Higher Lane, Scorton
Thank you for sending the Parish Council a copy of the above planning application.
The following points were made by members of the Parish Council:
i)
The site is within an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty where development should be carefully controlled.
ii)
The necessity to fell up to fifty trees to carry out this development is called into question.
iii)
The proposed mast will be some forty feet above the surrounding trees and will be detrimental to the visual amenity of the area.
iv)
On a nearby site there are several masts which have increased in number over the years and if this application is granted it could create a precedent and make other future applications difficult to refuse.
v)
It is felt that sufficient services already exist for the mobile phone network.
vi)
This development will bring no benefit to the local area in terms of jobs or extra amenities.
The Parish council would, therefore, strongly urge your committee to refuse this application.
I trust you will bring the above comments to the attention of your committee when they meet to discuss this application.
Please acknowledge receipt of this letter.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
Public Hall Rates and Water Rates
At the recent meeting of Nether Wyresdale Parish Council it was agreed that the Parish Council would pay the full cost of rates and water rates charged to the Public Hall for the current year.
Accordingly I enclose a cheque for £248.43.
Water rates £121.39
General Business Rates 99.17
Rates already paid 27.87
Total 248.43
The council agreed that it is a matter for concern that the rates have increased by so much and I have been asked to write to Wyre Borough Council about this and to ask if they would consider paying the whole of the rates for public halls in rural areas as I understand some District Councils do.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
Application 02/89/1301 Dairy Yard Development, Scorton
Nether Wyresdale Parish Council have asked me to express their concern at the time taken to finalise this planning decision.
I understand that the conditions relating to the development have not yet been agreed.
Please could you let me know i) if the council has set any time limit on these protracted negotiations and if so what it is and ii) when planning consent is given will it apply from the date the original application was approved or the date the conditions were approved.
The difference of about two years is significant since, as I understand it, an application lapses if not implemented within a certain time.
I should be grateful if you could clarify the above points.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
Rents for Council Dwellings
Nether Wyresdale Parish Council have asked me to write and express their utmost concern at the policy adopted by Wyre Borough Council on Rents for Council Dwellings as expressed in the minutes of the Housing and Environmental Services Committee (8th September 92 HS.59).
The Parish Council understand that council house rents will be reassessed to take account of whether or not they are in ‘desirable’ areas.
The net result we are told will be an increase in rent for most council tenants in rural areas and a decrease for all tenants in Fleetwood.
Once again the rural areas are being treated less favourably that the towns.
Council tenants in rural areas such as Scorton enjoy fewer amenities than in urban areas.
There is also a lack of affordable housing for rent or purchase by young couples in the villages.
Young people and first time buyers are forced to look for accommodation outside their local rural area and the villages are being deprived of an important element in the community.
The Parish Council were particularly disturbed to find that there was no consultation with local town or parish councils on this matter
I would be grateful for your comments on the above points.
Yours sincerely

A couple of items for the ‘What's On’ section of the Parish Magazine:

Proposed Communication Mast, Scorton
It was suggested at the recent meeting of Nether Wyresdale Parish Council that I send you a copy of the objections made by the Parish Council to the siting of a communication mast on land off Higher Lane, Scorton.
As you can see the Parish Council are totally opposed to the siting of the mast in this particular position, and they would welcome any comments you might wish to make in support of their case.
Yours faithfullly
Dear 
Village Hall Rating
For a number of years Nether Wyresdale Parish Council have supported the local Village Hall by paying the annual rates and water rates.
At their recent meeting the Parish Council were disturbed to find that both these bills have increased substantially.
In 1991/92 the rates were £23.35 and the water rates were £42.37; the corresponding figures for 1992/93 are £127.04 and £121.39 — a five-fold increase in rates and nearly threefold in water rates.
It was recalled that when the Community Charge was introduced and differential rating for the rural areas of the borough ceased, to compensate the rural areas the Borough Council undertook to pay Parish Clerks' salaries and to be responsible for the maintenance of playing fields.
The suggestion was made that the Borough Council should make a discretionary grant of 100% rate relief to public halls in the rural part of the borough.
This would go some way towards producing an equitable balance of provision between the urban and rural areas.
I understand this is already done in some districts.
Please would you consider this suggestion in your next round of budgetary deliberations.
Yours sincerely
Dear Sir:
Item held at bank
Your branch recently contacted the Parish Council about a sealed item which you are holding for us.
We authorise Mrs M Hodges, clerk to the Parish Council to remove the sealed item on our behalf.
Please permit her to do so as arranged with you by phone.

Grounds Maintenance Area around Public Conveniences Scorton
I have been asked to draw your attention to the street light on Gubberford Lane near the public conveniences.
It is almost completely obscured by the tree which surrounds it and hides the light under its foliage.
I understand your contractors maintain the grass outside the neighbouring bungalows and trim the hedges round the playing field.
Would it be possible for them also to prune this tree hard back so the light can be seen.
Please can you arrange this necessary work to be put in hand.
If I have addressed this to the wrong department I'd be grateful if you would pass my letter on to the appropriate person.
Many thanks.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
Give Way Sign Tithe Barn Lane at junction with Gubberford Lane, Scorton
I have been asked to draw your attention to the junction of Tithe Barn Lane and Gubberford Lane, Scorton.
The give way sign on Tithe Barn Lane is obscured by foliage and for vehicles approaching down Tithe Barn Lane visibility is very poor.
In a recent incident a vehicle failed to stop at the junction and damaged Curwen House the building on Gubberford Lane almost opposite the end of Tithe Barn Lane.
Please would you look into the matter and see what can be done to improve the situation.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
Listed Building
I understand that Wyre Borough Council are currently examining Listed Buildings in the area and their state of repair.
At the recent meeting of Nether Wyresdale Parish Council I was asked to draw your attention to the mill chimney in the garden of the Old Mill House on Wagon Road Dolphinholme.
The chimney itself is not listed separately, though the surrounding wall is listed.
It was felt that you might wish to remedy this discrepancy.
The house concerned is near the footpath from Wagon Road to Scott Wood in Low Dolphinholme.
One of the Parish Councillors, Councillor R Drinkall lives nearby and would be happy to direct you.
His phone number is (0524) 792106 (home) or (0524) 39039 (work).
Yours sincerely
Dear Neil:
Nether Wyresdale Parish Council have asked me to write and congratulate you on your recent success in the Best Kept Village Competition where you won the award for the Best Kept Farm.
Many congratulations on a well deserved win.
Springfield Farm is always a pleasure to look at and I'm sure it is appreciated by visitors to the village.
Keep up the good work.
With best wishes
Yours sincerely
Dear 
Roadside Seat Higher Lane
Thank you for your letter of 28th October.
I have spoken to Mr Rhodes the owner (there is no tenant) of the land adjacent to the proposed site of the roadside seat as shown on your map.
He confirms that he has no objection to the location of the seat providing that it is to the North of the large holly tree on his land.
From your map this would seem to be the case.
Please would you, therefore, go ahead with the necessary documentation.
Many thanks.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
White Lines Gubberford Bridge
Nether Wyresdale Parish Council asked me to draw your attention to the white lines on Gubberford Lane at the river bridge.
It was thought that the position of these encourages motorists to cut the corner when coming over the bridge thus causing a hazard to vehicles and pedestrians coming the other way.
Please could you look into the matter with a view to re-positioning the lines if you consider it necessary.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
Thank you for your reply to my letter of 24th October regarding Village Hall rates and water rates.
Your reply outlined the current situation and explained why there were large increases in both rates and water rates for Scorton Village Hall this year.
The Parish Council are aware of the reason for the increase in rates, though the amount of the increase was a surprise and seems excessive.
However, your reply did not address the main point of my letter: the request that the Borough Council should consider paying the rates of public halls in the rural part of the Borough.
The Parish Council think this would go some way towards producing a more equitable balance of service provision between the urban and rural areas.
You will of course recall that with the introduction of community charge the differential rating of the rural areas of the Borough ceased.
The rural charge-payers now pay more than the urban charge-payers since they pay the same basic charge plus the charge for Parish Council services, yet the provision of services by the Borough favours the urban areas.
In order to compensate for this the Borough Council took on the responsibility for payment of the Parish Clerk's salary and the maintenance of parish playing fields.
While this is a welcome help it does little to compensate for the difference in service provision between the urban and rural areas.
To help correct the imbalance the Parish Council are requesting the Borough to pay the rates on the public halls in the rural areas.
This is only fair.
The 1992/93 Revenue Budget shows an estimated expenditure of £228730 on the Marine Hall Fleetwood, the Lecture Hall Thornton and the Meeting Room Cleveleys.
In the rural areas people have to pay for the costs of their halls.
Will you please ensure that this request is put before the appropriate committee as part of the coming budget cycle.
I would also point out that the inequality will increase further with the change to council tax since the banding will result in still greater contributions from the rural areas where house prices are inflated.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
Presentation Monday 8th February 1993
Thank you for your letter inviting Nether Wyresdale Parish Councillors and members of the parish to the presentation on Council Tax on Monday 8th February 1993 in Forton Village Hall.
I will bring your letter to the attention of the Parish Council at their meeting next week and do what I can to inform any local residents who may be interested.
Yours sincerely
Dear Parish Councillor
You are hereby summoned to attend the meeting of Nether Wyresdale Parish Council to be held on Thursday 26th November in the C E School Scorton at 7.30 p.m.
Yours faithfully
Dear 
The next meeting of Nether Wyresdale Parish Council is on Thursday 26th November at 7.30 p.m. in Scorton School.
I hope you are able to come.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
Planning Application 02/92/1629 Land South of Ashcroft Gubberford Lane
Thank you for the copy of the above planning application which has been discussed by Nether Wyresdale Parish Council.
The majority of the Parish Council object to this development because it is out of keeping with the surrounding properties in size, design and proposed building materials.
They had no objections to application 02/90/1065 for a bungalow which was in keeping with the character of the surrounding area, but the present application for a large house with brick walls and a concrete tile roof is totally out of place and would dominate the adjacent properties to an unacceptable degree.
I trust you will bring these comments to the attention of your planning committee when they meet to discuss this application.
I should be grateful if you would acknowledge receipt of this letter.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
Consultation Paper — Role of Parish and Town Councils
Your consultation paper on the role of Parish and Town Councils has been passed round Nether Wyresdale Parish Council for comments.
I must apologise for the delay in responding.
The only comment made was that a small parish such as Nether Wyresdale (less than 500 electors) could not contemplate taking on any additional direct responsibilities.
It was also felt that the views of Parish Councillors should carry more weight with the Borough Council on local matters in particular planning applications.
It is sometimes felt that the Borough Council, although they seek the views of local representatives, ignore these when coming to decisions on planning matters which will have a profound effect on local residents.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
Footpath No 12
At the recent meeting of Nether Wyresdale Parish Council it mentioned that the stiles on footpath No 12 between Scorton Picnic area and the Trough Road are in need of repair.
I should be grateful if you would look into this.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
Flooding & Road Closure Notices Gubberford Lane
As clerk to the Parish Council I have received complaints about the recent flooding and road closure notices on Gubberford Lane.
Yesterday (2nd December) the road was flooded near the entrance to Broadfall Farm to a depth (I am told) of about six inches.
One or two cars driving too fast got stuck but the road was passable with care.
For most of the day there were flood warning notices but no road closed signs.
This seems appropriate.
Early this morning there were ‘road closed’ signs at Gubberford bridge and near the bottom of Tithebarn Lane, although by then there was only an inch or two of water across the road.
Because of these misleading signs which said ‘road closed’ not ‘flooding’the school buses turned back even though the road was passable even in a small car.
As a result children were left waiting for buses which didn't arrive.
Please could you in future:
a) Ensure that appropriate signs are used.
A ‘flood’ sign at the above-mentioned points would allow the drivers of high clearance vehicles to proceed.
b) Ensure that the signs are removed as soon as they no longer apply.
c) Consider installing a depth gauge post at the point where the road regularly floods.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
Security of Mill Building
At the recent meeting of Nether Wyresdale Parish Council I was asked to write to you concerning the security of the Old Mill Building on the Dairy Yard.
The Parish Council has received police complaints that the building is insecure, the upper floor is in an unsafe condition and trespassers have been entering the mill.
Quantities of empty drinks cans have been found in and near the building.
The Parish Council is very concerned, as I am sure you are yourself, that everything possible is done to prevent a serious accident in the Old Mill Building.
Please would you, therefore, look into this as a matter of urgency and take steps to make the building secure.
Wall at Northern Side of the Cut
There have also been complaints that the wall between your property and Limehouse at the northern end of the Cut is dilapidated and in urgent need of attention.
Please would you also look into this and take appropriate action.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
Age Concern
Ms Kate Noble, Support Services Co-ordinator for Age Concern in this area wrote to the Parish Council recently asking for assistance in identifying needs of older people in the rural areas and ways in which those needs could be met by Age Concern.
The Parish Council has invited Ms Noble to attend their next meeting on Thursday 21st January 1993 at 7.30 p.m. in the School.
They would also like to invite representatives from the various churches and other organisations in Scorton to be present.
I should be grateful if you would put this to the Women's Institute and let me know by 14th January if you are able to send a representative to the meeting.
Many thanks.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
NALC Centenary Appeal
Thank you for your recent letter about the NALC Centenary Appeal in which you state that there has been no response from Nether Wyresdale Parish Council.
There must have been some mistake as a cheque for £25 was sent to your on 27th June 1991 and I received a letter of thanks on 30th July 1991.
As Nether Wyresdale is a relatively small parish and does not have a large budget it was decided to make a one-off donation to the appeal.
However, I will bring your letter to the attention of the parish council at their next meeting to see whether they wish to make any further contribution.
Yours sincerely
Dear Sir
I was very interested to read David Smith's report on the dangers of Gubberford Lane, Scorton in Monday's Evening Post.
As clerk to the local Parish Council I should like to point out that Nether Wyresdale Parish Council have been asking for a footpath along this stretch of highway for the last twenty years.
At the request of local residents the Parish Council has also asked for street lighting to be installed and for a speed limit to be introduced along part of this road.
None of these requests has been successful.
Gubberford Lane is a winding country lane and for about a mile it is without footpaths.
There are two narrow bridges, both on bends, and many other blind corners where pedestrians cannot step off the carriageway to avoid oncoming vehicles.
A few years ago we hoped that a footpath would have been incorporated in the flood protection scheme.
The County Council failed to seize this opportunity.
Your County Council spokeswoman implied that as there hadn't been a lot of pedestrians injured or killed on Gubberford Lane a footpath wasn't necessary.
The reason there have been few accidents is that the road is so dangerous pedestrians avoid it and both Scorton residents and the many visitors to the area are denied pedestrian access to the village.
The road is signed to Scorton Picnic site and to the Trough of Bowland and for its size takes a considerable amount of holiday traffic.
There are many walkers, both locals and visitors who would like to use this road if only it were safe to do so.
A footpath is needed and would be well used.
Yours faithfully
Dear Kate Noble

February Parish Magazine
Just a couple of What's On items for the February issue of the Parish Magazine:
I can't be sure of the date of the next Parish Council meeting till after the meeting on Thursday 21st Jan. but there probably won't be a meeting in February.
However please could you mention that Forton Parish Council have arranged a presentation about the new Council Tax by Wyre Borough Council.
This will take place on Monday 8th February at 7.30 p.m. in Forton Village Hall School Lane.
Members of Nether Wyresdale Parish who are interested are invited to attend.

Age Concern Presentation
You may recall out phone conversation some time ago about Age Concern Lancashire.

I hope you will be able to come.
Ms Noble's talk will be the first item on the agenda and you can leave early if you wish to, though you are, of course, welcome to stay for the rest of the meeting.
I look forward to seeing you next Thursday.

Housing Needs Survey
Thank you for your letter of 11th January 93 giving details of the results of the Housing Needs Survey.
Nether Wyresdale Parish Council would like to express their appreciation of the effort that went into carrying out the survey.
They accept that there is a need for affordable housing in Scorton and would support a scheme to provide such housing if a suitable site could be found.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
Planning Application 02/92/1805
Thank you for sending Nether Wyresdale Parish Council a copy of the above-numbered planning application for erection of a detached house on land east of The Lodge, Scorton Hall Park, Scorton.
The Parish Council urge you to refuse consent for this development because:
i)
it would involve the loss of a number of trees and this would be detrimental to the character of this part of the village.
ii)
The position of the proposed dwelling means that natural daylight would be restricted by the proximity of other buildings, the high steep banking and the trees on all sides.
iii)
The proposed dwelling is out of keeping with the nearby existing dwellings and will detract from the character of the stone archway and The Lodge.
iv)
Existing use (question 7) is shown as ‘Garden Ground’; it was felt that ‘remaining area of former woodland’ would be a more appropriate description.
In view of problems experienced previously when consent was granted for a development on a site later discovered not to be in the ownership of the applicant, the Parish Council would like to draw your attention to the fact that the boundary of this site is currently in dispute with the neighbouring landowners (i.e. the R C Church Diocesan Surveyors).
I trust you will bring matters mentioned to the attention of your committee when they meet to discuss this application.
I should be grateful if you would acknowledge receipt of this letter.
Your sincerely
Dear Sir
Public Conveniences — Scorton
At the recent meeting of Nether Wyresdale Parish Council I was asked to contact you concerning the public conveniences on Gubberford Lane, Scorton near the playing field.
It was reported that on New Year's Day these were closed by 3.30 p.m.
This would seem to be unreasonably early considering that Scorton is a tourist area which gets large numbers of visitors on Bank Holidays.
Please would you investigate this problem and let me know what action you take to resolve it.
Yours faithfullly
Dear 
Skip Provision — Scorton 93/94
On behalf of Nether Wyresdale Parish Council I should like to ask your department to provide a rubbish skip as you did last year.
As I mentioned in my recent phone call the best site for it is the Mill Yard, as last year.
I notice that last year we had the skip from 31st March — 7th April.
I've been in touch with the Public Hall and I understand the Mill Yard will be in use as a car park for an Antiques Fair on 28th March 93.
The other dates when it is not available are 6th — 7th March and Easter weekend 9th — 11th April.
Any other dates in March or April should be all right.
I've also written to the owner of the Mill Yard, Mr Whewell to get his consent for the siting of the skip.
I look forward to hearing from you when you have arranged your schedule.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
Use of Mill Yard for Skip
In past years you have been kind enough to allow a skip to be sited on the Mill Yard for the collection of large items of household rubbish.
I'm writing to ask if it would be possible to repeat the exercise in 1993.
As before Lancashire County Council will provide the skip and replace it as necessary.
As last year, they will bring the skip on a Tuesday and remove it a week later.
I do not yet have the exact date but I expect it will be some time during March or April — more likely April.
I have asked them to avoid weekends when the Village Hall has Antiques Fairs booked.
Please could you let me know as soon as possible if you agree to the siting of the skip.
A reply by return would be appreciated, but a phone call will do.
You can contact me on Garstang (0995) 604755 after 5 p.m. most evenings.
Many thanks in anticipation of your help.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
Local Government Reorganisation
I see from the recent article in The Lancaster Guardian that your Council is to contact Parish Councils in neighbouring districts of South Lakeland and Wyre concerning the forthcoming Local Government Review to find out ‘where their greater affinity lies’.
May I suggest that you include the rural parishes in Wyre District as far south as Garstang in this consultation.
I am clerk to Nether Wyresdale Parish Council in Scorton and, while I cannot speak on behalf of either the Parish Council or the residents of the parish, I think it would be appropriate to discuss the possibility of Nether Wyresdale becoming part of Lancaster District.
I look forward to hearing from you.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
Former Mill Ponds, Scorton
At the recent meeting of Nether Wyresdale Parish Council it was reported that the site of the former mill ponds — known as ‘the cut’ in Scorton had again been opened and that tipping was taking place there.
In your letter of 4 June 92 (Your Ref WR/ADC/MRD/M1/2) you asked to be informed of any further tipping in this area.
I do not know the individuals or firms responsible for the tipping, but I should be grateful if you could look into the matter.
Yours sincerely

Highway Matters — Nether Wyresdale
I have been asked to draw your attention to the following:
1.
Sign — Snowhill Lane
The ‘steep hill’ sign on Snowhill Lane has been removed and is lying in the hedge.
2.
Road Works, Gubberford Lane
Before Christmas a hole was opened on the west side of Gubberford Lane near the flood protection wall just south of the railway bridge.
Barriers and warning lights were put up and further warning lights were placed a short distance away.
No further work has taken place for a number of weeks, the barriers have fallen down, one of the warning lights has been thrown into the river and another has been thrown into the hedge several times.
Please can you look into this and arrange for the job to be finished as soon as possible.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
Grounds Maintenance Contract — Scorton Playing Field
Thank you for giving me brief details of the grounds maintenance agreed for Scorton Playing Field when I spoke to you on the phone recently.
I'd be very grateful if you could let me have written confirmation of exactly what is involved and how often the various procedures are to be carried out on the playing field and the area around the War Memorial in Scorton.
Please can you also let me know the name of the contractors.
Many thanks.

Account no 2611 074783 68 — Nether Wyresdale Parish Council

I'm afraid that District Audit insist on this for Parish Council accounts.
The last cheque written was cheque no. 000007 for £250 payable to Scorton C E School and according to your statement cashed on 29 January.
I'd be grateful if you could let me have this cheque as soon as possible.

Entertainment Licence Priory Cafe Scorton
Following our telephone conversation today I write to confirm that Nether Wyresdale Parish Council will discuss the entertainment licence applied for by the Priory Cafe Scorton at their next meeting on Thursday 18th March.

I will write again as soon as I know the opinion of the Parish Council.

Fylde Coast Bike Ride 16th May 1993
I have seen details of the Fylde Coast Bike Ride in my son's copy of Bike Events and, as clerk to Nether Wyresdale Parish Council (which is centred on the village of Scorton), I am concerned about what look like mistakes in the advertised route and final destination.
The advertisement says ‘All routes finish at Scorton Village Green’.
Scorton doesn't have a village green.
Is this a mistake for some other village?
Scorton does have a playing field, but this is administered by the Parish Council and no application has been made to use it for a finishing point.
It is restricted to the use of children under 14 and in my opinion would not be suitable for large numbers of bikes or support vehicles.
Neither Scorton Village Hall, the local cafe nor the local police have been contacted by your organisation and I am puzzled about what arrangements have been made to provide for the arrival of scores of riders.
Perhaps I should mention that Scorton is a prime target for day trippers and on fine Sundays in the summer is packed out with cars and coaches.
It has inadequate parking and only very limited toilet facilities.
Any number of vehicles trying to pick up the finishers will have great difficulty parking and will probably cause a major obstruction.
With reference to starting points, Wyre is the name of a Borough Council covering a large area of the North Fylde but there is no town or village of Wyre and as a starting point ‘Wyre’ does not make sense.
Please don't think that I'm just trying to raise objections to your event.
I know the British Heart Foundation is a worthy cause and I'm a regular cyclist myself.
But I am concerned that mass sponsored rides can be very chaotic and any difficulties caused could raise a backlash against both your cause and cyclists in general.
Please keep me informed of any developments in your plans.
Yours faithfullly

Dear 
Application for Entertainments Licence — Priory Restaurant Scorton
Thank you for your letter of 9th March 1993.
Nether Wyresdale Parish Council discussed the above application at their recent meeting.
Councillor Collinson (the applicant) declared an interest and left the meeting.
The rest of the Parish Council were unanimous in opposing the granting of a licence for music, singing and dancing for the Priory Restaurant function room Snowhill, Scorton for the following reasons:
i)
The restaurant is in the centre of the village, surrounded by residential properties, one of which actually adjoins the function room, and the noise of loud music, particularly disco-type music, would adversely affect the quality of life of nearby residents.
ii)
The slamming of car doors and the revving of car engines late at night when customers are leaving would create a further disturbance.
iii)
The extra traffic this development might be expected to generate would exacerbate the already serious parking problems in the village.
iv)
Scorton Village Hall is already licensed for music, singing and dancing and is more than adequate to meet the needs of the local community.
v)
The application, if granted, would appear to allow entertainments involving music, singing and dancing to take place until a late hour every night of the week, every day of the year.
While the local residents might tolerate the noise and disruption from an occasional late night party, some limitation needs to be set on the number of such functions that can take place.
vi)
This application, if granted, would effectively destroy the ‘comparative peace and quiet which the residents of Scorton now enjoy after the daytime visitors have left’.
(I quote from the report of the DoE Inspector in June 1972 upholding the planning committee's refusal of planning consent for an inn.)
vii)
I also note that the application refers to the ‘Priory Restaurant’ not simply to the function room, formerly the Church Hall.
Entertainments including music, singing and dancing held in the lower cafe part of the Priory would be even closer to residential properties in the village square and thus more likely to disturb local residents.
I trust you will pass the above comments to the Licensing Sub-Committee when they meet to determine this case.
I understand that you will let me know the date, time and place of their meeting.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
Use of Mill Yard for Rubbish Skip
Thank you for your letter of 2nd February giving permission for the use of the Mill Yard for siting of a rubbish skip.
Lancashire County Council tell me the skip will be provided from Tuesday 30th March to Tuesday 6th April.
We are also arranging a litter pick round the centre of the village on Saturday 3rd April staring at 10.30 a.m. from the Mill Yard.
As last year, bin bags and litter picking sticks will be provided.
All we need are volunteers!
Many thanks for your co-operation.

Railway Embankment Station Lane Scorton
At their recent meeting Nether Wyresdale Parish Council asked me to draw your attention to the untidy and overgrown state of the railway embankment on Station Lane, Scorton.
Brambles from the embankment are beginning to encroach onto the highway causing problems both for pedestrians and for vehicles.
I should be grateful if you would look into this matter and arrange for the embankment to be tidied and the undergrowth trimmed back.
Scorton is entered both for the 1993 Britain in Bloom and the Best Kept Village competitions.

Application for Entertainments Licence
At their recent meeting Nether Wyresdale Parish Council discussed the application for an entertainments licence by the Priory Restaurant.

Local Government Review
I understand that the Lancashire section of the review of local government is to take place later this year and that it may include the consideration of changes to local government boundaries in this area.
Nether Wyresdale Parish Council has asked me to find out what consultation there will be with Parish Councils and other bodies on this matter.
(At present Nether Wyresdale is administered from Wyre Borough Council based in Poulton-le-Fylde.)
Please can you tell me when and how the Parish Council will be able to make its views known on any proposed boundary changes.
I look forward to hearing from you.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
Copy Letter
Following our telephone conversation today I enclose, as requested, a copy of my letter to Mr Pearson, Lancaster Town Clerk, regarding the forthcoming Local Government Reorganisation.
I also enclose a copy of my letter to the Local Government Commission asking for information on what opportunities there will be for Parish Councils to make their views known on any proposed boundary changes.
As you will appreciate, my main concern is to ensure that the Parish Council has a chance to comment on any changes.
I don't yet know what their comments will be and I ‘m not trying to influence them in one direction or another.
I will, however, bring to their attention your offer of a talk on this matter.
Yours sincerely

Removal of Public Seat, Snowhill, Scorton
In 1990 a public seat provided by Wyre Borough Council was sited on Snowhill Scorton just to the east of the motorway bridge.
The understanding was that the Borough Council provided and installed this seat and the Parish Council was then responsible for its maintenance.
Recently a firm of contractors employed by Lancashire County Council have been at work erecting an AONB Forest of Bowland boundary plinth and sign in the vicinity.
While this work was going on it was observed by two Parish Councillors that the concrete holding the seat in place had been smashed and the seat itself removed.
It appeared to the Parish Councillors that the seat had been removed in conjunction with work taking place on the plinth as if to be re-sited further up the hill.
According to information received by one of the councillors who contacted your office by phone the re-siting of the seat was not part of the contract.
Fearing that the seat might be stolen the councillors arranged for it to be taken away for safe-keeping.
The Parish Council would be grateful if you could confirm that your contractors had no instructions to remove the seat.
Please could you take this matter up with them as a matter of urgency and arrange for the seat to be re-instated.
If you let me know the outcome of your enquiries we can arrange for the seat to be returned to Snowhill for reinstatement.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
Removal of Public Seat, Snowhill, Scorton
In 1990 a public seat provided by Wyre Borough Council was sited on Snowhill Scorton just to the east of the motorway bridge.
The understanding was that the Borough Council provided and installed this seat and the Parish Council was then responsible for its maintenance.
Recently a firm of contractors employed by Lancashire County Council have been at work erecting an AONB Forest of Bowland boundary plinth and sign in the vicinity.
While this work was going on it was observed by two Parish Councillors that the concrete holding the seat in place had been smashed and the seat itself removed.
It appeared to the Parish Councillors that the seat had been removed in conjunction with work taking place on the plinth as if to be re-sited further up the hill.
According to information received by one of the councillors who contacted the County Highways office by phone no instructions had been issued for the re-siting of the seat.
Fearing that the seat might be stolen the councillors arranged for it to be taken away for safe-keeping.
The original enquiries about this were directed to the County Surveyor's Department, but I now understand that the work on the boundary sign was done on behalf of the County Planning Department.
The Parish Council would be grateful if you could confirm that your contractors had no instructions to remove the seat.
Please could you take this matter up with them as a matter of urgency and arrange for the seat to be re-instated.
If you let me know the outcome of your enquiries we can arrange for the seat to be returned to Snowhill for reinstatement.
Yours sincerely

Application 02/93/0378 Extension Slean End Farm
Thank you sending the Nether Wyresdale Parish Council a copy of the above application.
The Parish Councillors made the point that possibly the size of the proposed extension was outside the guidelines laid down by Wyre Borough Council for extensions to rural dwellings.
Apart from this, there were no objections to the development.
Yours sincerely

My phone number at work is 0524 593786 from 10 am — 4 pm except Wednesdays.
I look forward to meeting you in June.

Dear 
Request for Estimate
As you may know the public seat on Snowhill has recently been removed from its base, as far as we can tell by vandals intent on stealing it.
The seat was left further along Snowhill and was taken to Miss Robinson's for safe-keeping.
The Parish Council have asked me to get an estimate from you for replacing the seat in its original position and concreting it in place.
As it is getting towards summer they would like the work done as soon as possible and subject to a satisfactory estimate I can authorise you to carry out the work.
Seat Outside Kettlewell
The Parish Council are also responsible for the upkeep of the public seat in the Square outside Kettlewell.
This is getting a bit dilapidated and needs straightening up.
Please could you let me have a separate estimate for straightening this and doing any necessary repairs to the seat.
It looks as though this would involve quite a bit more work than the seat on Snowhill and I would need to put your estimate to the next meeting of the Parish Council on Thursday 17th June.
I look forward to hearing from you.
Yours sincerely

Dear 
Parish Council Skip Provision 1993/94
Thank you for your letter of 26 April about the location of parish council skips.
The skip provided from 30th March — 6th April 1993 was placed in the area known as the Mill Yard,(or the Dairy Yard) off Station Lane Scorton.
The approximate Grid Ref is SD 501 489.
This site has been used for the past couple of years without any problems.
The site is not in public ownership and any use of it depends on the agreement of the landowner, Mr Whewell.
This permission has been readily given in the past.
However plans have been approved for the residential development of the Mill Yard and it is possible that by March/April 94 work may be in progress and we may not be able to use this site.
All I can do is let you know nearer the time if this is the case.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
Flood Bank Gubberford Lane Scorton
In my letter dated 3rd February 93 to your predecessor I drew attention to the road works on the west side of Gubberford Lane Scorton just south of the railway bridge.
The work now seems to be completed.
However there is still a section at the end of the footway and before the start of the flood bank where there are just two fences a couple of feet apart with nothing between them.
This is on a dangerous bend where pedestrians have to walk on the carriageway.
At the recent Annual Parish Meeting of Nether Wyresdale I was asked to press for the extension of the pavement at least as far at the end of the existing hedge.
Please would you look into this and see what can be done.
It would be a relatively minor piece of work and could avoid accidents and even save lives.
As you will know the local residents and visitors have been pressing for a footpath along Gubberford Lane for many years.
The requests have always been turned down usually for financial reasons.
But even this small addition to the scrap of footway by the bridge would be very welcome.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
Yellow Lines Snowhill Scorton
At the recent meeting of Nether Wyresdale Parish Council I was asked to contact you about the parking restrictions on Snowhill, Scorton outside St Mary and St James RC church.
The yellow lines mean that during that part of the year when they apply — the summer months — people attending services are not allowed to park outside the church and presumably the restrictions would apply to hearses and wedding cars as well.
The points were made that parking there cannot be dangerous as it is permitted during part of the year, and that the authorities seem to have turned a blind eye to cars parked outside the church during services.
Please could you look into this and reassess the need for parking restrictions on this particular section of the highway.
Yours sincerely

Station Lane, Cabus
At the recent Annual Meeting of Nether Wyresdale Parish concern was expressed about the state of the old stable yard at the end of Station Lane near the Little Chef.
It was felt that this small portion of Station Lane made a poor impression on visitors approaching Scorton.
As this area is in Cabus Parish I have been asked to contact you to see if your council can do anything about this matter.
I look forward to hearing from you.

Letting of Scorton C E School — Nether Wyresdale Parish Council Meetings
Thank you for your phone call today.
I enclose the completed form that you mentioned for hire of the school classroom for Parish Council meetings.
I confirm these will usually be every six weeks on Thursdays from 7.30 to 9.30 p.m.
(Very occasionally we have a meeting that goes on later than this and if/when this happens I'll let you know afterwards.)
The meeting booked for 20th May is a one-off to discuss one item only and isn't part of the normal sequence.
We'll also be looking for another extra meeting probably in the week beginning 24th May — sorry about this, I only found out this afternoon.
This will be a meeting to discuss the provision of low cost housing in and it will be more of a committee meeting with representatives from the Parish Council, the PCC, Wyre Borough and one of the housing associations.
It won't be open to the general public.
I'll ring you as soon as I've got a definite date for this.
Yours sincerely

Dear 
Footway Station Lane, Scorton
At the recent meeting of Nether Wyresdale Parish Council attention was drawn to the overgrown state of the footway on Station Lane Scorton on the section from the entrance to Brook Avenue as far as the railway bridge.
Grass and weeds are growing onto the footway and making it impossible for parents with pushchairs to use if.
This route is often used by visitors to the caravan site at Six Arches.
Some of these visitors will be unaccustomed to country roads and to the hazards of walking along a road with no footpath.
In the interests of road safety please could you look into this matter and take appropriate action.
Many thanks.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
Flood Bank Gubberford Lane, Scorton
I enclose copies of my letter to Lancashire County Surveyor and Bridgemaster and the reply I received.
Both letters refer to a small section of between the end of the footway and the start of the flood bank proper.
I also enclose a sketch map showing the exact location.
Would you please let me know if you own this land or any other land along the Gubberford Lane frontage.
As you may remember when the flood bank was built the local residents were very disappointed that Lancashire County Council could not see their way to install a footway along or beside the flood bank.
I note that now they have offered to construct a footway along this small section if you will dedicate the land to them for this purpose.
As I mention in my letter, a footway along this section it could help to avoid accidents and even save lives.
Please give this favourable consideration.
I look forward to hearing from you.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
Low Cost Housing — Sub-committee
As you know St Peter's PCC recently carried out a housing needs survey in Scorton.
The findings from this were accepted both by Nether Wyresdale PC and Wyre BC as showing that there is a need for affordable housing in the village.
On Thursday 27the May representatives of the PCC and the PC together with Mrs D Bellinger from WBC and Ms K Scivyer of the Rural Housing Trust held a meeting to discuss the next steps.
It was agreed at this meeting that a Housing Sub-committee should be set up consisting of two representatives from the PC, two from the PCC and two other local people to be co-opted.
The committee wanted people with a good knowledge of the village and its residents.
Your name was put forward and I'd be delighted if you would agree to be co-opted.
The next meeting of the sub-committee is on Monday 21st June in the school at 7.30 p.m.
Please let me know if you agree to serve on the sub-committee.
Many thanks — in advance!

Dear Sir
Application for a Justices' On Licence The Priory Scorton
Further to our telephone conversation today concerning the above.
I have now discussed the matter with our Chairman and three other Councillors and serious concern had been expressed about the implications and apparent lack of information and consultation on such an important issue.
On seeking advice regarding the application I was originally informed that it was ‘merely an extension of the existing ‘Table Licence’ to incorporate recently acquired adjacent premises'.
It now transpires that this advice was totally inaccurate.
Bearing in mind the well-documented history on the question of having a fully-licensed establishment within our village the Chairman of the Council has asked me to request a postponement of any final decision in order to give time and opportunity for full consultation and for any resulting meaningful comments to be submitted.
Yours faithfullly
Dear 
You are cordially invited to attend the next meeting of Nether Wyresdale Parish Council on Thursday 17th June in School at 7.30 p.m.
I hope you will be able to come.

Dear 
Overgrown Footway Station Lane, Scorton
Further to my letter of 23rd May and our telephone conversation yesterday it now seems that most of the verges and hedge-bottoms in the Scorton area have been trimmed EXCEPT for the section of Station Lane from opposite Brook Avenue as far as the railway bridge.
This is the part where there is a surfaced footway or pavement but at present it is so overgrown that pedestrians have to walk on the road.
Yesterday you mentioned that your contractors work to a pre-arranged schedule and it seems possible that they have accidentally omitted this stretch of Station Lane.
Please could you look into this matter and see what can be done to remedy the situation.
Many thanks
Yours sincerely

At their recent meeting Nether Wyresdale Parish Council asked me to write and thank you for allowing the seat from Snowhill to be kept on your property after it had been removed from its base.
It was most kind and public-spirited of you to look after the seat for us in this way.
I hope it didn't cause you too much inconvenience.
As you will know Councillor Wiper and Councillor Gornall have now replaced the seat and fixed it in position on Snowhill.
Once again, many thanks for your help.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
Overgrown Hedges
At the recent meeting of Nether Wyresdale Parish Council the matter of overgrown hedges was mentioned.
In particular the hedge on the Trough Road near the Cut and the section of Gubberford Lane on the West side near Gubberford Bridge were mentioned as encroaching onto the carriageway and in need of cutting back.
I understand both these belong to Wyresdale Park Estates and I should be very grateful if you could look into the matter and arrange to have them trimmed.
Could I also ask you to ensure that the debris from the hedge-cutting is removed from the highway and not left as a hazard to cyclists.
As you will be aware Scorton attracts many visitors and a fair number travel by bicycle — as do some of the local residents!
Many thanks.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
Footway Gubberford Lane
I refer to my letter of 5th May and your reply of 17th May on the matter of a section of land on Gubberford Lane.
I have been in touch with the National Rivers Authority and I enclose a copy of their letter to me.
I should like to mention again that the recent excavations at this point removed 5–6 metres of tarmac surface and replaced this with two fences a couple of feet apart with nothing between them.
At the recent meeting of Nether Wyresdale Parish Council I was asked to write to you again about this and to suggest that you come and assess the situation on site with a view to arranging for a footway to be constructed.
Yours sincerely
