SCHOOLS
Halfway Street, Sidcup
‘We did sums at school, Mummy —
you do them like this: look.’
I showed her.
It turned out she knew already.
St Gertrude's, Sidcup
Nuns, now: ladies in black hoods
for teachers — surely that was surprising?
It seems not.
It was just England:
like houses made of brick, with stairs,
and dark skies, and Christmas coming
in winter, and there being a war on.
I was five, and unsurprisable —
except by nasty dogs, or the time
when I ran to catch the bus from school
and my knickers fell down in the snow.
Scalford School
The French boy was sick on the floor at prayers.
For years his name made me feel sick too:
Maurice.
The teachers said it the English way,
but he was French, or French-speaking —
Belgian, perhaps; at any rate from some


country where things were wrong in 1940.
Until I grew up, ‘Maurice’ meant
his narrow pale face, pointed chin,
bony legs, and the wet pink sick.
But we were foreign too, of course,
my sister and I, in spite of our
unthinkingly acquired Leicestershire accents.
An older girl was struck one day
by our, to us, quite ordinary noses;
made an anthropological deduction:
‘Have all the other people in New Zealand
got silly little noses too?’
I couldn't remember.
Firmly I said ‘Yes.’
Salfords, Surrey
Forget about the school — there was one,
which I've near enough forgotten.
But look at this — and you still can,
on the corner of Honeycrock Lane
this tiny tin-roofed shed of brick,
once the smallest possible Public
Library.
I used to lie
flat on the floor, and work my way
along the shelves, trying to choose
between Rose Fyleman's fairy verse
and Tales of Sir Benjamin Bulbous, Bart.
The book that really stuck in my heart
I can't identify: a saga
about a talking horse, the Pooka,


and Kathleen, and the quest they both
made through tunnels under the earth
for — something.
Herbs and flowers came
into it, spangled through a dream
of eyebright, speedwell, Kathleen's bare
legs blotched blue with cold.
Well; there
were other stories.
When I'd read
all mine I'd see what Mummy had.
Of Mice and Men: that sounded nice.
I'd just got far enough to notice
it wasn't much like Peter Rabbit
when she took it away and hid it.
No loss, I'd say.
But where shall I find
the Pooka's travels underground?
Outwood
Milkmaids, buttercups, ox-eye daisies,
white and yellow in the tall grass:
I fought my way to school through flowers —
bird's-foot trefoil, clover, vetch —
my sandals all smudged with pollen,
seedy grass-heads caught in my socks.
At school I used to read, mostly,
and hide in the shed at dinnertime,
writing poems in my notebook.
‘Little fairies dancing’, I wrote,
and ‘Peter and I, we watch the birds fly,
high in the sky, in the evening.’


Then home across the warm common
to tease my little sister again:
‘I suppose you thought I'd been to school:
I've been to work in a bicycle shop.’
Mummy went to a real job
every day, on a real bicycle;
Doris used to look after us.
She took us for a walk with a soldier,
through the damp ferns in the wood
into a clearing like a garden,
rosy-pink with beds of campion,
herb-robert, lady's smock.
The blackberry briars were pale with blossom.
I snagged my tussore dress on a thorn;
Doris didn't even notice.
She and the soldier lay on the grass;
he leaned over her pink blouse and
their voices went soft and round, like petals.
On the School Bus
The little girls in the velvet collars
(twins, we thought) had lost their mother:
the ambulance men had had to scrape her
off the road, said the sickening whispers.
Horror's catching.
The safe procedure
to ward it off, or so we gathered,
was a homeopathic dose of torture.
So we pulled their hair, like all the others.
Earlswood
Air-raid shelters at school were damp tunnels
where you sang ‘Ten Green Bottles’ yet again
and might as well have been doing decimals.


At home, though, it was cosier and more fun:
cocoa and toast inside the Table Shelter,
our iron-panelled bunker, our new den.
By day we ate off it; at night you'd find us
under it, the floor plump with mattresses
and the wire grilles neatly latched around us.
You had to be careful not to bump your head;
we padded the hard metal bits with pillows,
then giggled in our glorious social bed.
What could be safer?
What could be more romantic
than playing cards by torchlight in a raid?
Odd that it made our mother so neurotic
to hear the sirens; we were quite content —
but slightly cramped once there were four of us,
after we'd taken in old Mrs Brent
from down by the Nag's Head, who'd been bombed out.
She had her arm in plaster, but she managed
to dress herself, and smiled, and seemed all right.
Perhaps I just imagined hearing her
moaning a little in the night, and shaking
splinters of glass out of her long grey hair.
The next week we were sent to Leicestershire.
Scalford Again
Being in Mr Wood's class this time,
and understanding, when he explained it clearly,
about the outside of a bicycle wheel
travelling around faster than the centre;
and not minding his warts; and liking Scripture
because of the Psalms: I basked in all this
no less than in the Infants the time before,


with tambourines and Milly-Molly-Mandy.
Although I'd enjoyed Milly-Molly-Mandy:
it had something to do with apricots, I thought,
or marigolds; or some warm orange glow.
Neston
Just visiting: another village school
with a desk for me to fill, while Chippenham
decided whether it wanted me — too young
for there, too over-qualified for here.
I knew it all — except, of course, geography.
Here was a map; I vaguely scratched in towns.
Ah, but here was a job: the infant teacher
was called away for half an hour.
Would I…?
Marooned there in a tide of little bodies
alive with Wiltshire voices, I was dumb.
They skipped about my feet, a flock of lambs
bleating around a daft young heifer.
Chippenham
The maths master was eight feet tall.
He jabbed his clothes'-prop arm at me
halfway across the classroom, stretched
his knobbly finger, shouted ‘You!
You're only here one day in three,
and when you are you might as 
not be, for all the work you do!
What do you think you're playing at?’
What did I think?
I shrank into
my grubby blouse.
Who did I think
I was, among these blazered boys,
these tidy girls in olive serge?


My green skirt wasn't uniform:
clothes were on coupons, after all.
I'd get a gymslip — blue, not green —
for Redhill Grammar, some time soon
when we went home.
But, just for now,
what did I think?
I thought I was
betrayed.
I thought of how I'd stood
an hour waiting for the bus
that morning, by a flooded field,
watching the grass-blades drift and sway
beneath the water like wet hair;
hoping for Mrs Johnson's call:
‘Jean, are you there?
The clock was wrong.
You've missed the bus.’
And back I'd run
to change my clothes, be Jean again,
play with the baby, carry pails
of water from the village tap,
go to the shop, eat toast and jam,
and then, if she could shake enough
pennies and farthings from her bag,
we might get to the pictures.
But
the clock was fast, it seemed, not slow;
the bus arrived; and as I slid
anonymously into it
an elegant male prefect said
‘Let Fleur sit down, she's got bad feet.’
I felt my impetigo scabs
blaze through my shoes.
How did he know?
Tunbridge Wells
My turn for Audrey Pomegranate,
all-purpose friend for newcomers;
the rest had had enough of her —
her too-much hair, her too-much flesh,
her moles, her sideways-gliding mouth,
her smirking knowledge about rabbits.
Better a gluey friend than none,
and who was I to pick and choose?
She nearly stuck; but just in time
I met a girl called Mary Button,
a neat Dutch doll as clean as soap,
and Audrey P. was back on offer.
The High Tree
There was a tree higher than clouds or lightning,
higher than any plane could fly.
England huddled under its roots; leaves from it
fluttered on Europe out of the sky.
The weather missed it: it was higher than weather,
up in the sunshine, always dry.
It was a refuge.
When you sat in its branches
threatening strangers passed you by.
Nothing could find you.
Even friendly people,
if you invited them to try,
couldn't climb very far.
It made them dizzy:
they'd shiver and shut their eyes and cry,
and you'd have to guide them down again, backwards,
wishing they hadn't climbed so high.
So it wasn't a social tree.
It was perfect
for someone solitary and shy
who liked gazing out over miles of history,
watching it happen, like a spy,
and was casual about heights, but didn't fancy
coming down again to defy
the powers below.
Odd that they didn't notice
all this climbing on the sly,
and odder still, if they knew, that they didn't ban it.
Knowing them now, you'd wonder why.
TELLING TALES
Drowning
‘Si qua mulier maritum suum, cui legitime est iuncta, dimiserit, necetur in luto’— Lex Burgund., 34, I.
(If any woman has killed her lawfully married husband let her be drowned in mud.)
Death by drowning drowns the soul:
bubbles cannot carry it;
frail pops of air, farts
loosed in water are no vessels
for the immortal part of us.
And in a pit of mud, what bubbles?
There she lies, her last breath with her,
her soul rotting in her breast.
Is the sea better, then?
Will the salty brine preserve
pickled souls for the Day of Judgement?
Are we herrings to be trawled
in long nets by Saint Peter?
Ocean is a heavy load:
My soul flies up to thee, O God —
but not through mud, not through water.
And so, Bishop Synesius,
how can you wonder that we stand
with drawn swords on this bucking deck,
choosing to fall on friendly steel
and squirt our souls into the heavens
rather than choke them fathoms deep?


One more lash of the storm and it's done:
self-murder, but not soul-murder.
Then let the fishes feast on us
and slurp our blood after we're finished:
they'll find no souls to suck from us.
Yours, perhaps, has a safe-conduct:
you're a bishop, and subtle, and Greek.
Well, sir, pray and ponder.
But our
language has no word for dilemma.
Drowning's the strongest word for death.
‘Personal Poem ‘
It's the old story of the personal;
or of the Person —‘Al’, we could call him —
with his oneness, his centrality,
fingers tapping to the band music,
and his eyes glowing like that
as if he had invented the guitar;
or coming around the corner on his tractor
calling out some comment you just missed.
The radios begin at 6 a.m.
It is really a very crowded city.
You're lucky to find two rooms, one for sleeping,
and a patch of allotment for potatoes.
Here we are on the hills, and it's no better.
Of course the birds are singing, but they would.
All you get is contempt, didn't they say so?
All right, contemn us.
We asked for nothing but a few gestures —
that kiss inside his open collar,
between the neck and shoulder, shockingly
personal to watch.
It's Al again, laughing in his teeth,
telling us about his Jamaican childhood
and the time his friend had crabs
from making love to the teacher's maid.
‘It gave me a funny feeling’ he says
‘to see them crawling there, little animals.
I hadn't even grown hair on mine.
In a way I was jealous —
imagine!’
We imagine.
All these people running about in tracksuits
for nothing.
And one standing at the gate
with a paper bag of bananas.
‘Hi’ he says,
‘How are you?’
Nobody answers.


So at the May Day rally there they are.
Surely that's his jacket she's wearing?
And the face under the hair is his,
the way she wrinkles her nose.
How people give themselves away!
Yet all we have is hearsay.
Too late to take a boat out;
and anyway, the lake's crowded,
kids and oars together, and all their voices
But really no one in particular,
unless you say so.
Unless we say so.
An Epitaph
I wish to apologize for being mangled.
It was the romantic temperament
that did for me.
I could stand rejection —
so grand, ‘the stone the builders rejected…‘but not acceptance.
‘Alas’, I said
(a word I use), ‘alas, I am taken
up, or in, or out of myself:
shall I never be solitary?’
Acceptance fell on me like a sandbag.
My bones crack.
It squelches out of them.
Ah, acceptance!
Leave me under this stone.
Being Taken from the Place
Less like an aircraft than a kettle,
this van, the way the floor buzzes
tinnily over its boiling wheels,
rolling me south.
Sounds flick backwards
in a travelling cauldron of noise.
I lie
on the metal floor, hearing their voices
whirring like mechanical flies
over the seething burr of the engine.
They won't hear if I talk to myself;
whatever I say they can't hear me.
I say ‘Illness is a kind of failure.’
I say ‘Northumbrian rose quartz.’
Accidents
The accidents are never happening:
they are too imaginable to be true.
The driver knows his car is still on the road,
heading for Durham in the rain.
The mother knows her baby is just asleep,
curled up with his cuddly blanket, waiting
to be lifted and fed: there's no such thing as cot-death.
The rescue party digging all night in the dunes
can't believe the tunnel has really collapsed:
the children have somehow gone to their Auntie's house;
she has lent them their cousins' pyjamas, they are sitting
giggling together in the big spare room,
pretending to try and spill each other 's cocoa.
On the Land
I'm still too young to remember how
I learned to mind a team of horses,
to plough and harrow: not a knack
you'd lose easily, once you had it.
It was in the Great War, that much —
remembered age.
I was a landgirl
in my puttees and boots and breeches
and a round hat like a felt halo.
We didn't mind the lads laughing:
let them while they could, we thought,
they hadn't long.
But it seemed long —
hay-making, and apple-picking,
and storing all those scented things
in sneezy dimness in the barn.
Then Jack turned seventeen and went,
and I knew Ted would go soon.
He went the week of Candlemas.
After that it was all weather:
frosts and rains and spring and summer,
and the long days growing longer.
It rained for the potato harvest.
The front of my smock hung heavy
with claggy mud, from kneeling in it
mining for strays.
Round segments
chopped clean off by the blade
flashed white as severed kneecaps.
I grubbed for whole ones, baby skulls
to fill my sack again and again.


When the pain came, it wouldn't stop.
I couldn't stand.
I dropped
the sack and sank into a trench.
Ethel found me doubled up.
Mr Gregson took me home,
jolting on the back of the wagon.
I tossed and writhed on my hard bed,
my head hunched into the bolster,
dreaming of how if just for once,
for half an hour, the knobbly mattress
could turn into a billow of clouds
I might be able to get to sleep.
Icon
In the interests of economy
I am not going to tell you
what happened between the time
when they checked into the hotel
with its acres of tiled bathrooms
(but the bidet in theirs was cracked)
and the morning two days later
when he awoke to find her gone.
After he had read her note
and done the brief things he could do
he found himself crossing the square
to the Orthodox Cathedral.
The dark icon by the door
was patched with lumpy silver islands
nailed to the Virgin's robes; they looked
like flattened-out Monopoly tokens,
he thought: a boot, and something like
a heart, and a pair of wings, and something
oblong.
They were hard to see
in the brown light, but he peered at them
for several minutes, leaning over
the scarved head of an old woman
on her knees there, blocking his view,
who prayed and prayed and wouldn't move.
Drawings
The ones not in the catalogue:
little sketches, done in her garden — this
head of a child (the same child
we saw in the picnic scene, remember?)
And trees, of course, and grasses,
and a study of hawthorn berries.
Doodles, unfinished drafts: look
at this chestnut leaf, abandoned in mid —
stroke — a telephone-call, perhaps;
a visitor; some interruption.
She may have been happier,
or happy longer, or at least more often…
but that's presumption.
Let's move on:
grasses again; a group of stones
from her rockery, done in charcoal; and this
not quite completed pencil sketch of
a tiger lily, the springy crown
of petals curved back on itself
right to the stem, the long electric
stamens almost still vibrating.
The Telephone Call
They asked me ‘Are you sitting down?
Right?
This is Universal Lotteries’,
they said.
‘You've won the top prize,
the Ultra-super Global Special.
What would you do with a million pounds?
Or, actually, with more than a million —
not that it makes a lot of difference
once you're a millionaire.’
And they laughed.
‘Are you OK?’ they asked —‘Still there?
Come on, now, tell us, how does it feel?’
I said ‘I just…
I can't believe it!’
They said ‘That's what they all say.
What else?
Go on, tell us about it.’
I said ‘I feel the top of my head
has floated off, out through the window,
revolving like a flying saucer.’
‘That's unusual’ they said.
‘Go on.’
I said ‘I'm finding it hard to talk.
My throat's gone dry, my nose is tingling.
I think I'm going to sneeze — or cry.’
‘That's right’ they said, ‘don't be ashamed
of giving way to your emotions.
It isn't every day you hear
you're going to get a million pounds.
Relax, now, have a little cry;
we'll give you a moment…
’‘Hang on!’
I said.
‘I haven't bought a lottery ticket
for years and years.
And what did you say
the company's called?’
They laughed again.
‘Not to worry about a ticket.
We're Universal.
We operate
a Retrospective Chances Module.


Nearly everyone's bought a ticket
in some lottery or another,
once at least.
We buy up the files,
feed the names into our computer,
and see who the lucky person is.’
‘Well, that's incredible’ I said.
‘It's marvellous.
I still can't quite…
I'll believe it when I see the cheque.’
‘Oh,’ they said, ‘there's no cheque.’
‘But the money?
‘We don't deal in money.
Experiences are what we deal in.
You've had a great experience, right?
Exciting?
Something you'll remember?
That's your prize.
So congratulations
from all of us at Universal.
Have a nice day!’
And the line went dead.
INCIDENTALS
Excavations
Here is a hole full of men shouting
‘I don't love you.
I loved you once
but I don't now.
I went off you,
or I was frightened, or my wife was pregnant,
or I found I preferred men instead.’
What can I say to that kind of talk?
‘Thank you for being honest, you
who were so shifty when it happened,
pretending you were suddenly busy
with your new job or your new conscience.’
I chuck them a shovelful of earth
to make them blink for a bit, to smirch
their green eyes and their long lashes
or their brown eyes…
Pretty bastards:
the rain will wash their bawling faces
and I bear them little enough ill will.
Now on to the next hole,
covered and fairly well stamped down,
full of the men whom I stopped loving
and didn't always tell at the time
being, I found, rather busy
with my new man or my new freedom.
These are quiet and unaccusing,
cuddled up with their subsequent ladies,
hardly unsettling the bumpy ground.
Pastoral
Eat their own hair, sheep do,
nibbling away under the snow, under their bellies —
calling it wool makes it no more palatable.
What else is there to do in the big drifts,
forced against a wall of wet stone?
But let me have your hair to nibble
before we are in winter; and the thong
of dark seeds you wear at your neck;
and for my tongue the salt on your skin to gobble.
Kissing
The young are walking on the riverbank,
arms around each other 's waists and shoulders,
pretending to be looking at the  waterlilies 
and what might be a nest of some kind, over
there, which two who are clamped together
mouth to mouth have forgotten about.
The others, making courteous detours
around them, talk, stop talking, kiss.
They can see no one older than themselves.
It's their river.
They've got all day.
Seeing's not everything.
At this very
moment the middle-aged are kissing
in the backs of taxis, on the way
to airports and stations.
Their mouths and tongues
are soft and powerful and as moist as ever.
Their hands are not inside each other 's clothes
(because of the driver) but locked so tightly
together that it hurts: it may leave marks
on their not of course youthful skin, which they won't
notice.
They too may have futures.
Double-Take
You see your next-door neighbour from above,
from an upstairs window, and he reminds you
of your ex-lover, who is bald on top,
which you had forgotten.
At ground level
there is no resemblance.
Next time you chat
with your next-door neighbour, you are relieved
to find that you don't fancy him.
A week later you meet your ex-lover
at a party, after more than a year.
He reminds you (although only slightly)
of your next-door neighbour.
He has a paunch
like your neighbour's before he went on that diet.
You remember how much you despise him.
He behaves as if he's pleased to see you.
When you leave (a little earlier
than you'd intended, to get away)
he gives you a kiss which is more than neighbourly
and says he'll ring you.
He seems to mean it.
How odd!
But you are quite relieved
to find that you don't fancy him.
Unless you do?
Or why that sudden
something, once you get outside
in the air?
Why are your legs prancing
so cheerfully along the pavement?
And what exactly have you just remembered?
You go home cursing chemistry.
Choices
There was never just one book for the desert island,
one perfectly tissue-typed aesthetic match,
that wouldn't drive you crazy within six months;
just as there was never one all-purpose
ideal outfit, unquestionably right
for wearing at the ball on the Titanic
and also in the lifeboat afterwards.
And never, a fortiori, just one man;
if it's not their conversation or their habits
(more irritating, even, than your own —
and who would you wish those on?) it's their bodies:
two-thirds of them get fatter by the minute,
the bony ones turn out to be psychopaths,
and the few in the middle range go bald.
Somehow you'll end up there, on the island,
in your old jeans and that comic dressing-gown
one of the fast-fatteners always laughed at,
with a blank notebook (all you've brought to read)
and a sea-and-sun-proof crate of cigarettes;
but with nobody, thank God, to lecture you
on how he managed to give them up.
THATCHERLAND
Street Scene, London N2
This is the front door.
You can just see
the number on it, there behind the piano,
between the young man with the fierce expression
and the one with the axe, who's trying not to laugh.
Those furry-headed plants beside the step
are Michaelmas daisies, as perhaps you've guessed,
although they're not in colour; and the path
is tiled in red and black, like a Dutch interior.
But the photograph, of course, is black and white.
The piano also sported black and white
when it was whole (look, you can see its ribcage,
the wiry harp inside it, a spread wing.)
The young men are playing Laurel and Hardy
(though both are tall, and neither of them is fat,
and one of them is actually a pianist):
they are committing a  pianocide .
It wasn't really much of a piano:
warped and fungoid, grossly out of tune —
facts they have not imparted to the wincing
passers-by, whom you will have to imagine.
You will also have to imagine, if you dare,
the jangling chords of axe-blow, saw-stroke, screeching
timber, wires twanged in a terminal
appassionato.
This is a silent picture.


Laurel and Hardy will complete their show:
the wires, released from their frame, will thrash and tangle
and be tamed into a ball; the varnished panels
will be sawn stacks of boards and blocks and kindling.
Later the mother will come home for Christmas.
The fire will purr and tinkle in the grate,
a chromatic harmony of tones; and somewhere
there'll he a muffled sack of snarling keys.
Gentlemen's Hairdressers
The barbers' shop has gone anonymous:
white paint, glossy as Brilliantine
(‘The Perfect Hairdressing’) has covered
Jim's and Alfred's friendly monickers.
 GENTLEMENS HAIRD in chaste blue Roman
glorifies pure form.
The man
on the ladder lays a scarlet slash
of marking-tape for the next upright.
Below him Jim and Alfred are still
in business.
Alfred munches a pie
and dusts the crumbs from his grey moustache
over the racing-page.
A gentleman
tilts his head under Jim's clippers.
In the window the Durex poster,
the one with the motorbike, has faded
to pale northern shades of sea.
An hour later the ladder's gone
and purity's been deposed: the lettering's
denser now, the Roman caps
blocked in with three-dimensional grey.
The word ‘Styling’ in shapeless cursive
wriggles above the open door.
Swaddled and perched on Alfred's chair
a tiny Greek boy squeals and squeals.
Post Office
The queue's right out through the glass doors
to the street: Thursday, pension day.
They built this Post Office too small.
Of course, the previous one was smaller —
a tiny prefab, next to the betting-shop,
says the man who's just arrived;
and the present one, at which we're queuing,
was cherry-trees in front of a church.
The church was where the supermarket is:
‘My wife and I got married in that church’
the man says.
‘We hold hands sometimes
when we're standing waiting at the checkout —
have a little moment together!’
He laughs.
The queue shuffles forward a step.
Three members of it silently vow
never to grow old in this suburb;
one vows never to grow old at all.
‘I first met her over there’ the man says,
‘on that corner where the bank is now.
The other corner was Williams Brothers —
remember Williams Brothers?
They gave you tokens,
tin money, like, for your dividend.’
The woman in front of him remembers.
She nods, and swivels her loose lower denture,
remembering Williams Brothers' metal tokens,
and the marble slab on the cheese-counter,
and the carved mahogany booth where you went to pay.
The boy in front of her is chewing gum;
his jaws rotate with the same motion
as hers: to and fro, to and fro .
Demonstration
‘YOU ARE NOW WALKING IN THE ROAD.
The lines marked out with sticky tape
are where the kerb is going to be
under the traffic-scheme proposals.
This tree will go.
The flower-beds
and seats outside the supermarket
will go.
The pavements will be narrowed
to make room for six lanes of traffic.’
We are now walking in the road
with a few banners and some leaflets
and forms to sign for a petition.
The Council will ignore them all.
The Council wants a monster junction
with traffic-islands, metal railings,
computer-managed lights and crossings,
and lots and lots of lanes of traffic.
We are still walking in the road.
It seems a long time since we started,
and most of us are getting older
(the ones who aren't, of course, are dead.)
This borough has the highest number
of pensioners in Greater London.
Perhaps the junction, with its modern
split-second lights, will cut them down.
But while we're walking in the road
others are driving.
At our backs
we hear the roar of heavy traffic
churning from Finchley to Westminster;
and over it, from a loudspeaker,
a stern, conceited female voice
with artificial vowels exhorts us:
‘Come with us into the nineties!’
Witnesses
We three in our dark decent clothes,
unlike ourselves, more like the three
witches, we say, crouched over the only
ashtray, smoke floating into our hair,
wait.
An hour; another hour.
If you stand up and walk ten steps
to the glass doors you can see her there
in the witness box, a Joan of Arc,
straight, still, her neck slender,
her lips moving from time to time 
in reply to voices we can't hear:
‘I put it to you…
I should like to suggest…’
It's her small child who is at stake.
His future hangs from these black-clad
proceedings, these ferretings under her sober
dress, under our skirts and dresses
to sniff out corruption: ‘I put it to you
that in fact your husband…that my client…
that you yourself initiated the violence…
that your hysteria…
’ She sits like marble.
We pace the corridors, peep at the distance
from door to witness box (two steps up,
remember, be careful not to trip
when the time comes) and imagine them there,
the ones we can't see.
A man in a wig
and black robes.
Two other men
in lesser wigs and gowns.
More men
in dark suits.
We sit down together,
shake the smoke from our hair, pass round
more cigarettes (to be held carefully
so as not to smirch our own meek versions
of their clothing), and wait to be called.
Last Song
Goodbye, sweet symmetry.
Goodbye, sweet world
of mirror-images and matching halves,
where animals have usually four legs
and people nearly always two;
where birds and bats and butterflies and bees
have balanced wings, and even flies
can fly straight if they try.
Goodbye
to one-a-side for eyes and ears and arms
and breasts and balls and shoulder-blades
and hands; goodbye to the straight line
drawn down the central spine,
making us double in a world
where oddness is acceptable only
under the sea, for the lop-sided lobster,
the wonky oyster, the creepily rotated
flatfish with both eyes over one gill;
goodbye to the sweet certitudes of our
mammalian order, where to be
born with one eye or three thumbs
points to not being human.
It will come.
In the next world, when this one's gone skew-whiff,
we shall be algae or lichen, things
we've hardly even needed to pronounce.
If the flounder still exists it will be king.
