Leave one of the little windows open all the time.
We have the door open all night, it's still just as bad.
Just as bad as open or closed.
There's a layer of frost inside and  outside of those windows.
Mm.

I'm hoping it, once it's dried out that'll go down a bit.
Once we've had some fine weather
Yeah.

I think it'll be right until after er  the summer really.
Sally's was months before she put anything 
Was she?
in it.
She was literally months!
And even when she did put furniture in it 
Was hers built in the winter or summer?
A spring I think.
Spring?
See, mine's winter isn't it?
Yeah, so it takes a bit longer 
It's all piled up 
I think hers was built early spring I think.
Yeah.
But yours'll be 
And er 
ready after the summer.
I reckon it's gonna be a, a couple of months before I can put any carpet or anything in.
She  well, she had  to have her tiles  on the floor of hers.
Cos hers was a very 
Mm.
big one and it took  ages to dry off, yeah.
And this morning when we, when we went out there it was just
She had to leave the floor, they had to walk, that's right, they had to walk on the concrete floor without tiles on for a long time
Yeah.
before she could have the tiles put on cos then it had to be skimmed  and then the tiles put on.
Yeah.
But she, you know, it was built for a long time before she got anything in it.
Yeah.

But it looks filthy!
You can see it.
Although it's between the two layers of glass is it?
No.
It's not double glazing.
Stop me borrowing it and .
No, it's on the outside there.
You're nowhere near it yet are you?
It's steamed up between the layers is that what you're looking at.

Terrible innit?
But what do you say?
Well, I'm not going to do it today.
Oh no!
Right.
My go.
That's why I was tempted to have those  Staybrite windows cos it repels all that .
But Tony said they're no safer.
I don't even want that 
 
one.
cos he took a bit of the U P V C 
Kyle!
to work

Is that right?
and Alan says if you can still tell  any of them that way.
 
My go?
So in that 
Yup!

Might just as well.
That's how I felt about it.
Save a thousand pound or summat don't 
You go then.

Two.
Two thousand pound?
I'll soon know when you  Kyle.
It's worth saving innit?
Is the Kingfisher still 
One, two, three, four 
a good price?
Yeah.
Because it's a month since they sent me a quote and actually we want a big one for our lounge but 
Did you see that one advertising triple glazing at the same time as his double would you believe?
I thought, yeah.
I can't see what you paying, why you need triple glazing.
No, not really I suppose.
Be 
I'm not sure what the benefits are.
They have triple glazing in these cold countries don't they?
Is it my go?
Mhm.
Yep.
Erm , Finland and places like Norway, they have triple glazing wouldn't you say?
One
I wouldn't have thought we'd need in this 
three, four.

Right, and I need

Gotta be worth going to hasn't it?
 
Is it, is it warm country, Bulgaria?
I don't know.
Yeah!
It's hot.
It's like Greece, it's the 
Is it?
the same as Greece.
It's very hot.
It's in between Greece and Turkey.
On that 
Well it would be the same climate as Tu , Greece 
Yeah.
then wouldn't it?
Yes.
And most of the food's the same as Greece.
Mm.
Quite beefy and all that.
But it's not hot enough.
It's the same!
But it's not 
It's the same food Kyle!
It's right 
It's not been commercialized though?

No, they said it's er
I think it was communist run, I'm not 
Still not going!

He quite fancies 
It's done it erm

through here and 
Yeah.
and er  more or less 
That was it.
I didn't take any others Kyle.
you could do it , there's only  Bulcan and that
Here, no, look they can do it.
And all the
You've only got 
You finished?
one company that cover Bulgaria.
What would you go, self catering?
All the rest.
Yeah.
Yeah.
All the rest of what?
I mean, it's looks nice
Didn't nick anything else Kyle !
I must admit.
Just one gem  worth the two gold.
And you can fly on a Sunday  from Birmingham 
Yeah.
It's a lot!
to there.
Yeah?
You see a weekend flight is what you want.
Yes, that'll be 
Isn't it?
ideal.
You fly out on the Sunday evening, six thirty.
And how long's the flight, does it say?
Three and a half hours.
So it's the same as Greece.
That's not bad is it?
The villas look nice don't they?
Do, don't they?
I thought it all looked lovely!
Yeah!
The dearest holiday's only three hundred and  compared with the  
Yeah!
as it was.
That's the absolute dearest, you know, for the weeks we're going.
Yeah.
Mm!
Definitely worth thinking about.
Mm!
But definitely worth taking a little visit.
Yeah well if I sit like that.
That's it.
Sh I'd speak to Tony anyway if I was you, just in case.
Gotta have our holidays.
Well that's a lot cheaper than the Jersey and Scottish holidays  that we're looking at !
Exactly!
A lot cheaper.
It's cheaper than staying in England.
Do you wanna take that book and show dad?
Oh!
He wouldn't wanna go!
Especially since the price of the food's so bloody cheap!
He won't wanna go!
Well perhaps you can tell him how, how 
You what he's like!
how much the cigarettes are, he might.
It won't make any difference.
He wouldn't wanna go.
I bet you.
Ca , hmm!
I think once you've had one holiday abroad you know, he'd love it!
He just don't wanna go abroad, you know.
He's so 
I know you would because 
I would like to go abroad, yeah.
But he  he doesn't wanna go abroad and that's it!
Why don't you two just go to Bulgaria then.
Be cheap enough too wouldn't it?
Oh!
There's an idea!
What do we do with the rest of them!
I'll stay with daddy and we go and do
Yeah!
things like
You stay with daddy.
go and , yeah, and we'll go something really 
And take granddad with you.

Yeah.
Me and daddy go to Lindos.

Come back with four hundred and ninety nine !
They're supposed to be a ten each.
Well, each of them 
Ten pounds 
the year before that, it was first 
and I could just  
sort of discovered
Kyle.
 
 
God!
That's where he   !
Yeah, but I don't have to have things off the 
Why don't we pull the curtains.
, right?
Yes.
That's a good idea isn't it?
Oh great!
They've probably got more sense!
Even I'll say that.
Peter's son went to Bulgaria two years ago.
Yeah.
And he was a student at the time and he hadn't got a lot of money  and he took   what was it she said ?
He took all his savings, about three hundred pound with him
and brought hundred and fifty quid home with him !
No.
He said  you know, cos he lived as cheaply as he could while he was out there and 
Yeah.

How long did he stay for?
Fortnight or a
Fortnight?

Yeah.
Eleven o'clock.

He's gonna try but he's not sure if he'll get up in time cos he'll be doing an essay  in the night.
Why do you do it overnight?
Cos he won't have time any other time.
Well he could get up early and do it in the morning.
He'd rather do it at night !
I don't think he'll be in any fit condition to do it every morning anyway.
I certainly wouldn't!
Prefer to do things last thing at night, rather than first thing in the morning.
I'm the other way around.
Much rather  I'm a morning person.
Mm.
I didn't think he was gonna be able to get through cos the phone broke down didn't it?
I thought, oh great, you know!
The one night Dan's  says he's gonna ring here  the phone breaks down!
And erm  it couldn't take incoming calls or outgoing calls.
So how did he get through then?
Well about ten minutes to eleven, cos he was due to ring at eleven, the phone came back on.
Fluke or what?
I think the lines must have been down.
Yeah, out of order.
Tony got up at six in the morning.
Oh great!
Got a lot of work to try and fit in.
Yeah.
I'm not looking forward to this trip at all!
I hate, ahem
Pardon 
er , I hate driving on motorways!
It's only an hour long.
Mm.
It's not like it's a long way.
Yeah.
Cos I don't motorists .
Yeah.
I don't like them, even when Tony's driving.
Mm.
Feels pretty safe doesn't he?
Mind you, I bet you 
Well Tony's a good driver.
It's the other idiots!
It's not  my capability 
Yeah I know.
it's, or, or  my driver's capability that worry me
Yeah er
it's the other idiots, you know, you see some stupid things!
Mhm.
Gold isn't as good as butter.
Tony had it on with this Delight  Clover Light.
Mm.
And I got rather fed up with work last night actually cos  there's a load of  drunken idiots and  chatting me up.
Mm.
Oh well it was your last night, you go back today.
Exactly!
That's the way I kept lo to looking at it.
Well if Dan hadn't rung then I'd have been  extremely fed up.
Weren't on the phone for as long as he is when he rung you here was he?
Well he was ringing from Birmingham, he'd put a pound in, it lasted twenty minutes.
 
that er  normally lasts longer from Birmingham  than it does for  for here.
This is the wrong way round, should have had the grapefruit before the er, egg and bacon.
Yep!
That's the usual way, you know !
I've actually got eight bags and erm, three boxes.
Mind you, the problem is, that they're small bags you see, and I haven't got many big bags left after  Thursday.
I'm tempted to get another box and put several of the small bags in it, so it'd be less to carry but I couldn't get a box that was big enough.
You know, I was gonna get a deep one.
But I'll just  well  they both wanted to go to the car.
Yeah.
I've gotta have a bag.
Last night as I'm going to sleep all I could smell was like ashtray, you know!
Urgh!
Horrible !
It really is !
The smell gets into your hair.
Yep!
Your hair, under your skin, up your nails, everywhere!
In your clothes.
Mm.
Glad I've finished there.
Oh dear .
There's something wrong with that, with that  if you can't even
Have you ?
Still that's why you go to sleep  cos it does knock you out.
I find it helps me sleep in that respect.
That's why I like it so much.
Overnight, cos I have a proper sleep it helps cure 
Mm.
the cold.
Ah dear !
Yeah, Dan's car broke down on the way to Birmingham you know.
Did it?
Yeah, the erm  the alternator or distributor it hadn't been wired properly, it had been rewired but not done properly.
What did he do?
Oh he rang the A A.
Oh he's a member of the A A isn't he?
I suppose his parents joined him or something,worry !
But he sat there three hours on the motorway  waiting for the bloody A A man to find him and, apparently he didn't find it, couldn't find him sa cos he rang back  he said, look  there's no one come yet !
And apparently the one that had gone out to him  hadn't found him, so they sent another one and he  found him straight away with his directions .
So  I dunno what happened to the first one.
Was he on the motorway?
I'm not sure where he was actually, I think he must have been.
Oh that's not very .
They couldn't find somebody, I mean there's no way you can turn off it's just
Yeah.
The police had to tow him to a lay-by or something, or to the side  cos erm  it just cut out   and that was it!
He had no chance to pull to the side of anything .
There was a  a Queen concert on telly last night.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So?
Mike's not that bothered anyway cos he  cos I told him, mind you, he's in Tenerife anyway, but his mum would have recorded it.
Has he gone for a fortnight or a week?
Got to unpack all my stuff again.
Mind you, like I said, with these boxes I'll put them underneath the bed and not un bother unpacking them too much.
Or swap the stuff.
What a difference.
My throat's raw.
Raw.
Is it?
Is the Chloraseptic still in there?
It should be.
Unless it ran out.
It was, near the bottom.
I dunno.
There's not as much as I thought there was then.
I don't know.
When I left I took all medicines down here  you know.
I got Optrex in my room but I bought that cos  I used it so much.
There's all, so that'll just stay there!
I bought quite a few  medicines actually .
Mainly because  I prefer to take medicine.
Some people won't take medicines.
You know George
Mm.
she's asthmatic and she won't take Ventolin.
And that's bloody stupid isn't it?
Well I can understand why, but the trouble is what yo what she doesn't realize  she's, her  if she has an asthma attack and she won't take  Ventolin, she's in trouble!
She's putting a strain on her heart  
Heart?
Yeah.
Yes.
Cos very often asthmatics die of  heart failure.
Do they?
Mm.
If you imagine the blood's  going round  and you're trying to get  you know 
Oh yeah!
and then you can't.
Yeah.
But it's not really got to .
Puts a strain on the heart.
Yep.
Da I mean I don't
And not only that the 
I don't like the idea of Ventolin  this is what I said to them at the hospital that I can't, cos I'm not on 
Yeah, I know but it's just when she's sort of having to sit down all the time.
If it's a bit wheezy.
Yeah.
Erm  it's best really to have some Ventolin
Than go into an asthma attack.
than have a full scale asthmatic attack.
Yeah.
Exactly.
People die of asthma!
Yeah I know they do!
That's why it's a silly  thing not to take it !
You know?
I don't know whether she's even got any.
But she probably hasn't got any if she doesn't take it.
But I realize that pa taking paracetamol and things like that too often can get you too used to them and then it's a waste of time taking them.
So I don't tend to take them unless I have to.
Cos I haven't taken paracetamol for ages.
But they're my  Coproxamols 
Yeah.
Paracetamol don't work for me.
No, they're, they're wearing off on me.
You know, they don't have much of an effect.
I have to  have something else, but I can't take aspirin you see.
I just have to have stronger paracetamol.
 Cocodamol 
Mm.
Oh!
That's a point, I wanted to take some stronger painkillers back with me, what have you got?
Just paracetamol, I haven't got anything else.
Right.
It's just that
If you'd said yesterday you could of got some
 Cocodamol while you were
Oh yeah!
Oh I'll go out and buy some.
While I'm at university.
I've gotta buy erm, my prescriptions as well now haven't I?
Cos I'm not under nineteen any more.
Which means I have to claim my money back.
Oh I don't know that you get it back.
Yeah, but I have to er pay for it, and then claim it back.
But I'll have to ask the doctor about that when I go for my prescriptions.
Yes it's three pounds isn't it?
Is it three pound forty now?
Yeah.
I went to the doctors to get  what was it?
Repeat prescription, oh yeah, my erm    and erm  I was snivelling a bit, and she says, are you alright?
I says, yeah fine.
Yeah she said, written my prescription for   and she said, you sure you don't want something else?
No!
It's only a cold!
I'm not used to doctors asking me if I want something else !
I think it's cos they're student doctors, you know, they like to  prescribe   as much as they can for the students !
Ask her for some  Apertate for me.
Yes mum!
I bet she'd probably give it me as well!
That's if I have the same doctor of course.
It's far away from the Vale either, it's about half way between the university and the
Mm.
Vale  the doctors is.
I told you our dentist went to Birmingham didn't I?
Mm.
Right.
I'm gonna go and have my shower.
Okay?
You'll have a job dear!
The shower broke down about six months ago.
Ah!
Well it's the same shower
without any water in.
All I have is one wash or whatever.
Kyle!
Come and drink your tea.
Yeah.
The diary that she sent off for, for me's arrived.
Did it hurt when you first got up?
Well she'd know that that's, is that the one
Mm.
or is it the one she's still waiting for?
Why hasn't it come?
Well you keep saying it is.
Oh I don't know about that, no.
Erm  I'll pick you up about four o'clock?
Cos I'm not coming home at lunchtime you see.
Er  yeah, give me a lift .
Yeah, I'm pretty sure they have.
Are we down on the batteries?
Got no way of  getting in touch with you.
No.
I'm cold!
Not really sleeping at all.
Is that what she had, what's on today, if anything at all?
Yeah 
Erm 
Bloody awkward int it now?
It is innit?
It's difficult.
Will Tony know what there is on?
Oh I dunno.
He don't very often.
Usually leaves it till half past three and then says oh!
Meant to dash here and do so and so, and so and so!
Typical !
Well Anita's in today int she?
Mind, she don't finish very early on a Monday does she?
Well sometimes she don't come on a Monday.
Erm  no leave it, I'll come on the bus.
That'll .
Don't like two of you coming home on the bus but, especially when it's cold and horrible!
Well it should dry out later according to the weather forecast.
Is it raining now?
Yeah, very, very fine mist.
It was like that when I took Dee yesterday.
Cos I took her, but I hired the Granada  and I drove her there.
Definitely on the motorway in that than the stupid Mini!
Oh yes!
And that Mini frightened me on the motorway.
Cos, she had  mind you, I was  it was a weekday and there was loads of lorries on
Yeah.
and they just pull out  and they don't see me.
No.
You know, you're at the side of them and one starts to come around, you know, when you're doing sort of seventy and I'm at maximum speed, he's got plenty of  you 
Yeah.
know, throttle left, but I haven't!
And I've just got, you know, in the Granada you just put your 
 
foot down and get past him and out the way.
In the 
Yeah.
Mini  there's nowhere I can go, I'm stuck!
Mm.
Just waiting for the draught to come over .
Do you really think I'm  
he absolutely hated it!
?
 
?
Yeah.
Kyle's got a funny neck!
Eh?
His neck's hurting him, every time he moves, his neck's hurting.
Stiff neck.
He's in a draught.
Just saying, I've always had a funny neck haven't I?
I wonder if he's inherited it?
Or the 
Sleeping awkward.
Yeah.
I bet you have  got a draught 
What does he 
on it.
Mum where's a bottle of vinegar?.
I bet you are  laying with your head on one side.
Well I was laying like this on top of my .
Three, two, two  zero down at Devon!
You got plenty of books ain't you?
Good Lord!
Have I?
Oh dear !
I got a Christmas card that's  not opened!
What this one?
That one.

Oh!
From Julie and David.
Nice Christmas card from  Julie and David just opened !
Clever dad!

Well basically, what happens we wait till we get there then  
You never know you see.

Don't worry.
I say, I'll  I've got to walk the end of the street, get a bus.
At twenty past or ten to.

That's what bothers me.
Last time the bus waited for me.

I've lost my dad.
Hello Dad!
My heated rear screen's not working, why do you think it is?
Pardon?
My heated rear screen's not working.
Switch it on there  it's just not working at all.
Why 
Well 
would it be.
it might a cable off somewhere.
A break in the actual element.
Ah.
It's because the catch is not on there's  er one on there  and that 
It's there on the back
Yeah.
on that side but it's got a little bit of black on it, do you reckon that's anything to do with it?
Most probably.
Look, just there.
What is it?
Can't see.
Don't expect it is.
In these glasses, that looks like a Phillips innit?
I dunno.
You haven't got a screwdriver in here then.
No.
Another one in the shop.
Oh don't worry about it now.
As long as know what it is I'll do it when I get home.
When you get a i , a Phillips type of screwdriver
Yeah.
and just try tightening that one.
Yeah.
You reckon it's loose.
Yes it is loose, that one.
Is that right.
You got a bad earth.
As long as I know where it is.
Do you see, you see how it's misted up again, well in the morning's it's absolutely murder!
Oh I'll try it again.
You know, I'm just gonna  you might the hole's rotten.
In which case I shall have to get Brett out to do it.
A right murky day today!
Mm.
Horrible int it?
Pea soup down at  blooming  Amberston it was!
No it took me fifteen minutes tonight to get from school to Kyle's  Kyle's school!
Oh aye, it could do.
Fifteen minutes!
All those road works on the
 Uppingham Road.
I went down one way up the other and
You'll beat him.
Do you know something, it's alright I'm looking at the rear screen, I think it's started working  since you've pressed it, look.
Is it?
Yeah.
You watch.
It's a bad earth then.
What did you do, just press that terminal there?
Well I, I wriggled the main terminal, three over that side  and also the other, er that side.
I could have been either side that was  playing you up.
So what can I do about that?
Just  do it with that screwdriver when I get home.
Yeah.
Just tighten it up.
If it will tighten.
But don't go mad.
It'll only be a self-tapping screw, you know.
Just little things that keep going wrong on this car,do you know what I mean ?
Well they're all the same.
Little irritating things.
Had a blinking headlight problem on the van.
I had it for weeks and nobody done anything about it.
I checked everything on that.
Couldn't find a bloody problem!
Went and bought a new bulb  put a new bloody bulb in, still the same.
Oh th , they've done the old lamp.
This lamp this morning was laying over here.
Oh.
And er  eventually
Ah no, it's not working.
Thought 
No?
it was.
No, it's not
Eventually, it was the fuse in the fuse box, the fuse was alright
Yeah.
it was a contact at the fuse on the tab.
Oh!
I just wriggled it,, and polished it  up come the lights!
I thought Jesus Christ!
I'd had the he , I'd had the headlights out 
Just for a little thing like that!
and everything else!
So all I'd gotta check was the fuses.
And, you know, all the fuses were alright.
Just about bloody .
Electrics on vehicles are always the same.
Look at that, a bit moisture in them as well there I think.
Nine times out of ten it's always a bad earth.
But the trouble is, finding the earth, which one  appertains to what, you know.
What time did they set off to Rotherham?
Er  it must have been half ten, eleven o'clock, if not later I suppose.
Where's Rotherham?
It's  north country.
North, he says.
Not far off the borders.
Oh!
So it's a long way up then?

Well they got down alright this morning.
I reckon it's gonna settle again tonight by the looks of it.
Now the bank shuts we'll go in  gotta go down to A J Hobsons, the other side of the dual carriageway.

All I, I do is the books.
That's bad enough.
That's bad enough!
Mm.
That's a weekend gone for  a ball of chalk !
Talking about that, did you see that programme, I heard it on the radio actually  two days ago  about the fiddles the banks have been working?
Mm.
They've ruined more small businesses and a a overcharge 
I know, but but there's new legislation coming out.
Twenty bloody grand one firm lost!
I know.
Another one was six grand.
Well Peter was 
And er 
erm  he was  taken to the wall by the banks weren't he?
It weren't erm
Mm.
Yeah.
If he'd, if  the trouble with this system apparently,thi this 
Why do you think we wanted to have an overdraft Wal?
Why do you think we don't get in
Yeah!
Yeah!
for the bank?
God!
There's this bloke his  well a chum of his actually  got his statement  and said this can't be blinking right!
Can't owe them that amount!
And he worked it out, he took about three or four weeks to work it out, and he'd been overcharged on the interest  like.
Trouble is, how can you work it out?
Well he was a 
We've been overcharged even on  haven't we?
Well he was a computer programmer  so he designed his programme  to to shorten the ac the system, like, you know  and these have got together and now they're in business.
And one of the banks even employed them  to borrow, you know, to get a copy of their programme  to check their own system.
But it didn't say how much it cost for their services, you know.
Ya.
But th they are, they're no , they're gonna make a bomb out of it!
Yeah, one firm six  six grand they done him out of 
Yeah.
and er, he was foreclosed for two.
Mm.
In other words, if they hadn't got him with the six he'd never have gone bloody broke!
Gone broke , yeah.
Yeah.
Mm.
Well Peter had a deal with the bank  right, that they were gonna get so much money up
Yeah.
gives him an overdraft facility of so much money  enable him to work when he moved, and they reneged on it!
Reneged on it?
Yeah.
And left him short  and then  when he  had those bad debts
Yeah.
they just said, you know, no more!
Yeah.
Although he insisted  right, that they did this, that, and the other  and he followed their instructions to the letter
Mm.
he found himself deep in the shit!
Mm.
That's why he's so bloody anti banks!
And if ever there's tuppence too much on the bloody account he's on the blower!
Mm.
Well according to, these blokes said, the only safe way of getting er  money on overdraft  is to go through a German bank.
It's cheaper  much more understanding
and easier to put money up front.
He always likes to do it their way.
Oh!
Our bank's gonna go  out of space!
The British ,Bri , British bank are gonna take a dive!
They will!
If you got any money in the bank, get it out!
There'll be a run on a British banks like no tomorrow!

Seems like erm a good idea actually.
Yeah.
Keeps them off the streets doesn't it?
Yeah!
I've been talking to some of them about it, it's meant to be, cos I didn't know it was going on, and I saw them in the paper, says oh!
I saw you in the paper!
Did you see me as well miss?
Oh!
Oh!
Cos sometimes, some take a good picture and you know straight away the kids 
Mm.
and others can, you know  sit and stare at it for an hour still wouldn't know who it was.
That  bird's really having a go int it ?
Oh he's comical 
He  
he is!
He has us in fits and the funny thing was we were sat listening to him the other night, all having us dinner, we're sat at table and it was ever so quiet listening to him and  he sort of erm  he mimics the other bird
Yeah.
he doesn't actually say, well he does say the odd word if you listen carefully, of his own
Mm.
but other than that he mimics everything this one does, but cos it's in a softer tone than when Cork does it, he  sounds quite funny.
It's nice actually.
They're company for each other aren't they?
Mm, yeah.
I think 
And they 
when  we're out, you know  when there's nobody here
Mm.
like when we're all sitting in the front room at night and then they sa I think they chirp away to each other quite happily, you know.
Ah ah!
He don't know what to play with next, his mirror or his swing.
I know.
Dashing from one to the other.
That mirror goes through it!
It's a nice 
But erm 
cage that is int it?
Yeah, it was er  a bargain that was!
It was erm 
 Addams on Uppingham Road.
Mm.
Well, the one in town closed down  you know, next to Lewis's?
Oh yeah.
And so they had  the stuff from there that wasn't  that hadn't sold and 
Mm.
took it down to that shop  and er, it was, I got it from there and it was ten pound!
Good God!
So, well say, I did, Lovell did.
I didn't even realize the one in town had gone   till the other day .
Didn't you?
I thought  Addams had gone 
Did you?
I know!
And I went round town on Saturday  and I'd gone more or less from work as well so  I'd got my big bag with me and  ooh my shoulder!
I mean, we're in town 
Oh!
for a couple of hours.
Shoulder were killing me!
So when I went, I had to go again on Monday  I took just my purse in my pocket and thought oh this is bit, cos I mean I knew what I was going for, you know, weren't looking round for anything in particular and I thought this is bit risky!
So I nipped in and bought one of them little tiny bag, I've never had tiny bag before.
And er, ooh I love it!
Every time I go out now I keep chucking this little bag  over my shoulder 
Oh!
it's great, you know !
So used to having a great big thing, I am.
Yeah.
I think the bigger bag you put, the more you su rubbish 
Rubbi Oh!
you put in it.
The bag I used to use for work when I was a hired help, oh my God!
Mm!
And you get a different one 
 
and you think next time I'll have one a bit bigger, you know, and then, next time one a bit bigger still 
Yeah.
That one weren't big enough, I couldn't get everything in it.
Yeah.
And so , you just keep getting
You end up 
Now I 
like a horse's nose bag over your shoulder 
Yeah!
don't 
Now I've erm  changed my job I just take my ordinary handbag.
Mm.
Mind you , I've gonna wear that out now, my leather bag aren't I?
Need another one.
Well I got that one.
That's the little one I bought.
Yeah!
That's nice.
And it was  four ninety nine from a shoe firm.
I thought, that's ideal just for 
That's leather int it?
Yeah!
It is leather.
See.
Ideal for just walking round town.
Oh!
That's great!
Four ninety nine?
Yeah!
Ooh!
I'll have to have a look in there.
But they were all funny prices, some had got eight ninety nine on, and some had got four ninety nine, and I, couldn't see the difference.
I couldn't figure out which were  and when the girl  er, you know, when, when I took it to the counter she  she said, ooh this is good value for  four ninety nine !
Int it leather?
Ooh!
You know, I said yeah!
I mean it's got a sticker on it, genuine leather.
I think they've either been priced wrong or somebody had
Mm.
I think somebody had sort of started pricing them and then somebody else had probably took over and they ended up with the wrong price on but  I didn't mind!
Well , you weren't gonna argue the toss!
No.
I got a dress in Marks's this week before last, seven ninety nine reduced from twenty nine ninety 
Oh!
nine.
Usually have a good sale though don't they?
They don't 
Yeah.
It was the only one.
Apparently it was some of the summer stock left.
You know, it's that floppy Viscose?
Mm mm.
You know?
Yeah.
And it's, burgundy with cream spots  button down front and then, sort of pleat starting from just below the waist.
Oh that sounds nice!
And fitted , you know?
Yeah.
Seven ninety nine!
Yeah.
I couldn't believe it!
My size!
I got some sko some skirts last year from there  my mum did, you know, she were quite pleased with them cos  usually they're quite  aren't they?
I love Marks's sale!
Yeah.
I am, it's not a shop I go in very often.
I'm  I'm not a  Marks's or Lewis's, anything like that, I er er
Oh I'm just Marks's.
I just like, I like the Marks's.
Yeah.
No I'm not, I'm not very  but, when I do go in  I have a sort of look round and the prices usually 
Mm.
astonish me!
And erm
I find I get more value for my money though, cos it lasts me longer.
The stuff I buy from Marks's is always good quality.
Yeah.
I don't like buying kid's 
They last longer.
clothes from there.
Because I think tha i I don't like anything that lasts long on kids.
If yo if you understand what I mean.
I'd rather 
Yeah.
them wear it out  I'd rather it 
Yeah.
wear out and me throw it away than it still be good and  don't know what to do with it, you know, you're thinking 
Yeah  
oh this is still too good to put in the rag bag basically, you know, that sort of.
I'd rather have it
Oh I've got loads of people I pass stuff on to.
Yeah.
Well I 
I mean 
do if I've got anything, but I find half the time, I mean, it's like jeans and things, if you go into Marks's you can spend fifteen pound on a 
Oh!
I never buy I never buy for him in Marks's.
No.
Kids' jeans fifteen pound!
And they 
I tell you what I do for jeans, I get them from car boot sales now!
Yeah.
Well I've been, I've just bought, I bought some on Monday for Laura  and I got them from Rascals.
Now they were only  one pair were  er, eleven ninety nine, and one pair, well I mean she is ten now  one pair were eleven ninety nine, and one pair were  thirteen ninety nine I think, but then we've got ten percent off  so that weren't too bad.
And then  one pair were, didn't fit right when she got them home, so, I've took them back  and, got another pair.
And I've also saw some in there for Danny as well, and they were only seven ninety nine.
Well I pay that anywhere for Danny's.
The black jeans.
Yeah.
So I thought that were quite good really.
Mm!
Being a shop like that, cos that's usually, well  can be dear in there.
But normally I get them off the market.
Where is Rascals?
It's in the arcade.
You know in one of the arcades?
Oh I know!
They do all the page boy outfits and things in there?
Is that it?
Erm  I don't know, they could do.
I've never really looked at that side of it, you know, so I don't really know.
But they most probably do.
I think that's where his page boy outfit come from.
Corner of  Street in the arcade?
Is it that one?
No it's not on the corner, it's further in.
Oh I know!
You know the Swiss Cottage, opposite there.
Yeah.
That's where it is.
I know!
Yeah.
But, as I say, again, it's not a shop I often go in.
I mean I  they've got a, a stall on the market, I've seen something on the market  on that stall, but they've not got it in  their size and they'll say to you, ooh, go over to the shop, you know, and you go over 
Mm.
to the shop and then you find more things you like when you're in there.
Mm.
But it's not, normally, a shop I just go to.
It's usually from the market stall, when I get sent over there.
Cos I like the market, I really do.
The only thing I dislike it for, you can never find the same stall if you've got to take anything back.
Back, yeah.
That's it, it's when you come to take stuff back int it, the market?
I got a, good buy for him on  that coat he's wearing, got it in Benny's.
Mm.
I'd never been in there before but
Oh it's cheap!
but it's good!
Yeah!
Yeah!
And er, it's Cam Campri.
Yeah.
And it 
Oh I thought you said Campari 
was thirty six quid 
what you 
Yeah!
said.
and er, it was thirty six pound, but she knocked another three pound off cos there was a little mark on the front which just  sponged off as soon as I got home.
Mm mm!
That's the way to do it!
We were thrilled with it, you know.
Well, considering there's not supposed to be any V A T on kid's things, I mean
Phworgh!
God!
only the price of the adult ones aren't they?
Yeah.
I mean, it's like the jeans, I say, for Laura I paid fourteen ninety nine for a pair there, and eleven ninety nine for the other pair, well I've been  and got myself two pair  cos I mean, it's more or less all I wear  just a, a couple of weeks before, and I'd only paid twelve ninety nine a pair for my own!
Mm!
So I mean, I had actually paid more for  hers er, than, you know.
Well I think they're so, my own I don't mind paying a bit more for really, because they're so  last me such a long while.
Yeah.
I wear them day in, day out, you know.
I mean, I  I've got like five pair at the moment.
Some what I call are comfy ones, some that I can't breathe in, you know!
My going out ones .
Oh I can't wear jeans now.
When I've lost weight.
There's a Weightwatchers opened in the school.
Oh!
Oh I know , I went the first night.
Did you?
Yeah.
Any good?
Well  I only,th I mean  the woman made me feel dead small because I said to her  you know, she was asking everybody why they'd come and I said, well I've only come to give Chris moral support, which was the truth because  until about three hours before  we went, I didn't even know it was there
Mm.
and she rang up and said that she wanted to go and would I go with her?
And I said yes, you see.
Of course, the woman said why do you come?
So I says, well I've come for Chris really.
So she said, oh they all say that!
And she made me feel about two inches high 
Yeah.
you know!
Are you going again?
Well I didn't go, no, cos Chris int going, so I didn't bother going but  I must admit, I mean, when she gave me the papers and what have you that goes with it, I come home, I put it in the cupboard and I've not even looked at it since.
Mm.
Three pound eighty 
 
int it?
Yeah.
But the re th the actual thing's free.
Mm.
The erm
Registration.
Yeah.
It's supposed to be eight pound or something 
Mm.
normally.
I'm trying to diet on my own.
Well I've been doing it for a 
In fact 
fortnight.
I mean  it's okay like if you're getting weighed with other people, and yes, it's quite nice and you've got the encouragement and everything, but when all's said and done, dieting  dieting is all down to willpower.
It don't matter how much 
I know.
at any class, you can't buy that.
No.
It's all down to yourself.
I'm not into dieting, I'm into food.
Oh I'm into food all the time!
Trouble is, I got three dinner  parties coming up, you know, well  out 
Yeah.
for dinner and dinner parties   so I'm sort of frantically trying to cut down , and then, you know, one dinner party and then I put it 
And then eat, yeah, that's it.
straight back on again!
Yeah.
What do you do, cut out your social life, you know?
Well  that's what the argument's always been int it?
You know, I mean  even at these diet clubs, oh well, you know don't stop going out just eat what you, but if you go out and you're eating  sweets for  you know, after your dinner 
Mm.
you have a sweet and all that sort of thing, I mean you can't  I can't resist them if I go out for a meal, I've got to have the sweet, I'd rather have the sweet 
Mm.
than the main!
Yeah.
I mean th the starters I'm never too fussy about.
I can take or leave that but  I do like the main course, I do like 
Depends on the starter, if it's a nice, a special starter then, ooh!
I want it!
You know, but 
No , I'm never  no they don't bother me.
They often put me off my meal.
But erm  sweets, I could eat  well  mine and somebody  else's !
If I put my mind to it, you know!
If they're, if they're nice ones, yeah.
 
Yeah.
If they're nice ones.
Yeah, just the nice ones.
I mean, cheesecake!
Ah!
Ooh yeah!
Especially 
 
when it's a homemade one.
Mm.
I mean, crumble, I like crumble.
I've just stopped baking cos I'm dieting, I have 
Yeah.
stopped baking!
Well I must admit, I have, I mean I don't do  well  I used to make quite nice cakes, since I've had this new cooker mine won't ri I mean they rise, there's no doubt about that, they rise, but I can take them out, put them on a cooling rack and watch them deflate!
Deflate.
Oh!
You know !
They just
Sickening!
go down and  well that irritates me, so I've so I've give up that.
The only thing I can make is my normal, what I call a family fruit cake, which is very simple and quick i well not quick really but, I usually have it on when the Sunday roast's doing so  but erm  and that's about it, you know.
They rai they do fine but
I can't resist it, once I've made it I can't resist it.
I love it when it's warm!
Ah!
Oh yeah!
 
Ooh!
I tell you, I just, I just started to .
There we go.
Have you noticed I've done it with Loving Care?
Not
Your colour?
I, I 
Yeah.
thought, yeah, I thought it looked a nice colour, it does look, you know, it does look nice and shiny and 
It's been done, it's been done about two weeks
and it's 
now.
er
And it gave it some condition, you know, when I 
Yeah.
did it with that.
So er
 
It looks much better a bit shorter, it's got much more shape to it.
It looks 
Yeah.
nice, yeah.
It'd just grown out that, I knew 
Yeah.
you know, the last 
Yeah.
week or so, it just got that bit 
I mean, the side bits look nice heavier cos it's  it gives you that  it goes up that way.
Yeah.
Instead of just coming down 
It does.
in a V shape 
Yeah.
it goes up that way.
I need it to go up that way 
That's right.
it just suits 
Yeah.
me better.
Thanks ever so much Julie for cutting it.
Alright.

No, I'll er  prefer to go this way.
 

Ooh yeah!
Well
I prefer it .
Oh!
Aren't you good?
No just that he was  you know, just a bit concerned that's the logo thing and I thought well what does it look like?
I know it's a black raven on  the thing and the  written over the top of it.
The only thing is i it would have been nicer if it had of printed.
I mean that sort of yo er yo er, although, really you want them to see that cos they know what it's about then, then they'll read that, but, it would have been nice if that had of been  darker
Yeah.
like this, but that, I'd done, you know, you could do on the typewriter and that so
No.
That's brilliant!
Well I thought that was quite good.
Well it's eye-catching isn't 
Mm!

It's what you want.
Just coloured in quick.
I mean, it'll be a photocopied finally 
Oh I had to learn how to use that photocopier, ooh and a  and, oh my giddy aunt!

Yeah.
Could be two ends broken and 
and then it, yeah.
