We are making two changes in our meter-reading procedures.
Both will keep down our costs â€” costs that are reflected in the price you pay for electricity.
We are improving the network of routes our meter readers follow, so that we use the most efficient and economic pattern of working.
For most customers any changes to the meter-reading route will have little effect.
Some customers, however, will receive one bill covering a different period, either longer or shorter than normal.
In these cases the standing charge will be adjusted to meet the different period.
(After the initial period future bills will be for the normal 13-weeks.)
We propose to make our quarterly call to read your meter five times in every six quarters.
You will continue to have a bill every quarter.
The other bill will be a "planned estimate" and we shall not come to take a reading that quarter.
In most cases our customers find our estimates reasonably accurate.
In any event, they are adjusted one way or the other at the next meter reading.
However, if on checking the estimate with the reading on your meter you find your consumption is very different from the estimate we shall willingly amend the bill to your own reading.
The "planned estimate" will be sent in all cases, even if you have a meter box outside your property or we have made other arrangements with you for access.
THESE CHANGES WILL HELP TO KEEP DOWN OUR COSTS
