If you're not doing it like that and you're in a conversation or atmosphere in the room, when I find it, this little gadget is wonderful, this will pick up for a long way, this will pick up the dogs next door, if there was no other noise in this room.
Mm
This is a little mike stand okay and it
Mhm
sit like that and to attach it all you do is swing it round vertically, plonk it on, I've done that wrong
 

oh, well it goes like that
That's right
and it consists I mean you've got probably what a yard maybe
Mhm
I would think possibly up there, if you two are sitting here
Mm
then it would make sense if you're gonna continue doing that
Yeah
Yeah
to have it somewhere like that
yeah I mean to be honest it's just a case of one of you, it does go that way, I knew I was right the first time, of one of you just remembering
Yeah
to turn the tapes over
Yeah, it'll probably be me
and, and also then 
I'm sure it will 
and al , also then the batteries, every third tape 
Yeah 
because they do use a lot of juice up
Mm
okay
Mm
so that's that, that's all of that, thank you very much
No, no problem
and I'll see you next week
Aha
at erm four-ish about four 
Yeah, well if that's alright, only as being that's the, what I call the end of month, like I've got to pay all of the bills and they must get it until the next, the end of the month
Yeah, well fair enough
the whole lot
fair enough, you don't need your headphones
Mm, no
so I'll take those back with me, I've got another pair in here
Mhm
erm, oh I'm, and that's it, that's great 
alright 
so, don't worry about bad language, I mean any sort of dialect you know, just forget it's there
Yeah
Mm
One thing I think it does tell you in your guidelines, one is, if you do have friends round, out of courtesy you should maybe say so this is an experiment 
Say you've got a 
cos they go ooh for about three seconds or a couple of minutes and they'll forget about it
Yeah, well I don't think we plan any at the moment do we?

Oh er the bloody thing's finished now 
What your jumper?
Yeah

Yeah, it's a girl now we know what it is don't we?
Er
perhaps a couple of little roses or something like that 
Yeah or go down and buy a couple of those little roses, which is much simpler
Well yeah

You know much nicer we really want it very, very pretty 
but there again , but there again if they start cos kids do pull 
running , not very big er mat matinee jacket though is it really?
No
You know 
cos she's fed up with you that's why  I've lost this film now.
I think it's rubbish anyway
Yeah, yeah  I probably think that they're having an affair I think
I think so 
she looks old and haggard in this
Mm, it's amazing what they can do though with make-up and
Well they can make her into an old, old lady
just trust Fletcher, she's quite smart and nice ain't she?
Yeah

Who's the maid
Dunno

I wonder if we're suppose to talk all the time?
Dunno, well you can't talk all the time you'd have a sore throat wouldn't you?
I mean it's, it's general I suppose I mean if it would be better to switch it on and off which you can do and er, you know, I mean we can't sit here continually talking
Well I know, I know
I'd never get my letters written anyway  so if you want to switch it off, I'll get on with my letters and erm you do your knitting and I'll, what is the time?
I've got to do the potatoes yet
So that's every fo , every second we think to say something, we've got to turn it on?

I know I saw it
Yeah I that
it don't mean a thing really, but
It don't mean anything at all, but then nevertheless, I mean they always want somebody to do these sort of things it's all, all for a purpose I suppose
Oh well
I don't er ta very much 
it's all a survey's a survey innit?
Surveys yeah, but I mean from your and my point of view we don't sit here talking all the time, but when your father gets in then there's talk

but these were are all  crumped and I don't want clumsy ones  cos you feel as though you've got Doctor Marten's or something on you know
But they're not comfortable after a while 
and they look it though, they look it, that you know, they really do
All fuddy duddy
Yeah, yeah and they're sort of grey, I'm not sure if she got them in a charity, I'm certainly sure it wasn't bought in a shoe shop, cos she goes round every charity, she won't go in, you know I told you about that, oh I don't know what it is, she said it's loaded out with stuff and we'll have to have a walk round there, erm, round by what was Kennedy's, erm
Yeah
by the bingo hall
Yeah
that was a fruit shop she said it's loaded out as a cheap shop she said and erm, she won't go in there because bloke's stood in there, she said she don't mind going in and paying fifty, because, well they don't do that do they?
No
you know, so erm
Yeah, but he's only watching the
well he's probably got nowhere else to go, I mean it's 
No 
just aged off innit, there must be an out place, but you wouldn't er
I wouldn't leave them
No you wouldn't leave it, but she said it's a cheap shop so, but she said there's loads
but I've got to go to job spot one time 
Yeah 
so when we walk round
Yeah, yeah that's right, but I mean just go and have a look, and I actually said to her well you'd be better with somebody else, you know, not going in there on your own
Yeah
and erm, you know, she, she obviously needs somebody else with her to make it not so obvious for her
Yeah
not
but I think that, that with what it is you know, but then I say she's got that anyway, she's not as, as tough as what she makes out, but er it would be worth having a look you never know what's in there, and I say I must pick up a couple of paper towels
Yeah
I'm not, I'm not gonna pay any more than that
There's no point in it.
No, oh I know what I never got that ain't finished I'll have to go down the shops, I might go down
What?
I didn't get that baby card did I?
You don't know whether
I looked
No
I di last night when I was up there and he said to me what was that noise, I went through all the piles and I had a quick look in the bureau but, I didn't find that, I don't know what I've done with that
I know there was a baby one, you know that, erm  pile with all different cards
And there was a baby one in there?
I'm sure there was, I'll go and have a look
There was get wells and driving test, oh have a look because I mean 
I'm sure there's one there
it was, it was particularly, it, it totally for a girl
Yeah
because I said it was erm Simon's, and then I didn't know really where they lived and erm, I know they moved out, out of next door to Lesley's, and in the end it never got done that, that more to the point  but erm I can't do that up until I've done that can I?
Well I can't do that up until the coat's ready anyway
Oh yeah
but erm that 
what shall we do with that then?
Oh I don't know I mean it's gonna go through there, well I suppose I'm sure I can get some round the neck
It won't fit round the neck
Got to fix it then haven't you?
You'll want somewhere where you can either have it hanging 
Well no what did I do with that one for  erm Ian and Diane?
might get it through the bottom, that'll be simpler won't it?
I don't know what's gonna be simplest?
When I did that one for Ian, we just tied it in at the back didn't we?
Mm
And had that
well let it dry off for a minute, well they must have a card, good job I thought about that  I should be interested to see what she calls her because I think Annalise is a beautiful name
Yeah
and you don't hear it much here do you?
No, well, it's like Nina's name, I can't remember it, Anastasia or something like that
Yeah, and shorten it to Nina
Yeah, how they got Nina out of it, it is something like Anastasia, but it's
Well Nina must be in there somewhere so
Well I believe er, her sisters used to call her Neen
Anasteen, Anasleen, Anasleen 
some something like that and they used to call her Neen
Oh
and she said I don't like that call me Nina
Yeah
and it stuck at 
Oh well they've added the A on then 
Yeah 
obviously
Mm, nobody calls her, whatever it is
No
well they all call Annalise that
Annalise
Annalise, I've never heard anybody out there call her Anna or Lisa, or Lise or anything, always Annalise, it's such a pretty name
Yeah
ain't it?
It's funny you know, if you give them a long name
Yeah they don't shorten it
they get very shortened
but their, the name of their new house is Dew Drops
Is it?
It's very nice
Yeah
innit?
Well it's the oldy-worldy
Yeah, certainly is, I think that's super
but I don't know why Hayley and Ian are called theirs Jack?
So did Susan, Susan called theirs Jack, that little boy
Oh yes, but er
Well Jack were then, they, they put these, in the paper periodically they put 
Well the girl was gonna be Layla
What erm
if they had a girl it was Layla
What Hayley?
Yeah
Mm quite nice that, I don't mind that
Fleetwood Mac song
Oh is it?
Mm
Oh I didn't know that, but erm, no in the paper periodically 
 
went mad on it, on Fleetwood Mac
Oh, but when Prince Andrew was born that caught on
Yeah
you know X years ago, but this is what they do
and Eugene
er, well
I haven't heard any Eugenes
No, that was picked out the history book
would of picked that, they had a
book here didn't they?
I should of gone through the book to find that, put some money on it  because if she had Victoria as well, I thought about Victoria and er of course I didn't know about Eugene I don't read, but it's in the book
Is it?
Yeah
I 
oh yeah 
If there are any
Don't know what it'll be do you?
no, I don't think they'll have any more now
No I don't think they will but you can't really believe all that you read in a newspaper can you?
No, but they don't seem a happy couple at the moment do they?
Well it's the impression you get innit?
Yeah, but there again the
wouldn't give out or let that out
No
if there weren't a certain amount of truth
Oh it's got all
something totally out
oh yeah
Though he's got all those people up there again, Amy  Karen er not Karen er Caroline
Caroline
and er Peter 
Oh you know that erm  course that  erm cookery
Yeah
for German
Yeah
well there's a holiday one, it's  a holiday 
 
one at, at
yeah, well what is that then?
Ten weeks but that would probably only be sort of erm
A German holiday?
Yeah
Oh what like erm a
yeah
That's quite interesting then and you don't know when that one starts?
Well it's starting earlier than that, but I wonder whether to leave it until  because I might already know most of
Yeah, oh you do know certain, a certain amount don't you?
Just got to get to get the sentences, oh I know quite a few words 
Yeah I mean we can get by over there can't you?
Yeah, I think I'll wait until September and
Well you won't wait until that long you'll put it down in May 
May 
won't it?
Yeah
So don't forget that, I think that's more comprehensive and that was a Monday night wasn't it?
Yeah
So even with swimming
Oh I won't pack up at my swimming
No, oh no
No, what I think I'll do swimming-wise is go down to seven fifteen
Yeah, do you wanna go Monday dinner time, if you're not, you're not
wouldn't phone you on Monday, she may, but she isn't supposed to
She isn't supposed to, well if you're, you're working though aren't you?
I'm working but it's half past twelve innit?
That's right, yeah, I don't mind
Well let's, let's, let's say we'll try
Yeah
and see what the weather's like and you name it, I mean we know now
Well let me just check me diary, I know
no, but we now know that, if it, if I've got the right time, half past twelve's fine
Yeah
erm, oh wait a minute I can't 
You can't the cooker man
the cooker man, oh well let's see another day then dependent on this
Mm
I mean cos if that job's available Bev
I'll take it
you'll have to have a start about it won't you?
Yeah
I mean it'll stop you
Oh it'll stop me
what's name, but that don't matter because although
he said to me part time er, but of course he didn't know, erm they might, might want somebody part time, but erm, I mean that's gotta be at least even if it's three pounds an hour
Oh I'm not thinking about it
Well you're not bothered about that anyway
I'm not even bothered to think about it 
I mean eight hours a day, it's gotta be over the hundred 
Er nine thirty to five thirty so I won't get in till 
What?
I won't get in till I don't know when
What?
get on the bus and that
In the morning?
No
No he's picking you up at night
Oh he'd pick me up at night, I see
he said half past five is fine, half past five 
past five 
is fine
Yeah
no it doesn't, that's no problem
well really it's not that much further forward 
it's only down the road innit?
I say no, that, that ain't the problem
Hopefully if I do get it, there's somebody there, that's going from Andover
Well that's what I said, you don't know do you?
No
Or somebody in the next place or the next place, we reckon we know where it is
Do you?
no Woolworth's
Woolworth's
Have you never been out there?
No
No, well it's the big paved erm way 
Long way?
Oh yeah, there's, mind you
but what's out there is load of erm unit factories, unit places and 
Well it'd have to be somewhere
Yeah similar to my place up there
Yeah
er but a bigger area and they're like big warehouses, big, well like the
yeah
and erm, he's got in the, in the fabric one he's got double doors and all the rolls of carpet and erm, he's got a table in there and obviously to make a cup of tea, got a couple of beds in there cos he's sold them and it's like a big warehouse and erm  all around there there's a big concreted area, you know, and er all these units and that's where we, we reckon it is.
I mean there's a lot there, there's a lot of
Places
places  yeah  no, no the evening one would be a doddle  Anyway we'll wait and see, might not occur.
I mean if then, if you did then the, the
are out
Yeah
but then, providing we go on the Tuesdays you can still go German on the Mondays, anyway couldn't you?
Yeah
well for all that time 
if you have that 
I won't
probably won't be there
they won't be there
No that's right, no
but thirteen weeks
Yeah, well that's norm isn't it?
I don't know
Yeah, well when I, when I was up RAF Andover
I had a feeling that it's six weeks
Oh I, how awful for thirteen weeks, with me, I know she did when she had Ian went back
I know she did, but anyway doesn't matter whatever it is.
Well then I'd have to stop the Income Support 
Oh yeah , oh yeah you most probably end up with
so you couldn't do that, you'd have to tell them that, and say well I've got to start my
because I'm involved with the
I'll have a temporary job
Ah?
I'll have a temporary job
Yeah, oh no you'll have to
things like that 
we get on quite well
you know
Yeah, we seem to get held up everywhere we go
Yeah we did
I couldn't believe it when
no, never mind  ha, my brother went into the
if I buy them too big then they're, all
on the floor
Yeah
you know, they're just too long
Oh I'll try a pair of yours on
Yeah, but they're stretchies that's what's so nice about them
Yeah
and the material is, you feel the stretch, the others are like this and they just sit there, but then in the end they ride up you see
They bag
Oh they bag something terrible but then I say at the price I'm not gonna buy them, I'm not, but in the Dodger's there's not one small in any colour 
No 
well then if I go onto a medium, then you're getting all this length and all this business here, all that business and it's too much, if I could of found a four I'd certainly tried it on for swimming you know,but I don't want it all baggy and horrible  you know
and I do like that sewing stripe down the middle
Yes
because it always looks smarter than, like this  just plain
Like a pin stripe sort of thing
Well it's just like
isn't it?
a crease
Mm
when you iron in a crease it's, it's just like that ain't it?
I
I don't know
A bit dodgy
yeah
 

You put that corned beef in the fridge didn't you?
Yeah
Do you want some salad cream for now?
I think there's enough
Oh cos I'm going down the shop
I wouldn't bother
No, I'll do it tomorrow then  do something different for dinner tomorrow, well you can either try some, oh I've got another here, we could try
eh?
Sandra does it, but I mean I wouldn't bother with
all that
Oh no 
They certainly do bring the old repeats back don't they?
Mm
I mean they're not bad little programmes, but quite seriously you
We've seen them
though
once you've seen them  If I put one of those skirts on, the navy I think, and if I get any marks on it
well no, I'm only wearing me bloody coat and the skirt and er grey tights that's all, er whatever up top  I mean I hope that, have a look, I hope it's gonna be a better bus anyway this week 
Make sure that hip's on the side then
I've already got one, I'm not bothered about that, I mean for kids I think, I think it's a good idea because well then they don't lay on it
Oh I've done that for many a year
Yeah, oh it is neater I agree with that, I just want to get on with it now
You're not happy with it are you?
I am happy with it, I've just lost interest
Oh
No I, I want it certainly  oh you must get hungry in a minute surely  we must try that freeze dry too
Yeah freeze dry too
How many cups was in there?
Six
Mm, it's incredible really
Mm 
It'll be nice if you could summon up people like that on the phone won't it?
Oh yeah 
oh dear  god I've got to work at Albridge tonight
Go to sleep on the bus
Well yeah but it takes longer on the bus, but er
But if you're tired you can go to sleep anywhere
Oh you do  I hope Tommy's got that photo of her now
when did he post it?
Or did I post it?
He posted it didn't he?
He post it
That'll be last Saturday then won't it, that's a week then won't it?
I'm sure she's on the move, for it, you know
Yeah
I mean it came out well I thought, it came out very well, considering it was, you know, different process, and it certainly does the job and I still haven't got my damn postcards have I?
No
yeah I would, I've got to write to Dot tomorrow
Yeah, yeah
cos I think it's only fair
I've got that card, I think it's in there 
oh no, well I mean, I think you've got to do it properly, I don't think you should do it on the caravan because A you're gonna get the reception, B you're gonna have to make an appointment and it, in a letter
I'll probably have to see them anyway
Sorry?
I'll probably have to go up to them 
Well you probably shall well that's, well that's their choice then not yours
Yeah
but the whole point is you can put down every detail in a letter for them to read, to put on file, can't you?
No I think you should do it, do it that way round 
Well I'll pop up there first then
Yeah
even if I'm not
I'll give them a ring tomorrow
Yeah
and erm  I mean really it's a bit difficult actually because er you don't know about that
 

Why?
Well you don't know whether you'll be able, you can go down in an evening
No I'll just say I'll pop down some time
She might of had hers by now mightn't she?
Yeah, whoops big
oh big foot 
Well she might be that little bit further on let's face it I mean
Yeah, I could 
Well otherwise you might be you know, a little bit further, but
I wonder whether how long it's gonna take Martin to fit that gear if Martin can do it 
Well I want, now I want yeah well I understand but I wonder how long since they will leave it  she's already looked for an answ , you know she doesn't get an answer, that's the point, I should think by now he'd
I can't see, I mean, of course I mean she can take him to court over the money
Mm
if he disagrees or don't do anything, but I can't see how he can't leave it, can be without it, has to know 
Oh I'd
yeah, but not from her point of view I mean, not from her point of view she'll, she'll surely just go ahead 
they are a damn nuisance
well we ain't had lots and lots
Well since Helen went we've had no luck at all with neighbours, I think they're
disgusting  but then they're not the sort of people you can talk to are they?
No  is there a girl up this road called Rachel?
Not that I know of, well I mean I don't know
Two er, two kiddies, er there's that, that one then, it's gotta be
What one?
Sandra
Why?
They're not called Rachel 
No, but, who else up here's got two children?
Well there's a woman that comes up
not the woman with three there's another woman that's got two, I don't know her, she comes round with some of those envelopes sometimes
Er because

it's a bit of er
Yeah
erm  she, she said I know somebody up your road
Yeah

I don't know who's up the top, who lives up there I mean
No

Yeah

I don't know anybody
Sharon and her man went, on er

The Rosea, the big, big hotel, come 
Opposite the bell
Opposite the bell
Oh yeah
There's a
the bell is yeah, but certainly the other one's changed it's name anyway, it's not the Rosea not now, but er, it's gone
Oh
it's in the paper cos, a fellow on the way to work said it was and she, Graham got married in the May and er they get married in Cyprus but
They were gonna hold something here
they were having one here as well and erm they booked it for the day and they were staying there overnight, cos they were, they've got a house and they were gonna let guests stay at their house and while they stayed up there and then
Oh dear
well I said to her I prefer the
cos when I got the paper I had a look and I
and she er she said what  and she said oh well I don't think I'll phone Graham but if Maxine shows him the paper, she said I reckon he'll phone them because er, it did say, I think in the paper that the, that she said they're letting everybody know
But somebody might take it home with them
so er
Yeah
Well er the banks call it in or something
Yeah but that's
is that done?
It can't be used for anything else I wouldn't of thought 
No, well no you wouldn't
Convention hall
But er, this hotel and, and banquet hall and
innit?
And, and they've got erm, well they must be more than the Portacabins, but I mean they've got erm places there though

two millions
Eh?
two million winners, three ain't there recently?
Yes, oh that's the er, you can't win any more on
No, that's what I mean there have been three big ones very recently, cos like syndicate won it and the old lady won it and that other woman, that younger woman won it  right what I've done, all bits together  what time do you think we'll be back?

Mm, mm
Hankies

Well I didn't know anything, nothing at all 
Well that's sort of there we are then
Thank you 
I think he'd been better for a long time on and off
Yes
he is now
oh was he?
As long as I can remember we've been up here 
 
I think don't you?
Yeah
what?
I should of wet my hair down
I shouldn't worry about it in this wind, anyway it's not the right time to do it in the wind, as cold as this, is it really?
I mean we're gonna get blown apart I think  we shall see won't we?
Mm, can you see with me sitting in the middle?
Yeah, no, no I don't
   

What car's that one then do you know?
No
Mm
it depends where David, erm
today don't it?
Oh
Could of been
could of been that, yeah
there's times when they got back look isn't it?
Mm, oh yeah 
Of course it will be now won't it?
What?
Bloody kid
Is there, oh yeah, always the way innit?
always the way I mean it's like when your trying to 
 
cross the road here, especially in the morning 
Yeah me, it made me late on Friday
Did it?
Yeah
Yeah
I know
I had to scoot round Church Lane
Yeah
the thing is when 
and I left twenty to
yeah, the thing is when I go to work it erm
What just down here?
About there?
Down here and trying to get past to get into Crick Laid
Mm
because you never know whether they're going to turn
No
You don't, that's quite right, I said no rea , not everybody uses their indicat indicator 
They don't use their indicators any more 
No they don't
er, if they're, er far, not too far away from the other car
Mm
they'll come round on his indicator
Mm, that's right, no I'm afraid it's er a bit of a pain, but as I say seven o'clock in the morning mind going
Yeah
off to
Road, sometimes I don't see a soul, Jimmy's about the only one I see
Mm
and another morning there's a stream of cars  I think it's being one minute ear early or one minute late
Mm
Mm, yeah but I was coming out at half past nine
Mm
yeah, well quarter to, twenty to ten
Mm
Yeah I was gonna say you'd think that early
yeah, been sorted wouldn't you?
lorries
There were lorries, cars, the lot
Mm
taxis and  one thing I know is they scoot round Church Lane
Mm, mm I know
and it was busy, but that's beside the point
Yeah, well it was beside the point because you, you had an appointment didn't you?
Yeah
Anyway if you're late it looks bad on you anyway straight away don't it?
These are like buying bad old crisps, the other one's there
Really?
Yeah
Generally find that don't you?
Very, very friendly, but he had his shirt tail hanging out the lot
Oh god
Who?
At this place she went
Yeah

Go and see the boss or is it over there,whi , which, where?
Gotta be over there

Oh good, oh Jill's in there already
Big one?
Big bus

Alright?
Hello how are you?
I'm fine thank you, hi you, alright?
Yeah
No I'm not sitting here, I'm just blocking the gangway


 

here, this will do 
 

is it
did you want it out?
Yeah
that's your arm innit that one?
Yeah
Have you got er, must have a knob somewhere
Is it under the seat or somewhere like that
No you're not in a car
I don't know I'll get Mick to have a look in a minute  ah, ah, is there a little handle at the side, at your side?
this one?
No
There's a, there's a
a lever
a lever here
so
have I, have I got one then?
That looks
Have you got?
I have got a lever here
Have you?
Yeah, down right down
Yeah


I think is done


Oh dear
How many were there then Mick do you know?
Well, forty eight originally
another five
Five
Five
so you should have forty eight?
Forty eight I think yeah
Who's missing then?
That's it then is it?
Where's that one?
up there
The Sheridan, I suppose it is innit?
Sheridan or Sheriton's, I don't know whether that's it or Sheriton's or Sheridon's, Sheridan, I don't know
ah?
well no
well no it doesn't, get it right  see that's the station
Mm
where they were, Howard and Pete right were coming up to the erm football
I think right
and they shutted off
if we ever thought to ourselves what we're doing
mm
you might there, it drops you right
 
Oh you certainly are, yeah
ain't you?
but that, as I say for England and France erm they closed it for some reason
Who?
all the system was closed there, as Howard said erm it er a bit of a nuisance they had to go all the way round the houses
Yeah
I don't know how they did it in the end, but
Mm 
well it certainly was spectacular though 
Very good 
weren't it?
Very good
Ah?
Certainly was, as I say I don't think you'll see a lot of, better lot of colour than that
No
not anywhere
Oh that illuminist
yeah, yeah, it's surprising what you can do ain't it?
Yeah it was terrific
Oh tired now 
Tired now, yeah 
Yeah , still it means you haven't got to get on a train or
No
nothing like that, well that's the beauty of this innit?
Mm
Quite honestly  oh it was eight till ten that show was on for basically
Yes
yeah  yeah  what did you say they did it three times?
I don't know who was cooking actually they both had their hands 
Oh no quite probably matinee and then the early evening which I thought those people were coming out from look and erm, and this one, good grief fancy doing that be here half a day, you'd think you'd earn the damn money wouldn't you?
I don't know
I don't think so
No
yeah probably
so if that run is just tomorrow then we just got in didn't we?
Yeah
You know   
Tired
Ah?
Tired now
Yeah
what are they?
Chippendales
Yes, on Thursday that is
I know, it'll be worth suffering
Woolworth's wasn't it?
it'll be worth suffering Chippendales
Chippendales on Thursday


I don't know the programmes are pretty good aren't they?
Yes
and they don't do they?
I know they don't
Hope they're not like that bloke at Audrey's 
I can't wait until we get home, sometimes it goes quite quickly the journey though going home
Yeah, going home it does
Yeah, trying to get up there I mean you're waiting to see the show aren't you?
Yeah
So er, it's quite different ain't it  still it's not a bad time to come out
No
is it?
And I mean being that he parked there it was perfect weren't it?
Didn't have a long walk or anything    so the next schedule go out is erm is
is it?
I don't know, is there skittles somewhere?
I don't know what they're doing of, I haven't a clue
yeah more than one though
Well he normally gives a little er
mm
So, right here
Pretty busy in there isn't it?
Eh?
Pretty busy in that restaurant
Well people do go out to restaurants
Mm
I think it's marvellous they go out to a restaurant
Mm
but
really, have you?
Can't can I go on me own
Of course you can
You can't go on your own, what's, what's there in it going on your own?
oh I know, please
mm?
stuck, he's stuck again  isn't he?


oh you might get him interested in different things
Ha, what
you never know
Could do
you're never too old to change
I'm not so sure about that one
Oh well  oh dear
It was good weren't it?
It's brilliant 
But er Helen, she missed the best one, ah?
It was better than the other one, it might of been the seats but I don't think so because I mean there was so much in this one
Yeah
I mean the other was a nice story, but, I think this year's is better
more for the show
Yeah it was more of a show than a story weren't it?
But there was something
It brought you to the place and then
Yeah
and then it just it
Yeah
erupted
Yeah it did  my feet ache now
My feet are aching now, I've got thick tights on
shoes
I know
but I didn't know how cold it'll be, but
That's not a brilliant idea 
you see , no it isn't a brilliant idea but the thing is we didn't have much further to walk can we?
Yes
We could of done
the what?
I think
yeah, you are, great 
oh I put my half off, I doubt if I get my feet back in them, but, yeah
  

oh dear
ah so you are, sure you will, sure you will
Then I can sew it up and I've only got the
One sleeve, oh
one sleeve
it's gonna be a good one you know
I hope so
I can see it, you know, it looks it right
When it gets the toggles on it should be okay
The what?
When it gets the toggles on it should be okay 
Yeah , but it looks like it's gonna be good some of them 
I don't know what one to do next really
Well you'll have to decide I mean you 
I think I'll do another plain one, but this one, some were plain
Yeah 
but 
mm
erm, that chunky one
Yeah
it's not just plain, there's so many stitches  erm stocking stitch and so many rib
Mm
so
Mm
it'll have some pattern but not
terrific amount
a terrific
mm
cos it has two bands of rib
Yeah  oh, oh, oh god  well 
Then you can help me unpick it
Well that won't take long to unpick it will it?
No  it hadn't been knitted up too long
No
that's what I don't want for it to er
Yeah
crinkle too quickly
Yeah, anyway once it's washed it's all gone anyway
Oh yeah 
so really that's not a problem
No  but as you, I'll use that what's not a
ha, ha, I bet you will, it won't take that long to unpick it though  but I mean you've got a, quite a selection there to choose haven't you?
Yeah, oh if I can undo that one then I can do the sleeve
Mm
cos that'll be quite
Mm?
that will be quite intra intricate
Yeah, not much bigger job anyway, innit?
Yeah
Well I'll look, I'll see how much of that plum is left
I think there's quite a lot of plum and
you can't use that much can you?
I think it was two balls
Plenty then innit?
For that and 
and you've got two, well what was in them?
You would of got two cos you would of been a big one won't you?
Just that colour
That's right, but I mean all I want it for is the erm
Body
the body and use the black
Two black feet
That's right  I think it looked very effective what that woman had on
Yeah
so
can do one like that with that mustard up the top shelf 
Yeah it's nice innit?
with the black
That would stand out wouldn't it?
Yeah
That would be nice, you won't want that much for the sleeve
of black, so, do anything with black for ages
I saw your Andrew the other day
Eh?
I would think Andrew doing some
 
Probably would 
three pound balls and three pound thirty, er three pound twenty seven
How much was it nine?
Yeah it was nine, that's right, no it could be quite interesting actually, and then the other way
Or then you'd do like the four, four, four flares
Yeah
flat back
Yeah, it's limitless innit, but the other way is to do right down the centre, one on one and one on the other
Yeah 
reverse it on the back or have the same on the back
No what, what you normally do with those is er, say one half black and one half yellow and you have a yellow sleeve that side
Yeah
and a black sleeve that side
that's right , limitless innit?
But it would be wise to use the plum before I got the cerise or the sea green
Well it would
Yeah, of course it would, well it only sat there anyway again innit?
Of course it does


haven't we?
Well we always do, I mean if you'd use all that was in that cupboard you'd have half a dozen jumpers
I know
Yeah
Well I shall use the mohair next
Yeah, well there must be a fair amount of mohair
There is 
I mean that was an exceptionally good buy weren't it?
Well what I want is the black and the cerise
Mm 
because I'm not sure whether to put all different colours in
Well I think, I'd just experiment
or the black and the cerise and all the jacquards 
but you must yeah
because that could be quite effective
That would be effective, but I mean you don't want to do any that you've got to unpick, no that 
 
is not viable that
Yeah, that's why I think if I did all the jacquard in the cerise
Mm
that would show up beautiful
Mm, yeah I think it would
because what they've done on that pattern, why they've got so many different colours, where it mixes so you've got your red and your 
Mm 
green, they've got like an orangey
Yeah
you know where it crosses
Yeah
you know like that one of Howard's jumper
Yeah, yeah
well they've got it so that the colours in the middle
Sort of mingle
mingle
Yeah
and like you've sort of got a yellow and a green, they've put like an olive in that, an olive colour, but I haven't got colours that I can
No
mix like that 
not like that no
No, that's the thing
Oh well, oh, as long as you don't have to unpick, because that is awful
Oh I know
It's just a mess innit after?
Yeah, but I don't know it'll be quite effective
Yeah, oh yeah, but as I say it's limitless really
Yeah
especially with a
unless I go up that shop, top shop and have a look at those gramme balls, yellow, oranges
Yeah
red and got those to put in the black
Yeah
but there again my er 
How much were they?
Ninety nine P
Oh, that's not so bad is it?
No but there again
But there again you're buying again
Well I'd put in the cerise and have all the jacquard colours, it, it would look very effective
Mm it certainly would, it doesn't have to be different colours
No, no it doesn't  how many black ones are there?
I can't remember
Two
No I don't think there was two
No just one
I think there was only one because they only had one, and I got one white cos they only had one I think, it was the other colours I'm sure I'd got two of, I must of done, cos I mean I've used a lot myself don't I?
Yeah 
No I, I would think the black and the white were one, but mind you it goes a long blinking way don't it?
Well I
yeah  but I think it was only one and one of those two, I, I'd picked the white up because there wasn't any black, for that first time
Mm
because I thought that was neutral didn't I?
Erm
I don't know if I had them or not
I wonder if I've seen one of those
Three hundred again I think   it was  it was six balls weren't it?
Two, four, six
but they want seven and I want to put that big bit at the bottom.
Have I used any black?
I haven't have I?
No 
No 
Or was it seventy five ball?
I dunno
No
I think it was fifty, I do, but I'm not sure  oh perhaps if we can get over there at the end of the, well it's the end of the month next week anyway innit?
Oh
I mean, you don't know what they've got over there now do you?
I mean basically we go there and the meat shop don't we?
Yeah
There's not much else we want to look around at is there?
We wanna look at shoes
Shoes I
yeah
But then again it's not a brilliant idea going on a
for wool when we've got so many
Oh yeah
cos we'll come back loaded up 
haven't got it right actually, I mean basically we can go up the top shop and buy what we like can't we?
Get one, O nine, I mean providing you've got enough to do what you want to do in mohair
I don't know
no you'd have to get all out and have a look, but I mean if I go over there I'll bring back a load of D K and I know I will  we'll see.
Well you see the trouble is when we're buying it over there right
You get the left overs
we buy six hundred
Six hundred, yeah
which is two hundred per person 
Yeah, well you see it's quite a point you know, cos if we go up the top shop, we just, well the most I would buy is four
Well that's four pound, four pound 
Well that's what four pound and four nines 
Forty 
thirty six
Four pound thirty six where you'd pay two pounds, four pounds for two hundred grammes
mm, dunno well we'll see anyway, it depends on you and what you're doing
But there again it's better wool that you're buying from the
What, at the top shop?
Yeah
yeah
Yeah, that's a very old make you know, that one's been going for donkey years, but it's those colours, I mean there's at least, well with the o 
Well the trouble is we go over there and we buy a good buy
Mm
but it might not be the colours that we're actually looking for 
Well I, I'm sure it wouldn't be, what did I say I said that sea green and the cerise
And I said the mustard
The mustard and the beigey one weren't it?
Yeah
Er oatmeal
Er, yeah
Well that's, that's two jumpers each innit?
Yeah
I mean I've got plenty of black, so mustard and black whatever, whatever, cerise and black or something, that's daft really you know
It's very silly
I mean nine times out of ten we erm, we just go over there and buy what's there
Yeah
regardless when we come back well what are you going to make with it?
See, that's what I've bought patterns now
Yeah, no well I think that, thinking about it seriously now
What I want to find one is one without a well
Without a well?
Yeah, so it can hang over trousers
Oh I see
A long one
What like a sweat top or some of them does 
Yeah, yeah 
but I er 
We know that one, that woman was wearing that white one 
Yeah yeah, yeah
now something like that, that can go over a skirt
Or anything and it's very versatile
Yeah
No, thinking about it seriously it would be better to go up there, have a swifty through patterns you know, you need a bit of time
Yeah
you need a bit of time
but then again it'll take me longer to find that one this morning
Oh, that was when I was waiting in the queue weren't it?
Yeah
Mm, it really 
it caught my eye and I thought well
Yeah, it really is stupid having all these left overs, alright as I said before I can make all that kid stuff, but in the end I've got too much to take over
Yeah  and then again you don't always wanna, erm start all along, with them do you?
No
And then you've got different colours that don't really go with that, but 
Anyway I mean I've got a fair pile now to take in August ain't I?
Yeah 
No I, well the, the colours that I like you know the cerise and the
Yeah
the green, I can, I, he's says to buy four of them without thinking about it cos they're so nice and that's really the thing that we don't do when we go to Basingstoke we start going around saying well which one shall I have, but they said that you haven't looked at it like I've looked at those and you looked at yours because that oatmeal colour will be very, very handy for erm sticking with anything and everything
Yeah
Well I mean I've looked round here for a pair of blinking shoes, the only trouble here er had over here is that I've got to go somewhere where they're wide enough and that's
Littlewoods innit?
The only ones here that did a wider fitting that one, er at the time I bought some, well those with the gold on the back was Stead and Simpson and they did a wider fitting, but I don't know anybody else, but they may now
Probably do now
they may now, but erm, I mean these I've got on are Williams, they're an E fit that I, I particularly sent away for
Yeah
Well I don't want to do that any more cos you've got to wait three damn weeks nearly for the blasted things to come and then if they're no good you've got to send them back.
Yeah, but there again you see  they're, you're not going into a shop saying oh they look nice
No, anyway those plimsolls they're, they're alright
Yeah 
now I said the others, they've got to be lace-ups though look, it's gotta be lace-ups 
It must be easier to find wider
Yeah because I mean if there, if you've got a high instep it still don't matter because you only widen your laces don't you?
Yeah 
Well perhaps I'll have a look in town next Friday then, I could definitely do with a pair
Well we could even, oh dear  we could even go
oh dear
yeah
don't we?
yeah  yeah we do cos it's there innit?
Quite right
If we're gonna spend money you might as well go to Littlewoods or
Mm
somewhere where it's decent
Mm, same, the same situation as those clothes
Yeah
weren't it?
Oh I didn't like them I was, I could see them riding up the leg just like that pair I had on that day and in the end they look so grey and they look like
I had a doggy bag the other day
Eh?
doggy bag when their
yeah
in the end they do
Yeah they do  but they, those others I was quite, you didn't try them on so I
No I forgot I was downstairs weren't I so?
buy one tomorrow  but the material is better and the shape is better
Yeah
and the stirrups are nice
They're smart aren't they?
Yeah
But they've got to be long enough in the leg for me
Yeah they have, but there was people the other night with that type trouser on and boots
Yeah
Yeah  when I went in the ladies loo there was one woman in there and they did look nice
Cord ones are beautiful
Yeah well there again like I said before I tend to rub the cord and then they all
Everybody does
Yeah I know
They are very stylish
Yeah  I've got mine back on now
Eh?
I've got mine back on, but it won't be long when I get out the bus mind, but 
Say?
I said I'll put my shoes back on but I don't know what my feet will be like when I get out the bus
yeah it's strange innit coming back?
It's just as 
Yeah but it's a clearer road as well 
Yeah, that's, that's fair, yeah, just a different proposition innit?
Well yes they're all sort of bubbly to get out there
Yeah
We've seen it now were tired
Not tired now, but I shall want a cup of tea
Oh yeah
I might have a sausage roll   the sandwiches are alright, but you can eat them twice as many can't you?
Yeah
You know when they're packed up like that
I think cos they're packed up and they're all fresh and
Mm 
put the lettuce in and put the tomato in 
That's right 
and then
Oh they weren't bad at all 
No they were very nice
Mm, weren't bad at all, oh I had had something
but I, I couldn't of ate before we came out
No, but I wish I'd brought the pork pies with me, I could of taken that, one of them
Yes
I might eat one when I get out
yeah, well whatever, just something otherwise you get up in the morning and you're starving aren't you?
Still it was well worth coming up here tonight.
Oh yes   oh yeah  
Hello the thinner is really, really easy tomorrow
Probably do a
or something
Yeah could do, that's a good idea
cos that'll fill won't it?
Yeah, I know 
You won't have as much
Oh no, we've got that other cake of yours
Oh yeah 
No, better have your cake
Have my cake?
Mm
Well it can stay in there
Well we'll have a look at it and we might have both 
No I don't think you'll have both
Why not?
Eat it in the evening?
Eat one of them, I, we have one afternoon like we usually do, we'll have a look at it and see how big it is and all that, yours, and we'll go from there, I mean actually for us three that trifle will only do that, they're never that, that big
No
Oh, I mean if you want to put a tin of fruit with it
Yeah but that, that makes it large, large
We'll have a look at the coffee thing
That looked a bit scrumptious that 
Yeah I'm surprised at him
Eh, start thinking about as much as


I guess I'll give him a kick up the arse if he
 

Oh he won't say no to me
Oh
Not very often anyway
Oh 
erm 
That's right 
yet?
Yeah
No
Yeah he is 
it won't be long
Well we'll soon know if he snores 
oh he's awake then 
Well he was
nodding
Oh what's the time then?
Oh I don't know, I don't know 
Nearly eleven, this stop
It is, I make it a couple of minutes past
No, I think it's a good run, it can't be that late
Oh, we'll be in well before twelve
I hope so, yeah  I wonder where we are then?
Isn't it clever how they changed the co costumes, er like that pink
What with the lines?
With the black, you know it had the black bit as well 
Oh yes , that was brilliant I mean that man, what's his name?
or something
A brilliant programme wasn't it?
Yes, always worthwhile getting one
It is, I slipped up on chess one 
That was at the front
I slipped up on that chess one I got the black and white one
 
yeah 
Velcro
Velcro
that's probably his professional name innit?
Yeah, that was her favourite one that was
Zoe's was it?
I think that was very clever, very, very clever
That's the one I liked  brilliant aren't they?
Well they are
make a thing like that  take it to work and show the girls
She was brilliant
Yes she was
I think that, which one was the other one that was
I don't know because I said to you  oh I had a super view
Yeah
that's gorgeous that is
They look ever so perfect 
have those two colours together brilliant
Yeah
brilliant
They're ever so heavy them aren't they?
Yeah I bet
Well they'll last for a long time
Mm, that one, I don't know though  didn't have a blonde woman see and I never, I didn't, I didn't realise there was two and I really did not and I suddenly there's, they all come out on the ice 
I think 
didn't they?
I'd be surprised if she never get erm, her mansion in her
Her what?
her sort of own mansion 
Unless she was one of the poorest
She shouldn't be
Well no she shouldn't be but since going she just suddenly appeared didn't she?
Yeah  that one
Yeah but that was the dark haired one weren't it?
Don't matter, must of had it done
Eh?
I think she's had it highlighted
Oh
If you look at her face she had quite a pointed nose
Oh, no I didn't really matter
That her?
she's in Washington 
is it really?
Is she?
Seattle
Mm  I don't know then
Oh this one Jane Taylor
Yeah
A bella blo , blonde from Whitney Bay 
I've got a feeling 
cos they do, but when 
rings a bell
The top trainers at home and abroad, Claire Hurst, the National and International Championships , I've seen her on ice on the
Oh I thought oh I, I, I seemed to remember the Whitney Bay bit and I mean I don't know what I've done with the blinking programme last year, I mean they're all in the magazine rack, but I don't think that one's there  that was terrific that weren't it?
Oh when I had this one it went over to
oh
didn't it?
Oh that's been and gone then innit?
I didn't think of that you know
Unfortunately it went 
Yeah that's right , and I thought to myself what if, I wouldn't of thrown it away, I keep all my programmes
We should of got two really shouldn't we?
Never thought of that you know  oh well, where you going
We learn a lot of things  but then again as I say
There it goes innit?
Yeah, have some good times

That she
That was awful them
weren't it?
Well it has to give the effect 
Cor dear me , straight out
it has to give you that effect  I thought it was marvellous
eh?
I thought it was marvellous
So did I, well that's certainly worth the money, I know it's a lot of money 
Oh yeah 
but, you do it, if you think of it individually, what are you gonna do for that money anywhere else?
Exactly
I mean we all saved what one fifty each on it?
It's thirteen fifty a ticket, it's erm, I don't think you can moan at a night out for that, especially a night out like that
What was that?
 

Anyway nobody's gonna want to get up tomorrow
Sorry?
Nobody's gonna want to get up tomorrow 
Oh well shame
I didn't want to get up this morning so
I said to
I said to Ernie  oh you'll have to go and call her
of getting out weren't it?
But we were out, he was very good, I mean I know he was waiting there for us
But not really
with all things considered we did a lot didn't we?
Yeah
And I forgot that plastic card didn't I?
Anyway I get the opportunity, oh you didn't look in that box for that baby
well we'll have a look first, but we do want salad cream don't we?
Yeah  got lettuce to eat
Mm
so we've got to get some  Oh we'll have to go somewhere snazzy cos I've got that black dress to wear haven't I?
Oh big dance
Eh?
big dance in May
Can't wear that again
Oh you wore it there didn't you?
Yeah
Oh
have to wear it to Kate's
Yeah, that's an idea
sell it to them one of them at work


doesn't it?
Mm, I expect so, yeah 
You see
No at Kate's it'll be nice won't it?
And hopeful the weather will be better
I just have to make sure Mitch is nowhere near
Er actually I don't even know if he'll go
Oh I expect so, I expect so 
er they'll be plenty of other people there for god sake, I mean
Oh, he's slimy though
Mm, well he'll probably be there on Tuesday again, that's what he said
No that'll be the third time
No, yeah, well that'd be twice we've seen him
Oh yeah
looks like 
looks like him 
looks like his night, don't it?
Er
Probably goes in
have a look, cos he's got to be thirty something, I don't know what now
Oh I don't know , you got
Yeah  
Yes 
Don't let me swim on my back on Thursday
Why?
If I swim on my back I don't do my front
Yeah well it's not really the wisest thing to do on a Thursday night anyway
I cheat when I swim on my back
Yeah, but not only that when you get a couple of dickheads like we had
Oh I know
you know you've got to watch them, they're not watching you, you've got to watch them
That's what puts me off, when we have those two
Yeah
and we went on that other side
Well we'll have to watch it this week and if er
That annoys me when I get 
Yeah 
people like that
Well it does me on a night like that, because the majority of people are either having a damn good lazy swim
But there's the lanes, there are nights when it's just even lanes 
I know yeah
so they just have
no, very annoying that, I mean that bloke going backwards and forwards is bad enough but 
Oh he's a right pain
but then obviously that's all he does or what he does  I mean which is
Yeah, but he's not a bad swimmer
Well he don't seem to be a bad swimmer at all he really don't 
he just don't like going down to the deep end 
Maybe  but it is difficult when people do that because I mean the majority of us are going up and down and you get this one that's going across and 
 
but the majority of people on a Tuesday night are going for a leisurely swim aren't they?
Yeah, they're going for a swim
Yeah
but
but not tearing about, anyway if they're
of course I mean it'll be a little different this week, won't it?
Yeah, well you're gonna go again Tue er Monday
No
Oh dear 
You never know Liz might come tomorrow
Tomorrow?
er Monday 
Might, well
quarter past gone anyway  don't even know where we are actually
Just gone past Mick's Services
Have we?
oh dear, dear me 
oh don't do that 
yes
I think I'll have a look at this lot tomorrow actually
Yeah
It's nice to read them because you know
shame we couldn't got one of them other ones last year
Yeah, I never though of that and I doubt if I get it now, all I think was well I know that I got it in the magazine rack
Well have a look down there, it's just by the fridge and the card
I tell you what erm, that'll have to be done by that, that cake thing you bought
Oh yeah
I never took one blinking photograph did I?
Why not?
People did though didn't they, anything you want down the shop?
Pardon?
Anything you need down the shop?
No I don't want
Nothing
What did Ann then just wanted to talk?
Er no er it was about that jumper look
Oh of course yeah of course you wrote her didn't you?
Yeah and er , yeah and she said I love the colours but it's coming out, it comes out a forty eight inch 
Yeah , yeah
and she said if I could try it before oh, er
What?
no she said erm, if, if I could try it oh I wait until that blessed lot's gone
Do what?
all that blasted lot out here
Oh
erm, no she said if I could try it
Mm
erm have it made and try it
Yeah
she said well then, then that'll be fine 
Yeah 
but I said to her oh I don't think I'd have it done
No
forty over pounds
Yeah just well
and a forty eight 
gotta buy gotta buy a new one innit?
Well that's what I said to her you'll probably find something around, but I mean it was a nice, it is a nice pattern
Yeah
but there's nothing smaller than the first size
Ha
and also she said she's heard from Pauline
Yeah
and they were all fine, erm getting on with that place as good as they can
Yeah
because erm they haven't heard about their extension
No
and erm, she said er Pauline asked where your mother's coffee set was, little coffee cups and all that and I said I don't know I've never seen one
Yes 
well I've never seen a coffee set
No
she said it was all packed up in a box and I said well you wouldn't see it then would you?
Yeah, no 
And she said er, I said what she want it then?
So she said well must of just thought about it
Yeah she wants it mm
and she'd like it and so she well I'll ask Jean
Mm
erm Jean might be going out to see that new Marks & Spencer's somewhere, there's a new big one being built out
Yeah
it's, it's not Anne's way but it's not far I don't think 
No, yeah 
and she might take Daphne with her
Yeah
and she said she'd ask them
Mm
but er
Well I don't know what she's talking about
I don't know
Yeah
what she's talking about you know, because I said well the bits that Daphne brought here
Yeah, well I say er I mean obviously Pauline remembers it from some when don't she?
Well that's right, I mean how, how long ago nobody knows 
 
must of been one mustn't they?
Ah?
I said there must of been one
Oh yeah, yeah, certainly
but it, it don't ring a bell with me
Well I, I mean if it was wrapped up in a box
Yeah
but Ann said erm perhaps she gave it away well she did 
Yeah, she did give some away
she did give Mrs  didn't she?
I mean I remembered some of it, I, I remember hearing something that she'd given some bits downstairs 
Yeah, yeah yeah
but erm, I said well I dunno, I said I, I don't ever remember seeing it
No
but at the same time if it was, if it's in boxes you
Well you wouldn't
you're not gonna see it
No
but Pauline must of remembered it perhaps for the
All the times your mum had
well any of you
Yeah
I mean
wouldn't get nothing out like that
Yeah
it must be something that they've had er they 
Yeah 
had for years and erm, you know
Yep
packed away in a box, but I suppose Pauline thought about it
Yeah
so the problem is if nobody knows about it you start that all over again
Mm
don't you?
Yeah
Cos you know that, that happened before
Yeah
when that, over the teapot
Yeah
at er, I, I don't remember anything, anything at all, but she said, I told her about the baby, she didn't know about that
Yeah
and er, she said I, I said have you heard from Paul, because the last time I spoke to her she hadn't
No
and she said yeah he's fine he's having a super time
Yeah
and she's heard from Tanya, one letter
Oh
and er she was with Colin
Yeah
but now she's moving on, and another girl's going out this week or next week to er join them
Yeah
so, that'll be about three I think
Ha
I can't remember, three of four perhaps
Yeah
and er she said I won't hear for a while because they're gonna move on now
Yeah
but
Where they going now?
Ah?
Where they going from Malta then?
They're not in Malta they're in Australia

I didn't see on there really
Mm?
I said I didn't see on there
Oh I see
I know
yeah
oh I see 
Should be about right shouldn't it?
Mm, looks like it, pretty little cardigan innit?
Mm
actually down there you know
I'm not
what you do, cos I've got to finish on the other side
Mm, mm
so that I'll
mm, I've got a long way to go yet then have I?
Not if erm, the longer the jumper it looks
Well
doesn't it?
wear it on, you don't know do you?
I'm quite sure I don't
I don't know much about it
No
but as I say I've sat and done this 
Mm 
cos I wanna do something else
That's right 
like that?
Ann said hold on to the pattern, she said I don't know what to do, erm knit them
I know how she's done it, yeah
Well if I did all that again
Yeah
that's gonna be quite 
well you'll have to see how much black there is cos
that'll be quite effective won't it?
Mm
But you see I want to put that extra bit on the bottom you see 
Mm , well if there's only one pocket which I'm sure there is you won't have enough
No 
Is the back quite
I don't know
It's a good way of doing it, innit, there's no messing about is there?
oh 
No start again
Oh it is, oh
mm
follow the pattern, but there again this stuff goes a long way
Mm, it does
so I might chance it
What's the needles?
Fours and four and a half
Mm
so it's not double knit?
No, oh no, did I try it on smaller needles?
No I tried it on smaller needles 
You did 
but that was on tens, I've done it on tens
Mm
but
oh you did
It's just a bastard to do this rib
Yeah
and get the rib going 
Yeah I don't remember whether it was you or, or me 
cos ours was seven red er seven blue, black
Mm 
but if it knitted sort of like it did not before
Yeah well you can leave out the pattern there can't you?
Yeah
Just in case you, I reckon, I think it's too big
Cor, that would be
Mm
I wonder why, whether it would be too striking
Not with the colours you've got I wouldn't of thought
No with erm, just the purple, you know I was gonna do it all cerise
Mm, I dunno what
No
because the black's gonna take it off innit?
The black should take it off
Mm certainly  cor look at that
Awful innit?
Oh god, were it erm
awful
Mm  that's where they are, all
yeah  cor let's have a look now and see whether

Mm
I said he can't take any more than what there is cos there ain't no more 
Flipper
Mm
yeah


Mm, what, something I what I was watching the other night erm, what on earth was, something, it was nineteen forty seven that were, it was er, it was an old repeat
Mm
nineteen forty seven I saw the thing, not a film, a, a show
A show?
and I thought bloody hell
Bloody hell I mean a show
 
Yeah, that's that's a long
 
I mean we've got an old Errol Flynn there
Yeah, ah films I mean you expect to go back, but this is, what on earth was that?
Er what like a variety or what?
Mm
or perhaps a quiz show that started then, you know.
When's that Des O'Connor thing on then?
That Michael Miles thing?
When is it?
Mm
Dunno
Not to, I know we saw it the other night didn't we?
Yeah , yeah
I wonder
That's not bad is it?
Miss Saigon with tickets, with staying 
A lot about erm
forty two fifty
it was on about, last night on
he'd obviously been talking about, erm
people, they're trying to get a trip done, Aspect of Love
What's that one then?
Quarter past 
That one that Michael Ball sang in, that, that
Erm Andrew Lloyd Webber's
Mm
other one
Mm
with his wife
Mm
What 
in 
Sarah Brightman?
Yeah
Oh that's fair innit
yeah
But there again
but they erm, I told what, that never arrange it and then borrow some figures
Why that's right, I mean that might be the best idea in the end
Well yeah, we, we talk about it but 
didn't it?
Yeah I know they did talk about this Doreen and Owen, because er
Michael has told us down the pub, if they had more than a week's notice
Yeah
Well no, that's right
Erm I'm not, you know erm, I mean 
Well this is why 
er Rose would of had all four if she'd of known about it earlier
But the thing is Mick you've gotta get, you know yourself sorted early enough
Yeah, that's right
and if people don't pay then they lose them
If they all said yeah we'll go for them 
As I say, if they said , you know I mean I, I don't know whether that much will take a lot 
Typically it's their own bloody fault 
but drop, pop it over one look
innit?
Well I mean when they put their names down they 
Yeah I, I don't care it happening again I tell you that
Well no I'm sure it won't
Well it's been a
What?
it's, it's been hassle because
Do you want any more of these Bev?
only we, we lost sixty, sixty five pound yesterday 
Yeah 
didn't we?
Sixty three pound
Yeah, but the whole point
You can go Bruges
Oh
you know that's where
Yeah, but the whole point Mick is, it's hassle
Yeah, yeah
innit?
Yeah
I mean
 
and the annoying part about it
yeah, well, that
for both shows because there was an extra demand
Yeah, but that in itself gotta stop
Yeah
that
Yeah
aspect of it has gotta
Yeah, I mean we, we've turned to thirty three this time because it's a thirty three seater
Now that can be the erm 
Now I know it's a funny thing but this time because of demand it was forty eight, now alright out of that forty eight three was still, right one was in hospital so you can
Well no you're gonna get this all 
Yeah 
the time
Yeah
but er Jill gave her her money back
But the whole point is Mick you are stipulating
Yeah
an X-seater
Yeah
coach and if it comes out like Helen and Pete like that and they're, they're gone and the others haven't, no wonder it's been up on your wall
Yeah that's right
but the whole point is you see, if er
For bedsit there's a demand for the Chippendales now then
Yes she's got a list did you know?
Yeah
yeah, well I thought she had one at
mm
innit?
Mm
But the only thing, the, the next thing is now collecting the money early enough 
Mm 
and what is that June?
Oh I don't know when that was cos we
June weren't it Bev?
Eleventh I think it is well anyway 
I know 
 
It's a Thursday 
it's a coach
it's a Thursday
June's
 
I know it's it's the sixth of June
And we shall shortly be do our
right
And the only thing we've got on, I mean after tonight er it's got nothing to do with me anyway
Kate's was June the sixth, June the seventh was the
June the eleventh is it, if June the eleventh is a Thursday then that's June the eleventh 
That's the, that's the one 
Mm
Yeah, Kate's anniversary is the
July I thought that was
No
They've just got land I think now.
And the bungalow's too big!
I mean it's erm  either get  one or two bedroomed bungalow can't you?
Yeah, and I say, you know I mean obviously it's too big but I mean not from  from the point of view that  the buildings are right outside of them ain't they?
Mm.
I think that's what  er,i as much as anything to spoil them.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But I mean I, I see no point in all of us going out and looking for presents.
Mm.
No.
Cos you only come round with
Oh wha 
little bits and
I mean, if we spent a tenner each.
I know you get nothing for a tenner but if you spend hundred pound  you can 
You do.
get something quite nice for a hundred pound.
Well I mean , but and then, I I don't know how much that garden furniture  costs.
That
That, I mean you know it's pretty erm 
Yeah .
it can be  pretty 
I know.
pricey because of what Glen and George bought!
Well wha , I mean before we never had a hammock weren't it?
That's right.
Cos it got a bit pricey so I thought, we could of bought one  about half.
Yeah, but I, no, I did.
Yeah.
We'd have had one but  they got dearer and dearer and dearer!
Yeah, but there was no  Mick.
I mean th , the amount of time we have to sit in the blasted garden anyway  is er  nothing innit?
I must remember that though because erm  I mean to gi give our erm  erm
Time.
some time  or all three of them.
When do you go down town?
Friday.
Oh, not before?
Well I don't know.
Why?
Er, well, if you do and erm  don't go special, because it's er  not essen er, it's my turn to buy the  draw prizes.
I had a quick look round yesterday but I ain't got a clue!
And what what 
But anything up to you know, ten fifteen pound.
Fi , pay fifteen pound first prize.
Don't matter about the rest, there's some in the bird box  I can fill in, but I can't just
Well, isn't the Argos book out yet?
Mm.
Yeah, suppose so.
I mean, the Arg 
I dunno.
Argos book's got 
Yeah.
everything!
Yeah.
You can sit here
Yeah.

Yeah.
on.
Yeah.
I'll  
Well what sort of thing?
What do you want men and women 
 
or 
Well 
.
I mean the 
is it 
Because we had more money, we spent more money last time, we bought a  erm  a men's and a lady's watch and that went down a treat.
Yeah, well cos that's that's 
Well Tony won it but I mean it still went down a treat.
What , so it's not
You want something that's universal for the first one.
Well not necessarily that, I mean, people buy when they go, I mean, I've always just gone straight away and got a nice bit bottle of booze  and er
Yeah well something like, that can get boring!
Wanna drink some drink and that.
But I I I'll sell more on the shop floor.
But I won't sell so many in the office.
No.
No.
No, I mean it can get a bit of a boring 
Yeah.
Yeah.
not got .
I mean round Christmas and that
See it's 
it's  it's a bit of 
Well 
but I mean there's so much in here.
And I mean, obviously  I'm not saying that you ought to buy it anywhere else
No.
but  but I mean I've got prizes of

Well what the whole thing is they put 
Get something for us out of that.
You know,i i 
They've gotta be willing to part with that bit of money.

But that don't matter cos the same ones buy er  whatever it is.
But you do like to ha , give them something that  will be useful to them.

Yeah.
And  whilst she bought the  the first one last week, Yvette, did the rest.
Does she?
Mm.
So you're actually looking for one thing?
And then, then I will just fill in with the rest.
Then you do get bottles of wine and  boxes of 
What about a clock?
We done it before.
But unless it's a, no well  if it's a nice one then
Hell of a selection!
I know they're dear ones but  I don't think there's any more on the previous page to that one though.
But it's a nice drawer I would think.
If it's a, if it's a nice
I mean  I presume they do  erm  .
That's a .
Yes, no I'm right.
I'm sure they do them, cos you can get them on the  Christmas club can't you?

What's that?
That's a bit dear!
Yeah.

Because that thing didn't know what to do any more!
No, well that's a 
I bet a video recorder is now down within that  range, virtually!
Settle for something.
I mean it's not the best.
And you get them hundred and fifty odd quid can't you now?
And we  one before 
That one was only 
because they were  too much!
Too dear!

A lot of people now are collecting those.
But there's two big
As I say, I er  well I've just said to you, I mean er  we sell  forty odd quids worth to blokes.

Oh good!
Not everybody wants it.
Well no, not everybody wants that sort of thing.
Well not everybody likes them.
No, that's right!
Anyway, what .

See how it is.
Oh yes, that's your best bet Mick.
Mm.
Oh that's 
And 
those two big clocks there.
That was  
That would make a nice additive to anybody's house.
That's it.
Mm.
I would say so.
I mean, that thing is with Argos Mick it saves you walking round the blasted town!
Well that's right!
You know I mean
Well, as I say, I've been all down through the  .

Well it's not necessary at all!
And anyway, if you, if you run in  if you say

Just let's say  it's one of these wall clocks.
All you gotta do is is just phone up and give them your
Well
Er, just to make sure that it's there.

But, failing that, you know, if yo if you're going in town anyway I can write the ticket out cos I got one here
Mm.

Mm.
But if you phone up and they've got one they reserve it for you but you have to get it  that day, weren't it Bev?
So what's your next erm  they were asking on the .
What's your next  item then?

Well erm  I put another tripper on that.

No.
Two, four, six, eight, ten, twelve, fourteen, sixteen  twenty two.
Two, four, six, eight, ten, twelve, fourteen, sixteen  two, four, six, two, eight, two, fifty four, fifty five  fifty five.
Eight, ten  mm mm.

Two, four, six, eight, ten, twelve, fourteen, sixteen, eighteen, twenty, twenty two, twenty four, twenty six, twenty eight  thirty, two, thirty four, thirty six, thirty seven
I'll be able to sew this up this afternoon.

Yeah.
Oh yeah, that's good!
And this'll be your easier one to sew up cos it's blue.
Yeah.
These spuds aren't much good you know.
No?
I'll have to tell him, no!
He probably have to go out to where Simon went .
Yeah.
No, they're ripe like hell!
Well it's been a very cold, cold winter.
I know.
It's been ice cold that's why.
Yep.
Mind you, I still say I like the reds.
Yeah.
They're a much better potato.
Well if I go on like this we'll be getting another bag next week!
Oh dear!actually there but you know what I mean.
Yeah.
Right.
I'll go and look at that  potato thing  and the meat and then  I'll see.
See what we have to do cos the meat won't take long will it?
Shouldn't do.
I'll give Lesley a ring in a minute.
Yeah.
Cos she ought to be down there this morning didn't she?
We haven't seen Helen for ages now have we?
No ho.
When she come up with them photos I suppose  was the last time weren't it?
Must of been mustn't it, that day?
Yeah.
What the hell is microwave film?
It's a load of shit!
What is that then?
Gotta have it.
You've got to have it?
Yeah.
No, it's still in there, this is,gotta go in the fridge for four hours.
It's like cling film  but it's microwave .
Well what if I don't get it?
Must have it do you?
Yeah , it says it!
Take it out the foil tray  erm  put in a  well, a pyrex  and erm  cover with micro co microwave film.
Cover it with a  lid.
Does that matter?
I would imagine it's doing exactly the same.
Christ, it's only up , microwave film only just come out!
Has it?
It ain't been out that long.
Bring in your Microwave Know How.
Yeah.
This has gotta defrost for four hours in the fridge.
Oh well.
Good job I almost got it weren't it?
Dunno where I gotta put it, mind but still
It's probably cold enough out there to  be the fridge.
Ay?
I said it's probably cold enough out there.
No, well I'll put it in .
Where's the Microwave Know How then?
Ah?
That big one?
Yeah.
I can't reach it.
Bring me the little book, that might have it as well.
I can't reach the big one.
No, the little one.
Oh right.
Well I mean, they might sell it down the shop but  I never heard of it.
It says here
Mm.
Cover and wrapping, wrapping food.
Yeah.
What in there?
Ah?
In the microwave?
Yeah.
Yeah.
By covering  the food during microwave cooking you can speed up the cooking procedure.
This also prevents splattering and juices all over the cooker wall .
That's the gravy.
Yeah.
It would be, yeah.
Right.
Yeah?
There are several ways of covering food
Oh  right.
use a tight fit lid
Mm.
to a dish
Mm.
or use a saucer or plate to cover.
Mm.
Use cooking bag  cooking bags or roaster bag
Mm.
for vegetables  and meat.
Remember to replace the metal ties  provided with elastic band
Mm.
or string.
Mm.
Cling film, plastic wrap is inva , invaluable  to all microwave users.
But do remember  to puncture holes .
It's , it says that.
So  I would imagine  as long as you put a lid on it
Yeah.
it's doing exactly the same.
The same thing.
Do you do that when you do scrambled eggs then?
Do you put anything on it?
No.
No.
Why don't that  work the same then?
Because it cooks at the top and then cooks inwards.
Oh.
My , I better go down and get cling film I suppose.
I wouldn't bother!
Won't bother.
 
Well we just gotta find something that's prickable then to use ain't we?
Plates  in the
Yeah.
That's wha that's what it says?
Yeah.
I really wouldn't bother.
Mm.
Right.
I wouldn't cover that anyway.
So let the flavour out.
I tell you when he's coming but then I'd have the  cooker going up the   Swannee Well, well no.
Just say I've popped down to see the .
Yeah alright.
It's only just
Yeah.
No point in .
Yeah, that's a .
I'll say that he's gone.
Well   speaking on telephone h hello love!
It's Wendy.
Is mum there?
Alright?
Yeah.
Why's he acting like Sam ?
About to say watch out he might shout without moving the receiver!


And I said he didn't.
How are you?
Yeah.
Well we was coming down, now the cooker's gone up the  Swannee!
And he isn't erm, it lights up in the oven.
I ain't got no bloody oven at the moment.
It lights up but it erm  you turn to the regulo love  and it still stays  the same level which is  you know, sort of you know, little.
So I've got the gas man coming tomorrow but I doubt very much he'll be able to mend it tomorrow but  but we was, we're gonna try and get down.
She's ending up with a  getting on to job centres and all that, you know.
But ain't got nothing.
But er  yeah, you ain't got nothing?
No.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well tha that's right ee er, I mean th there is no point in sort of getting a aggravated about it is there?
None at all.
So I mean she's been waiting on that erm  place down  Junction Road but they, you know, we've had nothing from .
No.
Asked her if she's signed on at  Trevalle 
Lesley's had a letter to say from them  down the job place they ain't got nothing.
Er  Trevalle she's just said.
Have you heard of that one?
Tre , what is it?
 Trevalle 
 Trevalle Are you on that one?
Yeah, she's on it, yeah.
Job Spot?
Yeah.
You done the lot have you?
Like she has, yeah.
Yeah, well I say, it's one of those things, I mean, you get bad  but er  but there's bugger all you can do is there?
You know?
Aha.
Mm.
Well, well er well it is, because I mean so many go for the sa da damn same job don't they?
But  what about yours then, any  nothing?
You have?
Aha.
Mm.
Does it?
Yeah.
The other place.
Mm.
Really?
Ha.
Yeah see that's a problem because that's like  Greatley  Greatley and  Amport cos an an , Anne was saying that  wanted one in that  lot which is a similar, but she couldn't have one.
Yes, it's a  Yeah.
Yes.
It's all so petty!
Innit?
You know?
Ha.
Yeah.
Have they?
They, they wanna get shot of  well they've have to change their policies I think!
Oh have they?
Aha.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
Oh well that's not nice then is it?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
No.
No, it's around about the  off innit?
You know?
Yeah.
Still, never mind I I hopefully it's a chance, you know?
I mean erm  them solicitors sent a letter to him  we had a copy come here but erm, he's gotta pay her fifty pound a week.
We ain't heard nothing!
Nothing at all!
So I dunno how long they're supposed to let it go on, you know?
Tell her he phoned you.
Mm.
Well she's on income support look.
Thirty nine sixty something a, a week.
But erm  I, you know, he he phoned again.
I suppose Bev has told you this bit.
He phoned, and I answered the phone look  and erm  he changed the story, he said if she wants any money I'll let her have some.
And I said, too late!
I said you've got it writing  and in the solicitor's letter, she said in there that erm  he must get in, if he don't understand it or er don't agree or whatever  he must get the solicitor but er  ain't heard, ain't nothing a about it!
Not a thing!
Mm.
Totally, yeah!
Yeah.
Oh no,tha that's it, hundred percent!
They get enough fees!
Yeah.
Yeah.
Half hour.
So I mean  well I suppose it's, times flitting away cos I don't suppose her solicitor will let it go on forever!
They've taken out of him.
Yeah.
And they've taken out of his pay.
Anyway, but that means going to court won't it, you see?
Mm.
Well that's right!
Yeah.
Well she she reckons, you know, on the army and that he can well afford that!
And er  I say, I dunno, he might have got a solicitor, it might be all going on, who knows?
No.
No, it's just a case of sitting.
No.
Well, well that's right, I mean, I know she's gotta send it in, I mean it's nothing, but it's something.
Well nothing at all!
Yeah!
We see Jenny Tuesdays, have you seen her?
Yeah!
Well you get so bloody bored don't you?
You know?
It's a good night actually.
Er, she goes down with a friend.
Oh.

Be truthful.
Well  well let's face it, one of the girls I used to work with going up  , she never used a  ordinary oven.
Didn't she?
Nope!
Never!
Mm.
Well  if you're, if you're able to do what you wanna do in other ways.

Mm.
if they go along  they might get better as you go they might get worse, who kno , who knows!
But er
Oh isn't  good!
Well 
But 
it hurt but it's gonna feel .
They'll be a result somewhere.
Some of them, these are a bit hard in the middle you know.
What?
Spuds.
Spuds.
Mm, well I should of said, I mean like they used to.
That's right.
I did a few of the last ones but .
The thing is that when you erm  if you cut them down so much you are gonna have  total saute aren't you?
Did you  pre-cook them?
Yeah.
Mm.
Yeah, I did.
Mm.
Mm.
But I mean, it just means cutting them smaller actually.
Mm.
Don't you?

But, so she might stand a chance.
Cos in the end I mean they've gotta sell them ain't they?
They're growing up in the village.
And they've gone up from outside haven't they?
Mm.
They reckon
, sometimes the village  catchment is not

What do you mean?
I said well hell well you've got them going in there full pelt  you don't go in there to stop it!
And she said I can't hear them when I'm outside.
And I said, everybody can hear when they're walking down the pavement!
And er  I said to her, you know, you must realise that  when we're in here we can hear, no, you'd of thought they was in  around our feet!
Well I can't hear them!
She had the door open at the moment  with these bloody dogs yapping  and she looked at me and said I can't hear them!
So, I said to her right, I said  you wanna be in here  live in here  I said I'll invite you in!
And she went in and shut the door!
Well wha , that's it!
Mick said to me, what did she say?
What did she say?
So I told him!

I mean she had the door, the front door open!
At that
I'm surprised she couldn't even hear!
Oh!
I mean we have double glazing.
The idea if you've got double glazing
So have I!
And yes, I can hear at my front door next door but one  the window.
If somebody goes up their path and she barks you can hear it!
Well, I said to Mick, he's just got up now.
Oh, I said to him look  I said she obviously a person that takes no notice , but she lives out in the country.
Because she's in there!
When it goes on inside, she's in there!
I'm su sure she can't hear it.
She said I can't 
 
hear it when I'm out here.
So I said, well that's it!
I know he don't this Sandra  and I don't care a sod!
Bloody had a gutful of her!
I mean, for a start I don't think she should have four dogs shout out  in there all the hours that they are!
And er  I'm not saying they're ill treated  cos they're probably not, but there's different ways of ill treating isn't there?
I mean they don't look scruffy 
Certainly!
you get fed but that's about it!
And they're in the warm you can't say they're
No.
they're not .
Well I haven't seen her.
I saw her that one night look  take one of those little ones  going up the road  but I've, I mean  .
All these people there this weekend and I've not seen one dog go out!
And I mean you don't just stand at your window  but  at some time or other
Well she's probably sharing a room  with the dogs !
Well they must be!
It's like living in a dog's kennel!
It's only a three bedroomed bloody semi after all!
Well like living in a dog's 
Yeah!
kennel!
Yep!
So I said to him, right  I said we either  go  I mean I keep saying to him you've gotta do something about this!
Either this plaster board holes or whatever the house  well the trouble is it costs  such a lot of money
Yeah.
you know, and we are, we have got that insulating lot.
Oh it's  she's cantankerous!
She's  whatever you say  don't wanna know!
Well I was bloody livid!
I was really livid!
Who's the other side  of her?
Well th the bloke  but I mean he's not attached.
But he's out.
He's out
I was gonna say the people on the other si I know 
No!
they're not joined, so the other side never 
But he he always at work or somewhere!
You know, I mean he's only a single bloke.
Oh right.
Hiya Doreen!
Hello Doreen!
But I mean this week  er this weekend  er, Mr  died  opposite  erm, they've got a , a  detached house there  and erm  somebody went 
Oh I saw her in Norwich.
She was 
Did you?
I didn't know anything about it you see  and all of a sudden there's two  big black cars in the road  the other day 
He's probably paid for two.
I think Anne no 
I don't know.
you know?
Yeah.
I I 
Karen's sister
couldn't tell you but er  these cars turned up  erm, there weren't no hearse  and off they went and er  course when I went up the garden to get some washing in Claire  came up  and er  anyway she said er  about Mr  and I said well I assume it was him, I saw Mrs   and she starts on about this dog barking out in the garden again!
But she won't do nothing about it!
Oh!
One of them!
I said I had a damn good go at her yesterday afternoon!
Did you?
What did she say?
She said she didn't hear it!
She was out in the front  seeing as one of her umpteen people, I mean they must pack them in!
Yeah that car was still there on Friday parked, it's that brown one.
Doreen if you'd have come up there Saturday
Yeah.
They blocked the pavement, there was three cars in the drive which you cannot get!
Yeah.
They blocked the pavement and there was this bloody great lorry  up against the path so anybody coming down or up the road  had to walk into the road  or co , cross the road to the other side!
But yesterday afternoon  I mean, it was Sunday afternoon after all!
Yeah!
And she sa 
Well if it's like that now  in the winter you're not out much  in the summer when you're out in the garden 
You won't be able cos 
 
we won't be able to sit out there  and you know Claire and George?
But, I mean being in their seventies, well he's eighty now!
Is he?
Erm  they spend lots of  afternoons sat 
Mm.
out there.
Yeah.
I was bloody livid!
You know what to do?
I just got up, got out of the chair  and went.
I was absolutely furious!
And then she turned round and said well I don't hear it!
And I said, no but you have the door open


and  these doors were going on, like they're seeing this wild woman off!
Well I thought I don't but 
.
No, I say I won't leave it now, if I get much more of it then it's the environmental health!
Ah!
But she's one of those cantankerous types!
Yeah, she must be!
But er 
Thanks.
It don't bother her!
But then I say, when you  you've probably got very, very used to it!
Well that's it!
You know,an and Mick said to me 
She's must be quite lonely.
you know, I mean they were so good when they came here but I mean they've been shut in for months now!
 
Months and months!
So I mean, in the end  even animals can get cheesed off!
No I've gotta give my arm a rest.
Oh!
Oh!
Oh well, up a bit.
Hiya!
No, I say she'll er  she'll have to do something about it cos Mick said  well, he just said to me no  he said well  what can she do?
Erm  she'll have to get rid of them.
I said, she won't  to let them bloody in!
I mean that's what they say about Julia that time weren't it?
Mm.
Well when I went to Citizen's Advice tha that lady said  I don't think it's viable to have four dogs in  a semi- detached anyway!
That was a vet so
Have you got a hanger?
I've got that one 
Yeah.
that broke.
Yeah.
I haven't.
I bet my  water.
Why have you, I thought I saw one but then I thought this is staff I think.
Well who's is that one then?
Dunno, it was on the floor .
What and that fell on the floor?
Well if it was on the floor and somebody wants it they'll have to have it won't they?
It's not the one I .
Ooh!
What's that?
I didn't see the
Gone through the  now.


It's no wonder er  that's the er  dearest show  or the most expensive show they've ever done  costume-wise  really.
Very fabulous!
Beautiful!
Even in those seats we had were .
What was that actually at  Wembley?
Wembley, yeah.
Wembley.
Yeah.
Yeah.
The seats were fantastic!
That's the one I liked best, the man in the blue.
Yeah, that's the one Bev liked liked best  and the merry-go-round that's just in there  cos of the fair
Mm.
and there's the one that linked right round.
I mean that was  they  dimmed the lights so that they're not all erm  silvery grey  at one stage.
I mean, it was a job to say which one 
I was gonna say,i it's that one.
Yeah, that's the one that went over 
And then  
that was the fair.
But erm  but the whole the point about this show was  three partners had stopped near the door  the whole ice was covered with people who  and er  apart from the juggler an and you know  bits 
Yeah.
like that, but  but that isn't the woman.
That isn't the woman.
It was a blonde haired woman.
Oh!
But obviously she was the star when they .
But the actual  main star    is this one.
He was .
Lovely when they !
You know, the production?
Mm.
I'm sure they did do it well.
All that time  must of had a ball!
I thought that was   so this is , we had a bad night's sleep!
I would have said while I was putting out my washing cos I did it last night on purpose for the gas man coming in.
They're all asleep next door!
Yeah, they don't have to get up!
No!
No!
Anyway,and I have one for Connie, that's the little girl over .
Oh right!
Yeah.
Was one, there's two now.
And  so she's on medicine.
Erm  I know, like you do these  and er  I mean I, I've heard about Alan and Sue for a long time, I know they're having a lot of bother, you know with the  decorating and all that.
But she's got in there, well I hope Alan and Sue can settle now.
Apparently, a lot of the trouble they had was her father!
He says  him to go to work and look after the kid.
Well they got two kids now but the , it was then, you know?
And er  Alan apparently wants to go to Spain  and Alan said well I'm not bloody working there, as he said, I don't wanna earn money like that!
And course, they had,with us you know  at one time  and now they've got that  holiday again now, so I mean none of them would of been cheap  when they did it.
No.
And er  I didn't realise that  you know, the father had  .
said about it.
Mm.
I didn't bloody know, I  worked it out.
Well he knows he can er, start off
Without any hassle.
Oh!
Oh!
Doreen?
Oh!
Oh!
I haven't.
Beautiful it was!
Really was!
Well but we go .
Oh lovely!
Fifteen  fifteen quid seats we had.
Two.
Oh!
And we had a nice coach this time.
Oh!
Somebody called  Freeway Which is a lot of
Kingston.
Oh yeah, Kingston, yeah.
It was Kingston.
And you didn't look out the   
No.
And it was a beautiful warm  comfortable.
Last time we went up,la last year was when erm     no heating like.
Yeah.
And it was an old coach.
I mean, alright the heating didn't go wrong  but it wasn't that, the coach itself was  you know, really rattled!
Rattled all the time!
Yeah some are quite .
They've got a, I think they've one  ones.
We had one  good one when we went to Bournemouth.
They've got a double decker they use for the school run and that is absolutely on it's last legs by the look of it!
Yeah, we had a double decker one time when we went to Bournemouth but I can't remember who it was.
But that wasn't  old.
Cos that was when Helen and  Tommy  's erm  wife left their clothes on there thinking it was staying there but it never, it came back.
It was on another run, we got another coach  come back  so they had to go out to where the one it was to


pick up their clothes!
But I tell you what though that erm  ice rink place  it wasn't half full!
They fill them up!
Masses and masses amounts of people!
But that is, if you go up under your own steam I mean even dearer than the way we did it.
Mind you it's getting to the end of the run as well isn't it now?
Then it's
London.
Yeah.
Mm.
Then it's London.
Er  you know  most of those it's sort of pre-Christmas and round Christmas.
That's right.
You know, like the pantos innit?
Yeah, we certainly found it was a .
But er, it was very good!
Yeah, years ago my granddad  remember, he used to take me to a  pantomime something 
Yeah.
like that.
Well I suppose it's just 
We used to go with  
go into the Brownies and  I used to go Windsor every year actually with my two.
Yeah.
I didn't have to pick up  
That erm 
or nothing on there.
I don't know if you saw Brush Strokes?
You know the sequel to that?
Yeah.
Veronica?
Oh yeah!
She used to be  in the pantomimes at Windsor.
Oh!
Yeah her  mother and father used to be  the , but they were sort of in the  always in the scene  erm, repertory and they were in charge of you know?
That tree 
Perhaps her manager or something.
whoever was in 
She had her sister 
there, it was good!
the other sister as well.
That was  skating all around, you know  it turned.
And the eyes went up and down and then they were going up and down.
Mm!
Really !
Almost, you know  and  they said they were better , we were right looking at the stage over this time.
Last time we were over here and when it came down it  ever such a big thing!
And they just go down like  
 


Yeah!


Yeah!
Ever such a big  thing,or whatever you call it!
Yeah i it's really good!
And, Bev, all Bev said  Liquorice Allsort through all this one.
Yeah.
she's got , but I liked those.
. And of course, being so  in the back seat they sort of when they, they she 
Mm.
landed they, they  
 
they don't 
Yeah.
as though they, as though they just going off !
Well they slide don't they?
I mean you can't see their face 
Face 
or legs or anything can you?
Cos I mean the  I like the difficult  
 
with that 
Yeah.
on.
No.
No, they come on.
I didn't watch.
I used to  
 
I used to do  rollering a bit.
though my kids both ice skating.
They came down, they were altogether like that but at one point those red ones came down the ice altogether.
You weren't allowed to take photographs.
I took the camera, but I never used it.
Mm.
But people were popping off again like last year.
And he specifically said this bloke  none 
Well  
allowed  
No she didn't!
Don't take any notice if they don't want.
It just said no photographs inside and yet 
.
But it was, really was 
It's one of  things things on television  about it, you know, I mean  
Yeah, what the video?
you see them  things going and you wonder 
Ya, but yeah.
if they're told not to or whether they're allowed to.
But I suppose the only difference in this is the .
They make the bloody things with roller skates like that.
Yeah.
If it was me I'd go straight 
Yeah.
over.
Jason's obviously  down when they've, you know well  .


A bit more.
Oh I really buy a Range Rover.
That's much better.
I mean th the Around the World in Eighty Days was good.
Mm.
But this was more   
 
somewhere  it says about the am amounts that was spent on the costumes.
Must of been  loads  and they're opening, there's a new  new stadium 
Yes.
Yeah, in Switzerland..
They're at least seventeen, not over twenty  the first figure skater.
Yeah.
Erm, Switzerland.
Mm.
But somewhere it says about the amount it cost, but I mean if must be  like that.
Must be bad!
I mean, even one's like this.
Yeah.
You know?
But he was magnificent!
Tremendous that one!
. But it was, it was very good!
But it shows the difference between last year and this year.
When we went up to th , we had coffee and Mick had a  bottle of beer  erm, before we went in and  and last year, well you wouldn't of go , dreamed of getting a seat in that  restaurant area,yo you wouldn't!
Now, this year we  
 
and there was a spare table.
Yeah.
Mm.
And , the people that were milling around us when you're trying to drink a cup of coffee stood up  last year  it was just the, you know, people are not 
Was it the same time of the year?
Yes.
You didn't go earlier last year?
Well I don't think so.
I'd have to ask Mick but  I don't think so.
I mean generally they  you know, I, that's one of the things people cut back though isn't it?
Oh certainly!
Certainly, because erm  I say it's  you know, it's sort of an extra innit? something  innit?
Yeah.
You know?
And er  but you could see it.
I mean it's a huge place Doreen!
Erm, probably the ice hockey or whatever like that  they  
 
but there was a hell of a lot of !
Yes, they do, they do horse shows and that though 
Mm.

He came through, he came I mean  
Told you when it's , yeah he starts coming round .
Well that was a few .
Mm?

I haven't got a clue to be honest, you

But then it would be the same , wouldn't they?

What is it then?
I mean it's not  two pound!
So
Leave it then.

Well no, because I've gotta give it
Yeah I know, but it's no good if  you're gonna get yourself uptight about it!
Just gonna go and on though aren't you?
Well you can always say  you can't do it, you've got    divorced innit?
I I, there's no point Bev if it's gonna bother you!
I'm telling you now!
I thought you were  yesterday.
Ay?
I thought were a little bit uptight.
Well it's not that I'm uptight.
What is it then?
I think it's because  I haven't done it for so long
Yeah.
Well,cos if it's any good,.
I want it!
I don't wanna be a  failure!
Who knows!
Exactly!
And the only way I'm gonna know is if I take it.
Mm.
God it's not the right time of the bloody month!
You got a couple of letters here.
Have I?
Yeah.
Where?
Oh!
Oh one's a .
Well I should make your mind up Bev, here and now.
You really must!
If you prefer not I'll, I'll say
No!
I want it!
I know you want it Bev but it's no good getting yourself uptight!
It's no good at all!
No good at all!
Just waffle on and be done .
It's to be expected really.
Yeah, but then  fifty nine thirty two.
What?
Well that's erm  cheque erm    .
Well that's what I was waiting for weren't it?
And then I'll get my old  fixed.
Well no, you must make your mind up  love.
Real last.
 Yay or nay I mean there's only a possibili , what is the thing you don't know how to do?
Well, the word processing.
But that's not it,i 
What is it then?
I mean, it seem to me it would be an ideal one  if 
Well it would!
if, if, from what she says.
It would!
So you take the bull by the horns or you don't!
Yeah.
Or you don't.
But if yo if yo let it get you down then you don't.
It hasn't got me down.
Mhm.
Well that's what it is, apprehension's made that happen.
Yeah.
Certainly.
And you don't want that .
Well, I say, he tend to go at eleven and three, so think about it.
Yeah, you're right.
You see it's not really for me to do.
I mean, from the sound of it she's  answers the telephone, does a bit of typing and 
That girl in there though?
Mm.
Does a bit of typing.
Oh I want it!
Don't get me wrong.
So why not?
But the you gotta expect, there's bound to be a bit of apprehension.
I understand that totally.
But I think it's take the bull by the horns
Oh yeah,
and I mean let's face it  you might not like it!
You might not  you might get there and you might say  oh I don't like this!
But that can be the same anywhere couldn't it?
Yeah!
If you come up my place.
Which I'm sure you wouldn't like would you?
Ha!
Okay I'm going out now.
Well I suppose if you want to  work  then the first one is   
The first ones always can be the worst one!
Ay?
Well, the first one's always gonna be the worst one!
Mm!
Certainly is!
But I say, I'm sure your capable of taking the bull by the horns.
Oh God, yeah!
I've done it before it's just I haven't done it for so long!
Oh well!
I mean er  that's why I never done the  yesterday.
I mean, it's not that she's probably gonna go after it but  I, you know, who knows!
I mean they know up there because of the, of theirs.
But they'll probably  rather annoying at the moment.
Innit?
Yeah.
Well I think it's   If you want it.
Oh, I'll be alright now.
I shall be alright now cos of Val.
Yes, that's right.
I mean, as I say, you might get there and you might hate it anyway.
Yeah, I might not even get it bu 
No.
No, another he said was that bloke came in later.
What was that man's name?
Clive   
Clive?
Clive?
I dunno, it was either Clive or Richard I think.
I mean unless they get a temp from an agency  they gonna want somebody aren't they?
Yeah.
Sounds to me as though they're just  sell stuff, I I don't know!
But it sounds to me as though it's taking something off the telephone, which is simple innit?
Yeah.
And erm  a bit of  couple of letters typed.
I mean, the re at the least you could go and have a look I suppose if
Is it somewhere ?
He never said.
He honestly never said.
It seemed to me it were the type of place you could sit and do your knitting.
Yeah.
If she's sat watching them   she's pregnant but  if she'd have sat watching Neighbours  and she weren't able to    was she ?
And he did say to me  well he has spoken to me about it, he did say answering  the telephone.
He said that.
Mm.
As I say, I've only met her the once.
And she come up in the car for him once.
But I mean the first step is always the hardest.
I mean, if  that don't only apply to you.
No.
But er  if you want it an and it's  then  no harm in going and having a look!
Is there?
Like I say, the choice is yours hundred percent!
You don't have to.
I want it but
Well the  butt of it then has gotta be go over.
Mm.
I mean if, if she wanted you to go out there today, just if  then the sensible is to pick up a taxi.
Yeah.
Well, then I know where it is.
Certainly!
I mean I went, I'm i if it's the place where we said it is  then, I mean it  I know we went through  Thicket , yes I do!
Cos I saw their horses and which I think are Moira's.
But I mean  you know what I'm like in a car I just sit there and then then  your father turned in  and there was all these, where we went to get the carpet, you know?
And that is as much as I can  sort of remember.
But I really don't take much notice  anyway, sat in a car.
No.
I don't.
Still as I say, no,th it's, it's a fair comment to say it's to be expected.
But if you can overcome that  you know, by saying ah what the hell!
It's either this or nothing which, which it is  and if you want it  I mean Lesley's not bothered about it cos he's giving her seven hundred quid a blooming  month!
Well neither would you if yo , somebody give you seven hundred quid a month!
Neither would I!
For God's sake!
I wouldn't get up at six, put the washing out and then go up there!
Thinking .
But there again, one week you might, one month you might get a  one month he might give her that and  bugger all the next month!
Well she says it's guilt money and that is possible.
Mm.
But, I think you're quite right in what you say.
Quite right!
No doubt about that.
You never know  with what she said anyway.
Unpredictable.
But I mean, knowing her  the  the the sa , the money she's had  she will  erm  certainly look after.
Mm.
You know?
I mean she's been living off what  seventy three odd quid has she?
Yeah.
So I mean there isn't anyway in the world that she's gonna bank  seven hundred quid a month!
No way at all!
She'll er  make the most of that because she won't  possibly  money for erm
Mhm.
she'll want money for the deposit and  and  whatever she gets.
Has there been much noise today?
No, but  their dogs and that.
Got a lot done this morning then?
Well I did it on the way  .
Why not?
And stupid git there should of popped those  in there!
Really stupid!
Could of done that easily couldn't I?
Yeah.
There's plenty time weren't there?
What did they think of the brochure then?
The
Yeah!
Yeah, they did like it.
But I say, you have to be there to appreciate it don't you?
Oh yeah!
You know?
Sorry?
I say, you might as well buy the other book.
Mm mm.
We can go on Sunday.
Oh, it's going all morning.
Been going all morning.
Was she in there?
Oh she was in there.
She's very  isn't she?
Oh, well it's either that or she's just ignorant!
I can hear it now.
Wait till he's gone out now.
I think they've all gone out.
Do you?
Well the red car  innit?
Yeah but I mean I only her.
I'll try her again and this time  let it all come out.
Impress on them that you don't wanna come out with it short.
Can you?
Yeah.
Lorna or somebody.
Well we know, we know Lorna.
But it seems to me that Gwendoline and Margarite that  are scissor happy.
Don't go in there .
No I mean if the , one of the  I think the situation 
I shall alright.
will change totally and I 
Yeah.
mean  I don't know what this is.
It's just going 
I 
back  after five 
Well 
years.
yeah, not so, so confident but if you don't make the attempt
Then I shall be like this every time something crops up.
And you've done this all before under worse circumstances.
Yes.
Oh well , I really do!
But I think sometimes  I mean you've either got to do what you do  coming back from Germany  I think you have to take the bull by the horns don't you?
Oh yeah!
And I tell you, I don't know what this is.
Well I don't.
Or if it's gonna occur  but it seems to me  it would, or sounds like  it would be a simple let in  to the 
Yeah.
to the situation.
Mm..
Erm  that's only what I heard, that's all!
I don't think it's a  massive place that  you know, I I just think it's like  a warehouse thing.
A .
Yeah.
A  might be the word.
I don't know!
But it was no different from me starting work up here  that time
After so long
after so long, which it was a long time.
Course it isn't!
It ju it's just the same.
But in the end I had to do it  didn't I?
Well you have to do it.
If the circumstances are such  you have to do it.
And er  I say, that  well purely taking the bull by the horns innit?
Really?
I know.
It's for your own benefit because 
Yeah.
whatever it pays if it's, if it's better  will pay more than  obviously what you're gonna get from either or.
Then go in or
Well I shall still get his.
Yeah, I know you still get his.
But  I won't 
Well you ca 
I won't get the income.
Mm mm mm.
That's right.
But nevertheless  you know, if you could get it and you could manage it  it will relieve the bloody boredom wouldn't it?
Ya.
Cos it is boring!
Mm.
Course it's boring!
Boring for me!
Because what is it
Pardon me.
and that's where it should be nice  made a change didn't they?
Yeah.
You know?
That's where it made a difference  but I was  sticking in all the blinking week  I'll save that till he gets home but  apart from 
That's rubbish innit?
Well apart the radio  but I expect they're gonna  a radio of sorts you know?
But er  no I say, the choice is yours.
Certainly!
Well that, the first step's some when  will have to be taken
Well the longer I leave it the worse it'll get.
Certainly will!
But then, I mean a actually I mean as I said, Lesley ain't that bothered  because of what he's giving her
Mm.
but at the same time  she's got all lethargic  cos 
Yeah.
cos she won't even go out with Jenny, look!
I mean, I say, still again, I don't know whether she swims or she doesn't  but nevertheless it's an invitation out innit?
Well she can go to the spa bit.
Well any of it!
Well even if you went and watched.
Yeah!
There was 
At least you're out.
there was people watching over the balcony last week.
I saw them!
Yeah.
But I say  I believe in in one respect  alright, she's got the car  she can whip in and out  but I do believe in another respect she's got to the point where she can't be bothered!
No.
And it's so easy to sit every day innit?
too!
Anyway, so  might not get the opportunity anyway, so it might not arise.


Well the point is, for a thing like that  if somebody else knows somebody
Yeah.
and they're willing to take you on for x  you know  erm  it just, a lot of it is  word of mouth.
Word of mouth these days.
It is!
Don't mean   there's a  what's a name in there, a waistcoat.
What a
mohair I think.
Oh.
But I dunno.
That's your father.
Mm, quite nice innit?
Quite a different  feel today.
Mind, I get bored to tears with doing this every damn day!
Bored out my skull!
Right well if I ordered another, I order from the  thing.
Right.
If I ordered another four
Don't do it for Friday cos you'll be out.
Oh yeah.
Oh well stay away from Friday then.
m
What I can't understand is, it happens all the time my telephone next door 
Yeah 
and somebody must try and get in touch with her in the evening if she's not in.
They must realize she does work
But I mean we've had this for blooming weeks now ain't we?
Er nine weeks
It's either the phone or the dogs or the child
Mm  when you can hear the telephone like that in here, there's no wonder you can hear the rest of them
No
cos that telephone was in the hall 
It surprises me
Mm
leave it, leave it ringing so long
What on the other end?
Yeah
Mm, that was stupid yesterday though Mark putting that on
Mm
god dear me, who ever even thought of it look  stopped now

Yeah, dependent on, I mean that's twice since I've been home innit?
It rang about three times this morning before you got here
Obvious they're away then innit?
I don't know I mean sometimes it goes and I think she's in there don't you?
Yeah 
I wonder if all the dogs are in there?
Probably
I thought, when I went and opened the windows I saw the other one but I didn't see the 
they wouldn't have room in one car for four dogs would they?
I don't think they take the dogs out in the car for a run, you know, like a lot of people do
No
I don't think she puts them in the car
it's not the sort of car that you do that with, not with four anyway, you'd imagine them having an estate car
Mm
wouldn't you?
Yeah, something where you can put the bar up at the back
Mm
and erm Val has got one ain't she, for Just
Yeah 
Is it a telephone?
It's gotta be 
Yeah 
a telephone, what the hell's going on?
Oh I don't know
I reckon it's been brought into the front room because erm, if she shut that door for them, cos she shuts the animal in a, a room here there and bloody everywhere, it's stopped again now ain't it?
She might of answered it, she might be in there.
Oh that's twice, a hell of a lot of time but er
But they said wet and windy, but that wasn't there was it?
I think that was more up North.
Oh, up North, right.

I am now.
Not on video is it? m
Whining  farting  howling  erm  he came in at half past five and er  overnight again she's got two carloads there  so it was just the same till gone eleven  anyway when Mick came in  I said to him what did that bloke say and he said he's looking out some  different equipment to what he 
Mm
and hopefully  But I said to him about  Duttons Road  and I said to him what I'll do is, I've gotta go to town tomorrow  I'll er get some tapes  and start taping
Mm.
and write a letter for Duttons Road, enclose one of the tapes  and say where do I go from here?
I mean you know, I mean it was just impossible, I don't know what the hell's going on in there.
There's two cars in the road, two in the drive this morning.
Been there all night.
Course they're all in bed aren't they?
Yeah.
Do you know bus fares go up Sunday?
Well I haven't been using the bus Sandra.
Twenty eight now  it will be  and thirty four from the hospital.
Ooh!
Dear oh dear.
There was a notice and  it was Monday  and I said, you know, what was it?
Oh, don't really know, they tend to go up sort of two
Well sometimes they went up one.
Some while back.
Well yeah, I don't think any of them are going up one  this time.
Well we've been walking, I mean  we ain't been out this week.
So it was the chatty one this morning.
He started chatting and there was nobody else on the bus and I said to him what are they?
It's twenty eight.
I said what's the hospital ?
He said thirty four.
The Drove  should be forty seven he said but it's an odd amount.
He said  they may, cos it's forty five at the moment
Yeah.
he said they may just go one to forty six he said or they may even go forty eight on that one  to even it up.
Ah there's the continuation innit?
And he said thank goodness,h he said oh they got  and I said yeah  I've got Monday and Tuesday off he said, it might have died down when I get back he said cos us drivers take all the stick.
I suppose that's perfectly true.
Which  yeah I said well  there's nobody else, I said they get on and you say I want more money  but he said it's a nightmare.
Gotta be.
Gotta be innit?
But I mean the hospital, when you think
Yeah but people don't realize do they?
that need, you know  if you're, unless you live sort of here  you're going up for appointments, doctors, whatever 
Well that's what I mean.
and you don't feel like walking.
You get on, I mean if it's a mum and a kid or  
Oh well we've been walking when we've gone into town  but I mean  just between you and me  but when I got home Bev said   pop into town I've got a parcel to post and I said well I can't  I said because according to Des  well nothing happened
It didn't.
and she got a bit angry and I, I get a bit angry so I said, because I said well what the hell is going on?
Now
He should of kept his mouth shut.
I mean if she's gone home 
He should.
and said ooh they didn't half seem interested, I reckon they might  then he comes in and says 
Well I'm not gonna say a word to him Sandra, I'm not 
 
gonna say a word, I'm gonna wait on  and see if he says anything  and er she got 
Cos surely I mean if they'd of said  we are going to
Mm 
but they didn't 
Yeah.
Well I think it's a just a mess about place don't you?
I mean she's in and out of town all the time like you said  here there and bloody everywhere.
Perhaps they had something else in mind, perhaps it's her.
Perhaps she was thinking oh yes it's  
Well why didn't he say that yesterday then?
I mean it
Or is he twisting what she says.
Well  but yesterday, when he said that, you'd of thought
Well I did
well mind you, the only thing is he said did she get a phone call yesterday and she never  so he might have  he expected her to have had one.
Would you not think?
Yeah.
Yeah.
But she's getting cross now cos I said to her look  you've gotta think about this seriously.
You going out there, you stop all your Income Support and it co turns out to be a bloody week or something  well alright you turn round and get back on Income Support but it's not simple is it?
Is she regis she's registered with quite a few agencies hasn't she?
All of them yeah.
Yeah cos they tend to 
Well as far as I know.
phone up Thursday 
Yeah.
even Friday morning
Yeah.
when they've just had a call in, to start on Monday.
Yeah.
You know, so it's her
But I, I mean I'm 
the possibility that she could get some
Yeah.
Well I'm not very happy about this situation at all, I have to say.
Alright so he should keep his mouth shut, this I agree with  but at the same time  she leaves 
Well so somebody ain't 
tomorrow.
Yeah somebody ain't telling the truth are they?
No.
So it's up to her.
I said to her well it's up to you what you do, but I said er I, I don't like the situation.
I mean she sat watching Neighbours all that day.
He did say to me right in the very beginning basically it's answering the telephone.
And then er that
Well if that's case she can go and work for one of the taxi companies and sit in their office and ans 
That's right.
But that day that that woman phoned up  the house  erm  she said I've been watching Neighbours or something
Mm.
and she said erm one of them, I think it was  Clive, he's just narked off she said.
She did
Hello.
Hello Doreen.
Hiya Doreen.
Yeah, so  it's up to Bev what she does about it but I mean I'm bloody pissed off with it.
She does keep on, but I'm not gonna say a word to him.
She never got a phone call about that job
Ooh
Anyway I'm not saying a word to him, I'm gonna wait and see if and what he says  because I say it's making me angry.
And that's the second, third time he's said to me
Yeah.
So I'm not gonna say nothing.
Well he brought it up in the first place.
It wasn't as if 
Absolutely.
you said oh who's taking your wife's job.
I never.
Never even bloody thought about it anyway.
But I say it's in peculiar bloody works.
But I don't think it is a works, I think it's two blokes, I dunno how many are there but it  all I've heard of is these two bosses
Mm?
and her.
And I say if she sits watching Neighbours and pops in to town to book a holiday for Brittany and  well I shan't, I shan't say  
You don't normally have televisions around do you?
Well that's what  Bev said.
She said watching Neighbours?
But she told Bev .
And I said 
Well Annette said when she was up at  but 
Some do.
but they were all to do with sort of satellite dishes and it was in their reception area and it had satellite T V on, and it was an advertising thing as much 
Mm.
as anything, if she ever had to do reception
Mm.
she couldn't understand how, she said oh she said and, and a couple of channels that used to drive her up the wall.
Oh them things was on  
Ooh er  stupid person!
God!
Well that must have been a big bit surely.
Seems nobody was underneath it.
Well  bit late anyway weren't it?
Yeah well I say
shut up now.
Mm I see that.
 

Body Shop was on there  erm
Saw it.
this morning, no just now
Oh.
I don't know whether they're having difficulties, I don't know what it was about but he seemed very serious, this man.
It was all about money
Mm.
but
It wasn't their profits was it?
Cos they're all
I dunno.
issuing their
Yeah.
yearly reports aren't they?
Yeah.
Yeah well the banks are all  
 
Barclays only made only made five hundred and thirty three million.
Well that's nothing to them is it?
I mean dunnit , it makes you laugh does it?
Yeah well it's nothing to them.
million down innit?
Yeah.
This is it.
Cor yeah but  it's still a profit not a 
But erm 
loss innit?
Morning.
Yeah but they don't 
How much ?
Oh I didn't, I didn't know.
Er
they said anyway, and then the parishes add their bit.
Cos it's in the erm  
Oh I didn't know 
Was it?
Mm.
Forty pound extra.
Oh I didn't know, I didn't see.
How much, forty pound?
Forty pound wasn't it?
Mine's sixty pound actually.
Yours is?
Yeah cos we had a discount last year  
Oh you did didn't you?
Yeah we had a twenty pound discount so we've got a hundred 
Yeah that's right.
and twenty to find this year.
Oh.
I know I did seen it on the T V, different places, but I, I didn't know anything about here.
My  yesterday and said that  well my cousin said they've gotta pay twenty pounds  but my friend said there is a  those who couldn't pay    I dunno whether it'll do any good but  I should think some of them 
Well 
wouldn't want their neighbours to know.
well in the end I expect there'll be a lot of places that do it don't you?
I mean it's er  true, isn't it?
Mm
It's true  so  well   one here.
If you get caught 
Jolly good job 
Well yeah.
 
Did you see in, I don't know wha where it was   free paper 
must be something they can do.
the other day but  yeah it must have been cos I haven't seen any papers since Monday  how many thousands don't pay on  not paying their television licence.
Oh yeah.
They've got  
Oh really?
thing now, it's .
Yeah they got, they can do it better now and 
Well there you go, it's just another fraud 
Fine them more and all.
They're bringing fraud, I did see that on the T V, they're bringing fraud into
It's  innit?
Yeah.
They're bringing it in or something or thinking of bringing actions forward into the  or  whatever.
Saw that this morning, something about it anyway.
But er 
Oh   the first payments are due .
But we started late last year didn't we?
Thought we started in June, but I got one more to pay.
So I got  I got Friday  to pay and that's ten months.
I of that and I said to to him is that the last one?
He said well I ain't heard nothing but  
Well it is for me.
Definitely.
I've got one more 
That's February's payment.
That'll be February's payment yeah    No 
the month so you'll have to  
No 
March.
It would be March because we started late didn't we?
Do you remember?
Cos normally normally you finish in February 
Yeah well normally I would of been finished wouldn't I?
and we used to have March
I pay it at the end of the previous month so it's due on the  twenty eighth, twenty ninth 
We used to start paying the rates in May.
Yeah we did  but I had a feeling  we were late  last year 
So I should think that's  but I reckon we must  cos the government changed it, it knocked hundred and forty quid off didn't they?
Yeah.
No I, I, but I'm sure I've got one more to pay but it'll be the fifteenth of March that'll be due.
Mm.
Cos I do it, the day he gets paid I pay all the bills
Yeah.
and that'll be for the next month  
But I said to  I said well you might get a free month but I said or you   in March and then Ap supposedly April starts again.
Well that depends when they start again dunnit?
Unless they do it, less the banker's orders go  start 
Yeah.
in May.
Don't know Sandra.
But I'm 
It was just a bit in The Echo cos they're all about here and 
sure I've got one more to pay.
Eastleigh is quite high again.
That's nearly three hundred.
So's Welwyn innit?
Welwyn's over three hundred.
Yeah.
I saw that on the  well proposed  
Yeah.
Cos Annette paid a lot when she was then at Chandler's Ford  
Yeah 
very high one.
Ah.
Thanks Gloria.
Mind you Marguerite's was over the three hundred last year when she  
And where was that?
Er  it's funny up round there cos there's about three different councils well although her address is Hampshire
Yeah
the postcode  is Guildford  and you've got Aldershot or there's  and there's another one that is  three different cou another one 
Mm.
But it was one, one of them anyway and hers was over three hundred so  save a bit.
Mm.
But once again they haven't worked hers out, I mean she told them she was down here in January  and she still hasn't had a bill yet for the end of this year.
Well all you can do is tell them, I mean you're within the law then, it's up to them innit?
You know?
twenty one days don't you, when you move to no she notified the one she'd left.
She said I'm not paying any more up there, I'm moving  
 
and notified  
I mean they all ought to be geared up for all this for Christ's sake.
Mm.
It must be happening every day of the damned week.
Yeah.
They take so long to sort it.
But I mean it's like Hugh, they said he hadn't registered or something wasn't it?
That's what they said.
But ,said to me one day  erm 
Yeah but he wasn't paying it before was he?
He hadn't registered, that's what I was told.
Yeah.
So when the bit of paper came  they just ignore it  
They said he 
Well  
you, you haven't paid when he was out at  cos you have to notify them that you're moving
Mm
so one council's got a bit of paper and it ties up with the other one when you come here  but if you don't, if you haven't paid before you couldn't tell them you were leaving 
 
or if he suddenly says here  I'm here
Mm.
well then the next question is where have you come from?
Mm that's, that's right yeah.
Yeah but he hadn't registered, that's what  cos I said to  well I don't really know this sort of thing I said,said here, that's first I knew.
I said now there's three more of us that know that he's not paying poll tax
Mm.
then she said yeah he told me all about it, she said he hadn't registered.
And I said well if, if you're gonna do this sort of thing you keep your bloody gob shut.
Don't you?
Mm.
Cos there's all of us that know now, she knows.
Good job he didn't tell me.
Not that I could do anything but I wouldn't  
But he didn't register 
 
When they move into that new house though, cos I mean the council are aware that the new  
Yeah.
Well you would think so Sandra
and services to be connected  
but I mean when you have a erm
You know the builders might even say we've sold these two.
when they don't have erm, when you have your election form and that and you send it in,do don't they come round if you haven't sent it back, or do they just, they used to didn't they?
No.
They don't check up.
Well I, I know something I erm, what was it then, what ?
Perhaps it was the erm 
sign those papers because they thought there was a tie-up
perhaps it was when we had the census paper 
Loads of people 
then was it?
Census paper had to be 
Oh 
done, yeah.
Cos they came round then.
Why can't, if they don't get things back, why don't they come round?
They can't cos I don't think there's enough  
 
in this country.
What I said, if it was like 
enough people 
No!
If it was like Germany where everything is, is regimented, whatever word you wanna use  whether you agree with this or whether you don't, everybody in Germany pays everything that they should.
Mm.
Now, if you agree
Well I suppose that is it, you see in this they don't believe in  believe more in freedom don't they?
Oh yeah 
Hiya!
They've blocked the idea of I D cards haven't they cos 
Mm.
Yeah.
Well you see 
Like we had in the war, we had an
Yeah.
identity card.
But you see you can say it's the big brother and all this rubbish, but the fact remains that we three are paying the poll tax and he is not.
Mm.
This is it.
This is how it ends up .
I mean everything is, is  well, regimented, I can't think of a better word  
Germany they do it with T V licences 
 
Yeah
when he went in to hire  or buy a television, they 
Yes they do.
Yeah.
had to notify the authorities that so and so has signed up for one.
So perhaps the house 
Mm.
Well I don't know but, but if they  up there 
  
and bought a house  well then the next question is well where have you come from?
Well of course and this is  don't you feel whether it's  
So I mean  
Yeah!
So you and I and Doreen 
let everybody come here don't we?
I mean to say   law in other countries but they're always pleased to come here and take all our what's it aren't they?
This is it!immigration  to stop.
I mean all the Scottish and the Welsh,I always remember when  when erm  when the first houses, when we lived, when I lived with me mother, and in that house we lived in was a big estate  erm near us and erm  ever such a lot of Welsh people lived there  and, I don't know who it was, somebody wanted a place, couldn't get anywhere  and my mother went up there with     you let all the Welsh people come here he s she said they run us down  and that was years and years ago she said, nearly everybody on that estate's Welsh  ourselves.
with Dennis and Marge we'd been out with Dennis and Marge you know, a while back, and they're both Scottish and they run this country down to the
I know.
and he's, he's  working in there!
 
up until now, but, well  are different now  this is the last place he stopped, he would walk down the road if he heard of a job for five pound more
Mm.
and
And he always seemed to slip into it I expect.
He did.
Now he's staying here 
They do don't they, Scottish people?
because of the state of the country, or the state of the employment, but we've been out, actually out with those two and they  put this country down  
 
yet they never stayed up in Scotland cos there was nothing to bloody do.
Now they own their coun well they're buying their council house  he works for where  was you know, and she's erm  something director, financial director now.
You see?
I mean   but I mean people are still flooding into this country today.
Mm.
That's what I say, there'll always be, they run us down like mad and    and yet they all come here.
same as all these black countries  didn't want us in there did they?
But  lot of them wanna come over here now things are getting bad for them.
Well no, that was another thing  more or less as I was coming out the door they'd got the news thing on  and this was Australia  the new prime minister, I don't know his name, he's running down  I didn't hear it properly but I heard the gist of it, erm and it
yeah it was running us down this morning cos Britain something something something.
Mm.
Mm.
The insults to the queen, I mean she grimaced when they said it and she had to 
I saw it in the papers.
just sit there and she's not allowed to answer back.
She's, no cos erm he  in a speech didn't he?
Then he put his arm round her and his wife won't curtsy , she's Dutch, the Dutch  are just as bad as anybody now , just lately, I mean lot of these terrorists get in through Holland don't they?
They don't seem to do nothing to him.
Yeah.
in The Sun and there he was was saying you know, no we  virtually we don't want anything to do with the queen and all that   
I don't know why they don't write  push off!
Something on the news this morning about, about this 
And then don't  
this  prime minister   something wrong with this, English   
 
they wanna separate from us.
And they're, I mean they're not all good at the environment because what's his name David Bellamy was out there when  because they were gonna do something weren't they?
He was protesting  
Oh yeah 
Something on the erm reef or something wasn't it?
Something to do with David Bellamy
Yeah.
or something.
You don't  cos  you don't get all these things but Christine has the  New Scientist every week  and I don't know why it's always us, but you wanna read that sometimes, I don't read a lot  cos I don't understand it  but some of the things that some of the countries are doing and yet it's always us.
I mean there's a, there was a programme on  I watched last night,on the sea or ?
It runs past Germany, Denmark and Holland  and then into sort of North Sea and the Rhine comes in it and it's terribly 
Zeider Zee 
polluted.
Yeah.
I said to Leslie it's only us, and yet it's Germany does that bit, Holland does this bit and Denmark is doing something else.
There was a programme, there was  I mean a lot of it was East Germany but there was a programme on 
 
West Germany  that was a while back now  and the rivers were  in filth
Oh.
And yet it's only us.
Yeah.
Only us.
Yeah.
I don't know   
I mean when they find a bit here there's all hell let loose isn't there?
I mean even down 
Well that's right.
they had that central heating oil  and there was a big boom built all round  to stop it spreading.
And I went through there, when did I go down with you and I went past ?
 
and outside where those students sit, I thought the young people were  when you read some of that in paper  the cigarette ends and crisp packets, well that can only be the students, I mean people go through  but they're not  
Well they sit, they sit on the steps don't they?
They sit on the steps  
terrible that, I thought ooh
Well mind you Andover is, I thought  
For two pins  I'd sort of say to them, I thought well you might  might say something to the erm 
 
to the wrong sort but I thought  
Well I feel really so I wouldn't  that job.
I mean the other morning I looked down and somebody had thrown up in the street
I know, it's horrible.
all across the pavement and I thought 
Sometimes we go down the Salisbury Road   
That's the  you know by the time sort of office workers are going in, they've done all the streets and all the pavements but  while they're doing it it's a hell of a mess.
Well I shan't go,said this morning do you wanna go to town today but I said well I've gotta go tomorrow  
Mm.
erm but I said we really hung around all day yesterday with that .
I'd like to stuff it, I, I would!
I'd say stuff it.
I know she wants to get out of the house, I know 
Mm 
she wants to do something 
she wants to get some money  
but I'm not so sure about this  
 
I'm not so sure about it.
Ask her what  it is.
No I don't know anything.
I, I just think  er er I've got a feeling 
 
one day when I said something he come up with a name but it didn't register  
Where was this?
It's up where I got my carpet, up erm 
 
commercial centre,
Oh 
I mean if she


if she buses she got a half hour walk there
So it's gotta be  ain't she?
Yeah.
I mean if it, if it  I mean originally he said to me it was part time  so I thought to myself well that'll be perfect, just get her back into the flow again.
Yeah.
Then this woman says erm nine  nine till five thirty I think she said  well the five thirty bit would be alright wouldn't it 
Mm.
The nine, well  you go down into  and you get a bus  go  wherever it dropped you and then half a mile, mind you that's gonna cost you about fifty P
What?
Mm.
just to get  
Really?
Mm.
That's right,yeah.
It must do if it's gonna be forty eight to The Drove, yeah.
Mm.
Cos they go up on Saturday.
Yeah it's erm  forty to .
If I went down 
What now?
if I went up and down it would cost me eighty pence.
Well it's going up two P on Monday.
actually it was erm I forget what it was when me mother-in-law died and she used to moan about the shop and I said to  Christine the time she goes down and back  I mean things are dear in, but some of the things in the shop now, and then, are cheaper than down the town, so if you take your, your bus
Yeah
now if I was to go there and back  that's eighty pence, I mean I could get, for, for that e extra eighty pence I could get a few things in there that are dearer but I mean I like going down the town anyway and just wander and go back but I do get a few more bits in there now than I did.
Well mine's going up to twenty eight  
 
I mean it is a few years back but I can remember not long ago it was eighteen P   
 
I pay twenty six now.
And I said to him what's it going up?
Thinking will it be a penny or twopence and he said twenty eight.
  
Thirty four to .
My friend sent me erm some erm 
Been on the bus for two years.
dolls clothes' patterns as well yesterday and  they weren't half old cos on one of them there was a, a doll that you could send the doll for , there was a lot of those in Women's Weekly weren't there?
Oh yeah.
And the doll was twenty two and nine.
And it was about this, it looked this big this doll    and three and three for the postage and packing.
I thought now  oh now you'd have about two pound for postage and packing wouldn't you, and I don't know what the doll would cost.
 
cos some of them are three ply and I thought  I'm not gonna sit and knit three ply.
again for them and erm I got a phone call again from Pauline yesterday and now  wants  a wine making book and it's 
Mm 
by that bloke Berry from Andover
Oh yeah we've got one of them.
and er


I said we've been to his house, Mick and me  long time ago  when he lived  way and erm  I said to Mick well have I gotta send this?
And he said well no I don't think so, he said, er too late this year for it.
Take it.
Take it with us.  more postage.
What is it cheaper cos I say it's never too late actually for wine making cos it depends what you can   
Well it's their grapes  cos they've done it you see.
Yeah.
four  and Andrew's round there now.
Well
Yeah but she put that what's it  
miracle innit?
That what?
That  clocking in clock two 
I know.
two minutes slow, I mean they go by that.
He wouldn't bother about  
Yeah but when it's the other one that's slow they go by the other one.
Oh dear, well he shouldn't leave two there then should he?
They go by the slowest clock.
innit?
Mm?
Yeah but that's the one they start by, you know he, he starts  
 
when he feels like it.
He won't do nothing like that.
Well I suppose they could start at seven thirty  
Well no  
by the clocking in clock.
Eh?
Go out by the clocking in clock.
Yeah that's it.
When I, when you were all doing nights  
Everybody else does.
when Mikie was here and you were doing nights, and he called us one day and I said it's not six o'clock yet he said you're 
Two minutes to I was told 
It was two minutes to six that we  
Yeah 
That's it.
that's what I was told when I come here.
Don't let her Steve
I'm leaving   
Steve, don't let her.
Bye bye then.
Okay.
Ta ta then.
not going down the town today ?
Me?
Yeah.
Depends how I feel when I get home.
Mm.
If I feel brassed off I bloody well will.
Well it seems stupid Thursday and Friday, that's all.
I mean another thing is 
oh there, yeah I dunno what that is.
Oh is it?
It's quite nice when it's out
Oh.
but I mean it's a pain 
Oh it is a weed though innit?
Oh it's n well
Half and half.
I suppose really.
What, like a rockery?
It's an old cottage type really.
Oh.
Bye.
See you.
Cheerio.
Oh I don't know  a weed I did.
Oh I bet  bloody phone .
He never said a word.
Not a word.
said to me has he, has she heard anything and I said no and I told her what she said.
She said well you don't wanna take no notice of him.
I reckon what it is  talked about it 


what a good idea or something  
He is a liar.
Mind you she phoned her once look.
Yeah.
She was supposed to phone her back Tuesday, that's what his wife said.
Yeah.
It could well be that  have got other ideas.
Well I said
I mean they don't have to tell you everything  
No 
work somewhere do they?
I said to Bev erm  don't mean to say, I mean I might get home and find she's got a phone call  but she said to me yes I mean we, she did think of going out yesterday, and it was me that stopped it but if I feel so inclined today we'll go down  if she's in
Yeah.
cos I haven't been for about a month, three weeks.
Just for the afternoon.
No he's got funny attitude 
He's horrible really you know.
I mean there are occasions when you 
Don't you find it so terribly annoying that he's walking round  not paying his poll tax?
Mm.
Don't you?
Well I do Sandra.
I mean Doreen said  erm I wouldn't do nothing about it but  well when we found out she said I will, I'll report him but  you know when you know
Well I mean what  all you can do really is anonymously   is phone up 
Hello.
Oh here she is.
Alright?
Hiya.
Yeah.
Having a walkies today, well why not.
Why not?
A nice day.
Tis nice innit?
I say if you want we'll phone Leslie
Yeah.
I said to Sandra, well this  job business Bev, he's not said a bloody word to me this morning  he's, in actual fact  he's been 
well yeah, he hasn't been able to 
He hasn't been talking to anybody has he?
no, but he hasn't been able to because he has to come round   but he's all ra ra ra ra, whistle whistle whistle.
Well let's face it, she said she'd phone me Tuesday 
Tuesday mm.
But it's 
Now it's Thursday today
but there's there's something I didn't tell you the other day
Oh yeah
and I did say to you that you must go, if you go there you must go on the books because you're with a solicitor
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
Well I, what I didn't tell you was  I don't know if I told Sandra did I?
No I didn't
can't remember it.
No well   
They wanted me to go on casual.
Yeah.
You can't be casual any more it's against the law.
Well  well well
even bar work  but it's 
well 
it's against the law now.
he said to me one day, and I don't remember the day  he said the best thing would be for her to go on casual, then she can keep her thingy thingy.
Well I never said 
Oh yeah, I'm sure!
yeah, well I never 
So you can do the same as him and you can also not register for poll tax.
Well she's registered already.
I'm registered already.
And I mean if she got this job she'd have to pay the full amount, if she's on Income Support you don't do you?
No.
I only pay twenty percent when 
But that's beside the point.
Yeah well  
But I'd rather pay the lot  I tell you .
Well no, that's very fair comment Bev but I think this is a dodgy do.
I find this 
It sounds it.
I find this strange.
Anyway what he said to me was
I reckon they're gonna carry on paying her, keep her on the books  
Yeah.
Yeah, no they're not, they're giving her a lump sum 
You see with maternity they have to do it anyway.
Yeah but they're giving her it all in one lump sum, that's the deposit on their place.
He told me that.
But this other bit that I was telling you
Mm?
he phoned her that mor it was that morning, I know it was now, and anyway he went off and he phoned her and he came back and he said to me  yes she'll, give us your phone number didn't he?
Yeah
And she said, he said she said yes that's cheaper for us.
Cos they won't be paying any
Nothing.
thingy doodles, I, I said I don't think you ought to touch it.
Well  I couldn't do that anyway, I'd have to say
Well that's what I said to you 
if you take me on then it's gotta go on
I told you that didn't I?
But I didn't tell you all that was said cos I thought well I'm not gonna say it if there's no need  because you would automatically go there 
I ain't do nothing against the law.
Well I think it's gonna be difficult anyway Bev.
And the bus fares will be
Well it'd be very expensive in the long run.
I don't  well,probably like some of the others  cos they get a bus in on market day, they get a bus home
Well she said it, you have to catch the Woolworth one, the one for Woolworth and then walk half a mile.
I, I don't, I  I'm bothered 
 
I know.
I'm bothered about it though.
Well Sandra
and that's years back now.
That was one po no that was seventy five  each way but they go up through  and it's now gonna be twenty eight to Manor Road
Oh
just before the hospital
the hospital?
and  depending on whether they can't have an odd or even amount  forty eight to the Drove which is as far as, if you work at , that's as far as you can get in the morning and get off and walk through.
Yeah.
But I'm, I'm bothered by all this.
I know he's a liar, I know he can be a liar, but I'm still bothered by it, I mean
Well 
it's Thursday and she was supposed to phone you Tuesday but he still keeps  
If she phones then it'll it, it will be  I wouldn't take it unless it's on my terms.
I think it, you know
It would have to go through the books
Well it would.
because no way 
Well somebody sooner or later's gonna catch up, I can't understand really why these people think oh I'll get away with it.
I don't know why they bother.
I don't know why they  
Well it's like 
Cos they don't half hammer you and if they catch up with you once they watch you like a hawk.
Yeah but this is the one that ain't paying his poll tax look Bev.
Yeah.
Ain't registered.
Well you've bloody registered and you've only been back a month haven't you?
Month and a bit yeah.
Month and a bit.
No I don't like this, I don't er  it sticks in your mind don't it?
Well it would be on my terms, there's no way I'd go  cos I know it's against the law 
Well Sue said that to me up here didn't she?
Yeah and they  
They can't do it.
and it was too much hassle to put her into any other job.
Yes it was.
But I mean
National Insurance 
Mm.
Oh that's something I was 
Cos quite how they work it out  I know before 
Well 
you had to notify all your employ everybody knew
Yeah.
and between them they decided
Yeah.
Right  now 
twenty five percent cash 
I've just remembered this, her saying about Annette, you know when Sue came up and said about erm  being stunk out by the exhaust on that 
Yeah 
bloody lorry  
Mhm.
right  then we got on to talking about him going into the gents and what he does, he don't shut the door and such
Mm.
right?
And I said yeah, I was on one and Suzie was on seven, and I said yeah, even the cleaners complain, you know, in the evening that he don't shut the door when he goes to the loo  and er I said, must have said, when she's working and Dee Dee turned round and she gl she laughed and said working?
I said well whatever you wanna call it.
And then er I said well th this place was never like this when old  was here and, and Dee said no it damned well wasn't.
And I looked at Sue and I said you know  she's got twenty jobs   erm two cleaning  and
Childminding.
childminding.
And I said how, I , how does he get on ?
She said oh that's up to her, that's nothing to do with us.
So if he does declare them
Well if she's childminding, she can say she's self employed.
She's self employed there.
Therefore  
Was it there when you left for work this morning?
There were there were four there this morning when I went to work.
Sue's been there all bloody day.
I think their kid's got a bloody new organ
he's going dong dong dong boing 
Good.
Well let's hope your father brings that thing home tonight.
If not I'll go and buy one tomorrow.
I'll go and buy something.
I got up  about quarter to nine
Yeah?
and I heard it all before I got out of bed.
This bloody organ 
Something should be done .
Well I was gonna send a tape look.
If he brings, I won't   and
I think I
how do I stand
no well I was gonna do that 
 
write a letter,, send a tape to say here's an example of how we're living, and leave it up to them then.
Yeah but what's the point?
What's the point?
If I can  
Because you might they might say before you can do anything you've gotta give them this fourteen days notice.
Well then they'll tell me won't they?
But at least it'll be on the cards won't it?
I'd sooner tape because I mean that was quite impressive that tape with all that static wasn't it?
Yeah.
 
seen me I was running from one room to the other.
It was terrible downstairs wasn't it?
But she was laying in bed listening to them last night weren't you?
Yeah I don't know what they was playing at.
God knows what they get up to in there.
It sounded like the mach er like erm a motorbike, so whether they've got video games
She was laying in bed.
And we  
So whether they've got video games.
were awful.
Well we erm  we didn't go to bed till  did we?
About quarter to eleven we got to bed, but they were going on  I fell asleep during the middle of it cos I just got used  to the noise 


Yeah
See you tomorrow
Yeah 
See you.
Right I'll get us some fags, we'll have a couple of cakes.
Well I don't see the point, I mean we're staying in every bloody daft day aren't we?
You know?
And I really think
Eh?
I said I can't see it coming off.
I think it's bloody
I must be honest.
peculiar innit?
Who wants to do that travelling every day anyway?
Well  this is what she said ju just now, yeah well not just now, earlier on, she said about getting out there and I said well I'm sure it's that place  she said well it's the only one out there that she could think of.
Do you want one of these?
And er I said to her well  and er she said that she was embarrassed, I think he's about the
Yeah

Yeah.
I like those walks in this, in this weather.
No they was all on about theirs this morning erm poll tax  cos it's
Well there's no way I  against the
Well Sandra started off saying it's two hundred and seventeen pound each  poll tax  plus there's gonna be more on top because of the parish or something, but the actual borough rate is two hundred and seventeen and er then whatever it comes out at
Mm.
forty pound off something  and er course then Doreen gets on to the subject of Des again and all these people that don't pay  cos apparently somewhere, and I  she said Portsmouth but I'm not  I can't really remember  what she said
Oh hello.
they're gonna put a list up of non payers but you can't put a lit up of people like him because he's not registered.
He's not registered anywhere.
No.
Because it's like  one of the girls  now their place is close to two areas
Yeah.
because they were paying it over here until we had to pay 
Yeah
so she said 
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
because they were paying for her house, she wasn't  her husband and herself didn't have to pay over there 
No.
Hiya
Hiya.
because when her  their house  and it was being paid through there
Better off then are they?
Oh I don't bloody know
Well it's alright, we'll get something sorted.
And erm  then it was, she said we had to   so I don't know what happens when
At the what?
Who said, who told them ?
Well they're actually paying for it on the erm 
On the books?
books.
This is the council.
They wrote back and said  you have proof but you don't have receipts and
No I know
er
Yeah.
Cos she said well  
Yeah.

Who??

Oh.
There's a letter for Howard.
For Howard?

What?
Oh look look.
Well if I  erm 
Could take it down Leslie's and tell her or 
What?

Oh we'll see.
I'll take that, I'll readdress that letter  and 
Mm.
and that can go in the  box can't it?
Yeah.
Normally, I say, I don't see the point of staying in for this.
No.
I know we've gotta go out tomorrow but then if we don't go down there today we're not gonna go this week.
No.
But she  she was pleased to hear
give you a hand with this.
Yeah.
It's dirty, it runs out black.
That's a new, brand new tap that is.
Brand new tap.
I don't know who you do that 
Well let's take the whole lot out.
Well give me the bowl and I'll put it in the bath.
That'll be a job for Tim won't it?
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
I just hope that that boy
I'm sure he will.
I mean he

But 
And  can hear the crackle and the bloody 
Yeah you can
cos the ba er the crackle is very bad.
These two?
Yeah, that's all we've got left.


Yeah well I mean with all this noise and that you don't feel like doing much do you?
No.
Anyway I talked to Ann about this this morning and we've come to the decision to leave it on  because that's what we did in the  in the erm 
We knew you would.
in the ha in the what's name there and it might be a better idea because it's not .
So if we start pulling them about which is  cos I said to her about the hall and if I don't scrub it all off  we're gonna have to  erm  gonna have to do the hall and er I said we've got to try to put it on because the walls are so  ooh  bitty  you know what I mean?
Yeah.
And er I really feel that, you know, you can make yourself more bloody trouble  cos that's what happened to Helen  next door.
When she got the erm  paper off in the erm er er in the hall, she found it all fell apart.
All the walls fell apart.
It's like living back in the flat.
I've done this before, but I mean Tim will have to have a look at it when he
Yeah.
if it, if we can't, oh it's the dustman 
Have we 
dustman innit?
Yeah.
Have we got a bucket?
I've got a bucket yeah, why?
Well it's easier with a bucket.
Oh.
Oh a kettle should do, after that lot.
If we can get that lot sorted
Mm.
and then you can use the kettle can't you?
Yes.
Oh   finished that sleeve off but I must sew it on.
Yeah?
Yeah.
?
Yeah.
Right I'll leave that there.
No I'm afraid this Des is 
Well I'm not bothered.
a very peculiar character, I just find it all so peculiar.
And I mean Dee said to me this morning  cos she heard us one morning
Yeah.
well Des, she heard Des look  talking about it  and er  she said has she heard anything and I said no, I said not fully but more or less  we stayed in yesterday  cos you said shall we go out didn't you?
Yeah.
And I said more or less we stayed in but not a word.
And I say there was some sort of a  an embarrassment I can only call it
Yeah.
today.
All this whistling and 
It was all nervous.
nervous, yeah.
Bit of singing and  and that sort of thing.
Well they wanna, don't matter to me at all I just think they're dodgy characters.
And you know they don't pay the poll tax and you  you've been told almost you can do it on  casual.
You got to think about it ain't you?
Mm.
Well I wouldn't do it on cas 
Eh?
I said I wouldn't do it on casual.
Well you wouldn't do it, no.
Too much bloody worry, I mean we've never done anything like that anyway.
I say it's like him  him not paying his poll tax.
If he's gonna do things like that he wants to keep his gob shut doesn't he?
Yeah.
You know?
I just  can't understand.
But mind you he can't keep his gob shut, so I do understand  you know that er
Yeah.
that is the way he is.
He's full of gut really.
But anyway if they did phone now I think it's very bad practice  if she's leaving tomorrow
Yeah
cos Sandra said why the hell has she left so late?
You know I mean it must be three weeks now till she has it.
She said you don't normally do that.
Well she could have it any day now.
Well that's what she said, fortnight either way actually.
Just exactly what Sandra said.
So she been in next door has she, all, the whole morning?
Yeah.
Yeah well of course only just gone from last bloody night haven't they?
I mean she seems to fill the bloody house with people every day of the week.
Certainly some strange goings on in there I reckon.
Yeah well you see some people can't help that.
Some people what?
Can't help that.
Help what?
But have people round.
Yeah but it's such a strange bloody house innit?
Don't know what's going on in there do you?
Well I would have liked to have known what the noise was last night, I'm sure it was a video game or something.
If it picked up, if he finds what I think he could probably find us  I mean he knows precisely what we want and  
He wants an amplifier.
Yes but as I said before  he now has heard it so 
Yeah.
he knows what we want to eliminate.
Oh he'll come up trumps for us.
I'm sure he will.
What about the animals this morning then?
Oh not bad.
Well probably cos somebody'd been with them.
Innit?
Well if they're not left continually on their own they've got a bit of company haven't they?
Mm.
That's the point.
But when they're left totally on their own for hours and hours.
Well   make the veg   if I do that.
Woman and the man went up the garden
The woman what?
Woman and the man  and the kid
Yeah?
the alsatian and one other bloody 
Went up the garden?
What were they doing then?
Talk.
Got a chicken and a bloody rabbit up there.
Well there was.
Whether there still is, I mean  I used to hear the chicken making a ruddy noise.
I mean obviously you won't hear the rabbit but  I don't think I'm gonna stay in  anyway.
Alright so we'll be out two days  there's 
No but you're staying with me.
nothing to do.
I mean we even get bored with the knitting.
 

Eh?
You can very easily get bored with knitting.
Mm.
What's the ?
Oh   But I mean I get to work I'm so bloody tired.
I'll get those earplugs out  for night times if it's necessary.
Mm.
 

There you are.
What?
Yeah.
No we can shove that in the box.
Yeah.
Don't know what it is, don't need to open it do we?
I know he's, he's up there this weekend.
Well you do know
What?
he'd probably be very pleased to see  well all three of us if we wanted to.
Oh they brought that back in.
Yeah, I didn't think they were going.
All three of us if we went up for a weekend.
He's gotta work Bev, he's not doing enough.
He's not doing enough, he had one bad result another 
Oh, I didn't know that.
No you didn't did you?
Couple of decent ones and one bad one.
And his average is sixty two percent.
Sunday but I mean  I'm not sure, I'll say it now, I'm not sure  I'm certainly not sure he's doing enough.
If you think about it  if you think about it I've probably 
Yeah
where he is up and down, up and down and people are in and out and
Yeah.
well I'm sorry but from where I'm looking at it   sixty two  but  not that I've thought about it in any depth but  
Mm
But there again  and that have lived in town before 
Oh yeah.
so maybe not.
Probably touting for business, that's all it is.
Barclays have lost a load of money.
Yeah.
Right I can start
Yeah.
if you want.
It's in the freezer, there's a packet  
Well I'll I'll do er  carrots and that first.
And I say if you do the spuds just well, if they start to go brown inside chuck them.
Right.
Cos it goes right the way through.
There's a lot of  out to the hospital though innit?
Yeah.
Well I think we'll have to find somewhere to lock it, well Danny says there's places all over.
Well there will be.
Yeah.
Could get a, quite a  a good deal I would have thought  somewhere.
use this  tomato and onion?
Well why not?
Yeah that's a good idea.
With minced beef, I won't put carrots in cos that 
No.
might not be
Well see what they say.
Is there anything in here I've gotta get out?
Well the things will be in there
things 
Yeah one  So I won't do carrots
No.
But you need some more onion
Yeah I'll do an onion.
the potato will be on the top anyway so  that won't matter will it?
Well it says serve with  fresh mince vegetable, mixed vegetables.
Cos what you do is you put your meat in that, you don't put your
No
potato in it  do potato on the side
Oh well we can do that then.
That'll be simpler anyway won't it?
Yeah
It'll be a pot of potatoes but  I should put some onion in there though.
Oh yeah.
Cos he'll want that.
And your meat
And your meat yeah.
So 
Well that'll be a bit simpler won't it?
Could that be done in a pot?
Yeah, well it's for casserole so 
Well a pot will be simpler for when we get back if she's in of course but 
No I can't see why not.
Mind you get your tea.
Yeah.
I think we need a breather anyway.
Well it's just a waste of a lovely day.
Yeah.
It's beautiful innit?
Well no, the reason I   and because these things just go so quickly
Well yeah
that maybe it would work out cheaper to start all over again.
Well they  I would think up there there's a screw 
Screw yeah.
Well 
Will you have the new fashion taps or do you want  different bits here?
This but this is twenty five pounds worth there.
Yes I know.
I mean it was only months ago cos it's only a while ago that Tim came.
I saw that  down there again.
Do you want some more onion than that, yes?
I should chuck another one in, what difference does it make?
Oh my eyes!
Yeah  that is it.
I mean there is a lot of wall space here that is not wall look.
Yeah.
but I can't see the point of doing vinyl on that anyway  I really cannot.
Here I'll tell you what    oh yeah no, alright if you have that
Mm?
I can have er Emma Freud explores the unspoilt i island of Belize.

And what sort of wood would that have to be?
Well you can please yourself, it could be that or pine or whatever can't it?

Is it very hard?
No I should say with a er you know, I mean you've gotta  er  i if it's tongue and groove or, or whatever  but as I say, tongue and groove is best.
And that's this stuff here?
Yeah.
Quite an idea innit?
Be worth the money in the end wouldn't it?
Mm.
And then would you varnish that?
Well that would depend on what you had see

nip down and get a loaf yeah 
That , that must the last bread
Ah?
Well what do you want?

So is it, funny how they're older, they're old enough  well Lee's not
no
 

When I've had this tea I'll go down and get a cut one
Eh?
When I've had this tea, I'll go down and get a cut
won't be worth buying anything else down there anyway, cos it will be
won't it?
be interesting anyway 
Probably have a few

well sort out later, sort out on the
right, well this can go in then can it?
oh go on

Right, well that's good  well that's what we needed weren't it something like that?
It said forty five and one hour, though stirring occasionally  that'll do mum, cos you can use up the sausages

I know
Oh well
oh, oh look I'll have this tea and I'll go over and get something, the what?

Scissors where did they go?
Oh I've put them in the drawer, top drawer, the er kitchen drawer 
Well you must be losing some weight then mother
Oh it is true, but it did, it did do it, but that was the other day and I didn't think that they had the same effect, no, well perhaps so, mind you I mean we have done a lot of walking, haven't we?
But as I say
If those bus fares are going up like Sandra says
you'll be doing a lot more 
won't be worth going on the bus unless like I said you've got a great load to carry but then that could be worked out on a Saturday morning, it would mean going down there, after Tesco's that's the only thing
Yeah, well we can do that tomorrow because
You can't
I can't, I forgot
ha, mm
Mm
Well you might be home within an hour
Yeah
won't you?
That's the only way to look at it I'm afraid 
Oh bugger me I'm, there's no way I'm not doing it by the books
No
Can't afford to do that
No, don't blame you
I shall say well that's it, I'm a law abiding
Well no I mean it's not in your best interest and you wouldn't do it anyway, that's more to the point
Mm
You've never done it so you won't bloody start now, it's not worth all the hassle, for god sake, you know damn well it's wrong oh there's another load next door now, in a white van
Party time

I know I'm obviously not gonna take everything, am I?
Well 
Cos I wouldn't  fifty five, seventy, eighty, ninety five that'll do won't it?
That'll do, I mean there will be people who take the whole damn lot, although I don't want to be embarrassed
or just pick, pick out ones that
Well there's that one in the paper, I'll have that one, that'll probably go on longer that Tetley tea one  mm

No, I wonder where she's put the dogs?
Dunno  yeah but it don't mean to say that there's a lot come out, it could only be that lot, couldn't it?
Mm 
I mean you can't if you overload the kids

Yes  he is  I suppose
Eh?

No, can't do can he?
he wants all her attention when he does see her
Yeah, but then the times when she could be with him she's buzzing around in the car so what 
Oh yeah I know, what I'm saying is you can somewhat understand he's a noisy bastard 
T A T E R N 
Double T
Yeah, cater, mater, that sounds A R T, no there's only one R, count  well I just hope he brings one thing home
be interesting this bit on a bigger one won't it?
Ha  well if he can't do, if he can't bring nothing that man, which I'm sure he will I shall go and buy something, I mean that thing of Scott's won't be any good without the appropriate thing will it?
It's gotta be portable you see, that microphone of Scott's
Well does it have to be portable?
Well it's gotta be portable
Why?
Well cos it can't only be in here or in there, it's gotta be everywhere innit?
Gotta be, much simpler anyway
Simpler, yeah
Yeah, but erm, carry around, I mean you might want it at a minute's notice 
Withdraw, no W I T H  no  withdraws
Withdraws, you reckon 
No I didn't have it I had one of the W dish water

Of course you've done the neck I suppose
Mm 
Oh  oh don't want that then do we?
Oh no  look at her 
Oh no
Well it's a good cause innit?
I didn't mean that I mean this
Oh, what's happened now then?
You put the light on don't you?
I should think they would, so would I missus 
Oh well they won't win
Why?
Because they're favourites they won't win
Oh I see, aha, yeah, probably right 
Give me just a little more time and our love will surely show  
Heard about this have you?
Yeah
Oh I haven't 
a green frog has been the mascot
Oh I haven't heard anything about it at all 
there he is
Oh yeah, oh I don't know  that's very loud next door isn't it?
Mm 
what are they deaf in there?
Be interesting cos you can hear exactly what they're saying, mm  I say people like Simon and Doreen who don't erm televise much and you've got the telephone you told me don't you?
Erm
The other day  have that other one there 
Oh it could only of been at five thirty
Mm
they won't go yet
They might not go all night, but er
Well they were doing it at eleven o'clock last night, it must of been something like that because I heard every word 
Yeah over that  I mean sometimes you want to sit quiet and you cannot can you?
No
Yeah, well I dunno, do it all properly  I must do all my bits and pieces tonight, I haven't done them this week, oh let's have a look at the poll tax, because I thought there was one more, I'm sure there is
Yeah 
Sandra wasn't sure, I don't know, I'm sure there is
Yeah there is
turn on that and I've done mine 
But the kids are changed these days you know
The kids are what did you say?
Changed
Well I don't
not right is it?
Like, I would never of thought of
yeah, what you talking about him next door?
Or thingy
Well both 
Both , but this one next door Bev is pushed from pillar to post
Yeah
I mean 
he wants loving
he's a very kid where the mother's got to go to work
he wants loving
and I mean let's face it if he is still with the old grandmother, it's, that's a different world as well innit?
Mm
But this kid goes haywire and a lot of them do  I mean he's all crash bang wallop isn't he?
There's no
Wayne is though
Wayne yeah but she, she was his neighbours and that don't she?
That one down the road aren't they?
Yeah 
And all that, or at Betty's or, what have you, I don't think she'd leave them with the mother-in-law
No
but she leaves them with the neighbours or a neighbour, but I mean it's all different to bringing them up yourself, innit?
Gotta be, there a, it's a complex really because nobody will agree, erm, give, bringing up a kid will they?
No
Nobody and I don't ever think people will bring up somebody else's the same as they would their selves, I, I don't think it's possible for anybody to do it, I mean look at Julia when she was a, that childminder with that Kerry
No she didn't care
Julia didn't care a sod about that kid, she'd let her to scream on, stand in the middle of the garden screaming, indoors screaming and she said to me I have no feelings for her whatsoever but she took the bloody money every week and this is what's so wrong, nobody knows how she er was as that child, only people like us who would hear
Mm
and all Julia wanted was more and more and more money, there was a conflict on how many gran children she could have and sometimes she had five in there, one of them which was then very small which she had to spend time feeding and that and that was Kerry
Mm
well those others, three of those, somebody else's children plus her own ran total riot out in the garden, but I mean there's not enough people to come round and do spot checks even if they're allowed, I don't know whether they're allowed to, but they've 
I don't know if they can
No I don't, but nevertheless nobody knew only people like us and the neighbours, how that kid was every day when her mother to the T S B and her mother according to Julia had her because it was the done thing  her mother, her own mother wouldn't have her, Kerry to look after her  and I know that for a fact because one time when Ross was ill, Julia said I can't have her and she said oh god I suppose I've got to go and beg my mother to have her now  she did, but the woman said to Julia, I mean she wouldn't give up her job, they had a four bedroomed house, two bloody great cars, eleven cats
Mm
and er, I mean what she saw of Kerry was, she dropped her here at quarter to nine, she picked her up between five and half past and the rest of her she saw around kid, the rest of the time she saw her own kid and er Julia was to have her until she went to school, so I mean how can there be any bond there, which there can't, but the mother said herself I had her because it was the done thing  so I mean it's, it's today innit don't you think?
Mm
I mean all that kid do was scream, scream, scream, scream, I mean Ross wasn't the best one to be with, cos he was selfish and of course in Julia's eyes he never did any wrong but Kerry come off worse all the time and I said childminding is fine and it's necessary but the people, you know that, that people can't know people and Julia was a spoilt brat so
Mm 
I mean you must, if you're looking after a little girl, you must in the end, unless you've low and detest children, or unless you're out purely and simply for the money, I mean how can you
Not get a bond.
well how can you not get somewhat attached to a child, I mean of course there's children you don't like, like adults you don't like
Yeah, but then you still, if you see them every day
That's what I mean
you get somewhat attached to them
Julia felt nothing for that child, she didn't like her, she didn't hate her, I mean she, she didn't  she just felt nothing cos that's precisely what she told me, that's her words, not mine, you know and I find then, that, she shouldn't be a childminder
No 
that's my instant reaction, instant
Mm
that Julia wanted money more, more money, I mean he worked every hour that god gave at , so his money must of been decent, had to be
I don't think daddy would of let them
oh I don't know cos Julia was living with a bloke before that, I don't think they'll of had any say in it
Oh
and from what I understood he was already married anyway, never, never was mentioned here, but I did hear it, whether it was true or not I'm not say it, but I was told that he was already married and divorced to marry her, that was what I was told, no I mean I don't know, but  but I'm damn sure that I know
I hope this fucking kid don't play with that every day
That's alright, play with it, there's no point in saying anything to them Bev it's now got to be proven  and I say, if I can get it done and I can get it sent off, then they will point me in the right direction won't they?
Oh yeah
That's the, that's the whole point, you, you have to start somewhere, yes I can give her a bit of paper, yes she can throw it in the bin, it's made no difference, in fact I think it's getting worse since I spoke to her, isn't it?
She's had more people in there, the dogs have been left more hours that 
Ah that's just her situation
Fair comment, but this week she was on holiday, didn't stop her and going and leaving them poor dogs in there barking their heads off and crying, for seven and a half hours did it?
No 
I mean poor dogs and this, I mean we've said it all before it's not viable, four dogs and a semi that you don't exercise, four dogs that er appear particularly one of them to be housed in the same little area, day in day out with a curtain on the door, so that there's not even light going in there
That's so he can't see out in the garden
That's what?
So that he can't see what's going on, cos she thinks if he don't see what's going on he won't bark, but he cries  but I mean she shouldn't have them there, she's never here so she shouldn't have them, I mean look at the trouble Alan had to get Jessie, because they worked, but Emma goes home every lunch time to see to Jessie  from the bank, but I mean the woman  one of them wouldn't let her have a dog, one kennels, which is how it should be, but I mean this one breed those three herself so, yeah  I mean if you breed dogs yourself and you have three in the house of the same breed, what the hell do you want an alsatian for, as well but the whole point is she don't have them as enjoyment, she don't have them as company
Yeah, they're just there
They're their, their animals that's all like that chicken up the garden I mean I don't know what it's in, might be in a run, but being the place that is in behind that shed, there ain't that much space with a rabbit as well is there, you know, I mean, there might be a run on the floor, it'll be crazy to have a run on the floor because she's had rats
Oh
ain't she?
yeah
And she's had rats under that shed  it ain't that long ago she said, she said she had them  so I mean I can't see anybody with an ounce of common sense letting a chicken being on the ground, ground
Well no
who knows I don't know, I wouldn't, but who knows?
You're back to that situation of commonsense again ain't you?
Won't she?
Safe from
Safe from cuts, good heavens
What?
probably the er, poll tax are
 

Right, that was worth it, weren't it?
I think oh he's left out there his
 

Oh it's bubbling away nice
Stir him again then
What again?
It says stir occasionally
Oh  watch that dish, it's a bit hot that dish  right
no, just towels, good one, right whip it out for me then please, I'll have to leave it there because some of this is, still out there, ta  well that's not bad, time wise
No
Oh  I bet these kids find this thrilling you know, don't you?
God 
Barking dogs next door  barking dogs next door again, so I shall, plenty of material shouldn't we?
Subject to material 
god, yeah  The annoying, the most annoying thing about it
Yeah
is, is if she tries she can make it quiet in there
That's what she's supposed to do according to the Citizens Advice Bureau, is to control them so that she don't annoy the neighbours
Mm
Now Sunday when I had her about that terrific barking, your father was the first to say, look she stopped it
Yeah
but she lets them bark on like she lets the kids scream on, and that is today innit?
I think basically what it comes down to, it doesn't bother her
So why should it
so she doesn't care about anybody else
Mm
It can't bother her Bev because the amount of noise that we get through the walls is so bad and she's in it, she's actually there with the animals barking, so she takes no notice whatsoever of them
No
she's probably bloody used to it after all the years she must of had them, she tells 
can't 
she tells me they're all old dogs
But dogs whatever age don't 
Well 
make that noise
the way she said it that day was, they're old dogs, they don't need the exercise and they don't bark, that is the impression, impression I got 
It's not true so 
Now what's that point to spend an afternoon here  no point at all is there?
Not a lot
Well there isn't any more is there?
They wanna get that paper out
Sorry?
Do you think that put that paper through the
what out in the garage?
Yeah
I dunno, right let me do this and then I'll have a look  I mean I've got to do this because I'm not sure of it,
done now innit?
Mm
I wouldn't wanna do it tomorrow, well only later afternoon  but I mean if I have to put ear plugs in at night to get some sleep because of them, surely the authorities have gotta say something about that 
Well
well for god's sake, I mean I often wonder about people who make noise like this how they would feel if we did do the same, but I still say because we've done our polystyrene insulation she can't hear us, it's worked in the reverse ain't it?
Probably
Instead of us, you know, instead of it blocking out for our benefit, I reckon it blocked out for their benefit somehow  a hell of a lot of insulation, in here
Mm
a hell of a lot really, normally you wouldn't have the vinyl and normally I would think you would only put the tongue and groove not out of the polystyrene behind it and the vinyl, I can't see why people want tongue and groove that they go to all those lengths would you?
No
Well I don't think so tongue and groove is, is wood innit?
I don't know I mean I don't know nothing about these things, what, really have to feel that we are the lot 
Oh, and Us Girls, do we want that?
Well we'll see what's right
That's
wro , right then, eight o'clock, eight thirty, that's half an hour innit, er we'll have to turn it off then, er leave out the news and then put Casualty  that's half an hour, that's an hour  yeah, we'll have to knock out, just knock out the news because otherwise you've got to
back and that ain't you?
Mm 
Seven thirty  right, let's see what's on at six, the Crystal Maze or, eh?
I think it's
oh
on, the next generation,John Ireland, Robert Fuller, Ben Cartright is dead
Oh
his brother arrives in Boston before he, miners who want the miners families' ranch  that goes on till seven thirty
Oh bloody hell
well other than that we've got

Go to bloody sleep kid!
Ooh!
If only I had my thing!
He's just like Ross isn't he?
Mm.
Can you hear him?
No, I just heard the door go though.
Yeah.
Thing is, you know  he's not next door to here, he's out on the  in in the  lawn area isn't he?
Our lawn area.
That's where the bedroom is innit?
Well I wonder how much of the bedroom?
Erm 
When you see Helen next
Yeah, I'll ask her.
ask her.
I will.
Yeah.
Wanna know how much the  bedroom is out there?
No, I don't know.
Cos it's cos if it's got 
I can't really remem Ay?
couple of square feet
I can't remember.
it's coming  into your  area.
Yeah.
Maybe.
So you might have the door to the  kid's  bed underneath that wall.
See, he never used to be in this bloody room!
He was on the other room when she came here.
In the other room, at the other end.
That's why I never heard weren't it?
Mm.
But then she changed bedrooms lo , when that  bloody  other bloke came here.
But he's not happy kid!
No.
Oh!
Yeah  but the quiet ones .
I dunno whether those people went you know.
They must have done.
Must of done  tonight.
Cos, I say the car was down the road.
I've never known that!
Never!
Do you know what?
Mm?
I know it's a horrible thing to say
Mm?
but  it's a shame nobody else
Mm?
got woken up last night.
Sort of somebody's put the  the road.
If somebody wanted to get out quickly
Yeah.
and couldn't
Yeah.
and they went to the wrong door  and said is this car anything
Well tha , that's right!
I mean erm  I
Because say  Gail and Keith go got woken up at three o'clock in the morning
Yeah.
and said 
That's right!
is that your car outside?
Yeah.
Well Alan did it here one, one time.
Yeah.
And it wasn't us.
No, but you know what I mean?
Yes I do know what you mean.
Well
It'll be unfortunate for the couple that, whoever got woken up
Yeah.
But it might do something.
I know what you're meaning.
Cos you dunno what Alan might have done.
Ay?
You dunno what Alan might have done.
Well 
If that car was there and
Yeah.
It, I think he got out and I I do  he , I said to you and your father how he got out I just dunno!
Cos it's a very difficult road this.
Yeah.
But I think he did  probably just, because when I got up  er  when I co , you see when I come down the stairs I can see through that window look
Mm.
and  Alan's light was on in the hall, call it the hall  and the car was there  well a little while later  he went.
I think he got out  but I don't think it would have been easy, there's  that time this morning.
And, I've never known these people  put the car down by George's!
So, knowing Alan, do you remember somebody  used to park their car in front of Alan's gate when they went to London?
Yeah.
And he left a note on the windscreen.
But I mean Alan has to go up to London!
It's not long after six o'clock in the morning that he leaves.
But er  , I fully understand what you're saying.
Really!
Well I say  some  let's say Sandra wanted to get out
Yeah.
and couldn't  and can't 
Yeah!
Yeah!
Right?
Yeah.
And she should be able to.
But another thing is you see  where Sandra lives, you saying that  where she lives is apparently  erm  P C , now I don't know him, but she does  he lives up the same road  and when people park  didn't she tell you this when we were coming down?
No , I don't mean that Sandra, I meant this one!
Oh Sandra over here?
Right?
Yeah.
Let's just say she couldn't out
Yeah.
and she went to Claire and George tonight
Yeah.
and said is  anybody staying with you?
Oh yeah, that'd do it!
That would do it wouldn't it?
But, what I was gonna say was  concerning them blocking these pavements  if the 
I know as we I was there when she 
You were there when she said about P C .
Well if we had some  I know there's two policemen up round the corner here.
Cos they walk down here, here 
Is there any one in ?
Well P C  I think  is an older policeman.
Yeah, that's what I meant.
Mm.
These are two  young-uns I reckon they lodge up here somewhere.
Not this road  but round  where Colin and 
any policemen isn't she?
Ay?
You what?
The lodger, policeman.
Who did?
Linda.
Yeah, she did didn't she?
A nice one.
I forgot that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But you see somebody like P C , being an older person  he does it properly I suppose, is what 
Yeah.
the answer is.
He goes and knocks people's door and says you're blocking the pavement!
Well if he'd have come down here that night, or that day  when there was three cars in  in the drive and one  right across the pavement, and then that  that big lorry on the pavement  he'd have had them wouldn't he?
Yeah.
Went to bed and er of course the kid went berserk didn't he?
And er god you should of heard him, god if it ain't Ross all over again, mummy, mummy and she left him there, as I said when they first came he was in the far bedroom, well now I suppose with all these people she's rearranged it indoors and he's in the one next to our house, and she's shouting at him and er it went on how, I can't tell you how long, I mean, Bev and I was talking through bedrooms you know
Mm
and er, it was gone eleven I would of thought, anyway he stopped and I slept like a log, got up at twenty past six, but erm, it's a strange thing because one of those came last evening and it parked outside George's, now I said yesterday, when Alan goes to work, it's not long after six normally to go up to London and that
Mm
and I said to both of them, I just don't know how he got past that second car in the road right, come out of his drive, I couldn't believe that he could of done it, but he did, because he went you know 
Yeah 
anyway last night, they parked outside George's so I reckon, I mean it's only us thinking he's put a note in the door because he will do this, because when a bloke used to leave his car outside Alan's gate, others, instead of the station
Yeah
Alan left a note on his windscreen


but er, I don't know how he got out yesterday and I've never, never know him parked down the road, not at all, anyway we got, I got home and erm, I said to Bev you know, right go and phone Lesley see if she's in and then I did a bit of housework and then the phone rang, ooh, we was aiming to go out at one and that must of been ten to one, and it was Liz
Oh yeah
and er I said to Bev well you do what you like, you know, she went out, the first time she's answered the phone, since
Yeah
Anyway er Liz said can you come over like today so Bev said yes what does it entail?
Liz got quite cross you know she's quite oh bugger it, you know, and er she said to Liz what's the hours?
Oh I dunno you'll have to talk to Ian, she said I've been working Les done, er Les, Les told me eleven till three, it was half past eleven till three and er, so Bev was alright 
That's exactly what we do
Yes, well Bev was asking, I mean I was doing housework, oh, I was doing bits and pieces you know, and er getting me coat and all that and er  she was asking questions and all that and Liz said I'll pick you up at twenty past eleven, so Bev said alright then, so she come off the phone said she'd go and have a look and apparently erm, it must of been yesterday if, if Liz is telling the truth she said to whoever are you going to do anything about this?
And he said oh yeah, so, I said to Bev well, they had the feeling it was haphazard or whatever the word be, anyway
So she's going over about it 
she's going over at half past eleven and she said to me if it's not worth the money I'm not changing and er, I shall tell him that I've certainly got to go on the books you know 
Mm 
can't do it any other way, so I said oh I'll go and have a look, I've got to go down town and
that's right
that's right, I mean she's, she's took some money, or taken some money if, I mean she'll be home twelve o'clock if it don't suit her like
Yeah
she'll only get a taxi, if er, she thinks it not viable, but er, it, it to me, it just seems not buggering about, but
I mean there are some places like that and
There are
people are quite happy to work there
Mm
and the pay is
Mm
pretty okay
Yeah, well I mean I don't know what she's been earning this Liz, but
oh where we going today then?
yeah
Who knows perhaps it's one of his days out
God knows, I don't, well so we'll see 
 
we was late weren't we?
Or later
Yeah
he's a bit like her sort of in a dream
Did er
he doesn't realize that you're sort of there seeing him
did erm, did he ask you if you had a roof rack?
No
No
a what?
A roof rack, he wants to borrow one for Sunday, cos Susan's coming back look, anyway she asked me and I said no we've never had one, I don't think we ever had, I said I'll ask Doreen, so I asked Doreen and she said yes we have, but I'd have to ask Leslie first, so when Dee come back I said yes she has, but don't say anything to her cos you might not get it, but she's not getting that.
No Margarette's got, erm the two bars hi Doreen 
Morning Doreen 
you know when you get two bars as opposed 
Mm 
to a complete effort
Oh I know what I was gonna say
on her 
Norman Gates , they're trying to clo close Norman Gates
Yeah that's been in the erm Echo 
Oh dear me 
That's been in the papers the last few weeks
there's a person down the bottom, you know in Paul's old house, their little kid goes there, I didn't know nothing about it.
Yeah, their, they're still behind
aren't they?
I think they are actually yeah  yeah I don't know
Cos the other, that's it, that's, what's the one we've got up by us?
What Walberdeen?
I've go the Walberdeen one
Yeah, yeah, is that a special school?
Somewhat
Oh
yes it's not a normal one, but I don't 
No 
quite know
no, I mean years ago that's where we all went that 
Yes 
area you see
No Anton took over 
normal school yeah
Anton Junior
Yeah
took over from Walberdeen
Yeah, but er, it says two hundred and something for the
two, seventeen was it?
That's what the Echo says for the 
Yeah 
town and then when you go out and in villages 
yeah 
it
yeah  but actually the paper boy was late this morning and we didn't get erm mid week
Didn't you?
No
if there's one here I'll take it, I've done up Howard's
Had mine Monday night again
No we didn't get one, I, I've gotta go to the post office today so any post that's gotta go there I said I'll take the lot and save tomorrow lot
Mm 
Mm 
and er got, no we never had one cos Les said no I remember we didn't get one this week, cos she would of had a look through you know
Yeah
so if there's one here I'll have it
Mm, what, where
That's that woman who looks after Dee Dee's sister
Mm
does that and all, and er  she had a da , she went to the authorities about that woman
Yeah, did she get anywhere?
Well I don't know, but she, I said, cos she's telling me about her coming, only three days up the hospital then she's gotta go back to her own place because Ian said she'd never managed, she keeps falling and she said this woman never went to see her once when she was in hospital, yet she's getting paid it look all the time, and she ought to go to see if there's anything she wants you see
Yeah
and er, I said, morning, I said er
Morning
has she been any better this woman cos she was always on about her, and she said no, she said I went to higher authorities about it, is that it?
is letting another, so many off, don't know what it said
I would think so, I don't know how many it was
Eh?
are laying some more off
Yeah cos I
no I, it would 
interview 
it was double figures but I can't erm, I can't remember
eh?
but er, as I say I can't remember precisely, I just scanned it and give it to Mick who was out the door like, Lesley put her house up for a hundred and twenty six  erm, one  how much is it?
a hundred thousand, a hundred and twenty six thousand, hundred and twenty six thousand
That four bedroomed detached?
Yeah, yeah en suite 
She might get it
Eh?
She might
well it's er, it's a funny thing that is because they all gone, now they were supposedly around a hundred thousand look, when they took it on and they've all gone, there ain't any there new ones
But she still hasn't had any body in to see it
No but it is a strange thing because sometimes you get my end of the market and you get somebody wants her end of the market, but erm
Well the ones that have got more money, you know, the maximum money
Yeah
they're gonna go for the best there is
Oh they're gonna go for
 
and they're gonna go out of town detached 
Yeah, yeah
as much as they can get 
that's right 
as opposed to 
Yeah
I mean up our road they don't fetch that much, but there are one or two
Yeah
even bigger and more detached than ours
Mm, yeah, but erm
but, you know
it's not even 
get a choice of two 
it's not even something like
cos their er home yesterday look Jody went back to work and there was Bill and Scott
He's still at school?
Yeah
Yeah, another year
and er, she's got two more raises at school, they'll give him a credit and then wrote him a letter saying that he'll probably be expelled again, of course she went busting up there
No wonder you said about the credit
Yeah
Thought he turned over
Yeah
a new leaf 
yeah , well the thing was he Peter gave him a key 
 
Peter gave him a key to come in the flat any time, you know, of course he did didn't he, he was
well you know what he had in there, he's now got one girlfriend, he ditched Paula
 

This one comes from Southampton, but he worked on it didn't he?
Out of work again isn't he?
Well I said to her my god you've got a load of
you've got a load of problems
Absolutely
She has, she really has 
what?
It's wet innit?
It must of rained cos I, the thing here pots full of water
Yeah, well it, well, I
got up late, twenty past six, the kid was going berserk when we went to bed
We erm, were they?
The kid was
Yeah
my erm, screaming, shouting
The garden was dry out the front on the top you know 
Yeah 
like summer and it's wet today
Yeah, but erm
as I say we went to bed her and I
Mm
and he was well
Yelling
she was shouting at him, didn't hear any dogs, and erm, it was gone eleven, must of been
Yeah it was 
before it stopped and then of course I slept like a bloody log until about twenty past seven
Yeah and you er I ov I overslept, well I woke up at five and normally I think if I go to sleep now and I sort of get myself awake but today I must of turned over
Yeah
and it was right on six when I got up 
yeah 
I don't have to come out until seven
no
near, well not quite seven so I mean I don't have to do a lot but I just liked to er take my time and you know 
Well I, I did nothing , I did nothing you see because erm, by the time I'd been in the bathroom done the sandwiches
Yeah
blah, blah, got myself a cup of tea, blah, blah, blah, got on me coat
Mm
out the door and that really is, I mean half past eight the other day it was awful
Mm
awful, but by god did he go, I said to Sandra it's Ross all over again, funny innit but she's got no 
But did she, did a 
time for him Doreen
Well that is the trouble I expect you see
he's pushed from pillar to post this kid
Like the other one
erm and when she has all these people in, he's up, he's not in bed
No
he, er, he, when he went, when he first come there, he used to go to bed seven o'clock
Mm
but she said, well the last lot that I've got
but one of the times when we were not chatty, but talked, she said how naughty he'd got, but I mean she's never with him
Well, cos I mean if he goes to school now and he didn't, he picked up things and then
Well I, I
he's not got 
he's, he's 
time for and well that is it innit, well if she's not got time for him 
Well what do you mean?
Well that is it, not got the patience have they?
But he weren't like that when they came he weren't like erm Wayne, Celia's Wayne, I mean he's been like it forever 
Yeah 
and Ross was rotten spoilt, you know, there's
but this one seems to of gone haywire, oh does he go, but as I say she's changed the bedrooms you see, he used to be on the far end
Mm
erm with an outside wall but he's not
Can't be helped with the
can it in those rooms with the dogs
No, well that boy had to
a day off didn't he?
Oh
Anyway I'm hopeful that he'll be in today, because I mean the noise won't stop, so I mean when I report it, it just goes on
Mm, mm
it just goes on, but I said to Sandra where they've been parking all these cars, Alan over the road he comes out just after six o'clock and goes to London every day and I don't know how he got his car out with the 
No 
but he did, anyway last night when these, this car arrived, they parked it down the road outside George's, well I've never known that and I reckon Alan's put a note through the door
Could of done, yeah
but I, I mean Bev said you ought to go over at six o'clock in the morning, bang the bloody door 
Yeah make them get up and say can you move
Yeah, yeah


I don't know how he got out, I mean our road is so difficult anyway, of course there wa , that night there were two, yeah two when them, he had to get out in the morning, but er, I mean he did it, but I expect it was a struggle
Mm
you know you have to go backwards and forwards
Yeah
shake yourself round, but I've never know that last night
Yeah sometimes when Rosemary was here, we didn't have any bother or anything but now and again somebody, she did their hair at the time 
Oh yeah 
dress making and er somebody would park outside our house, not by the drive, but there but to get in Les had to swing over and round 
That's it 
and then when they were
he couldn't swing much so he had to go down and back in but er
That's what you have to do 
it was only occasionally, I mean no bother with it or each other 
I mean this is virtually every day
Yeah
every day now, now I mean I don't know how many she's got living in there or what they've got living in there, they stay 
 
overnight and if they generally do that it's two more car loads
Mm
We've got British Telecom outside our house for six weeks
Yeah
the other morning I
hell of a squeak of brakes and they had two vans and as you used to turn the corner by Swatons, the bollards are out
Yeah
the wrong, the wrong side of the road, of course you've got the blind bend, somebody had gone round there, somebody else was coming down old Whitton Road legally 
Mm, mm 
Oh my god 
and they sort of met and how they didn't hit I don't know  but at the moment it's, well get the car back today it's er been away being done, cos somebody smashed into him
Oh no 
he managed to pull it out, he, they smashed all the front wing in, he was parked
outside a customer's house and all of a sudden there was a knock at the door
getting to the end, you know the important bit of the sale
Someone bashed you 
got 
and it was a young girl next door, a car
backed out of her parents' drive
Mm
well drove out and turned, her bumper caught Mick's wing and right up against the wheel so imagine to pull it out to drive it and the driver said oh won't claim on the insurance she said, erm, I'll pay it, get three estimates and let me have them and Mick said it's gonna be about three hundred quid, well if it had gone through the insurance he could then have put in for a hire car
Oh yeah
of course he couldn't, he said oh well he said what's the point
so he hadn't been working, earning money, he knocked a hole in the dining room from the lounge wall yesterday 
Well I, I, I have got 
cos I say 
and the worse is the mess is, my god
Well I have to say Sandra that I would, alright you've got a lot of mess, but I have to say I'd sooner have one like that than


well we've tongued and grooved
Just as well we haven't got next door neighbour 
right 
joined on
tongued and grooved or, or something pine for the kitchen wall, do it, pay it, forget it right, so, I mean I don't know what wood I mean we'd have, we'd have to see it, but I said to him look I said something's gotta be done, so I said to him shall we get Gary  or somebody similar to do some Artexing in here and he said well with the coal fire and all that he said it'll, it'll get dirty
Mm
which it will won't it?
Mm
And erm, so I said alright then give me some suggestions, because when we moved out of erm Milton Avenue, Diane and Harry immediately did the walls wood in the kitchen, about the same size as mine
Mm
and it looked like
Andrew's got that in his bathroom half way, that's what he said 
 
and then he's got a moulded piece along the top of it and then he's 
Yeah 
got the wall paper, it looks ever so nice
 
does, does it?
rubbed it all down and
And that would be alright in a, in a bathroom you know
Dean's got a complete pine bathroom
Has he?
he's boxed his bathroom in pine and 
 
that wood stuff and then varnished
well I said to him
It looks nice very nice it looks 
look I said I don't mind vinyl, I don't mind good vinyl the only good, the only one that, it was good for the toilet, but I got it in a pack cos we've got such a small single toilet
Mm
I got it in a pack outside Fads
Mm
but if you believe the proper price
Mm
I mean it was just three rolls 
I know it's terrible the price of it, weren't it?
When you go, at Tesco's they've got a sale ain't they?
that, that quick one Texas
Yeah
twenty five is it or twenty percent off or something, but I think I don't know some of the stuff when you 
Well I said to him look, I said I know I'm fed up with this thing next door, and I don't want to stay there, but Alan said that I've got to stay there, right, so I said to him, you know, we have to start doing something and I said to him something permanent because he ain't a handy man, I mean he'll do it, because I mean it's something like measuring steel innit?
Let's be honest 
But you've got to keep on and that yeah, that's right, yeah 
but I said to him, I'll go and buy vinyl and we can come back into the same position, and he ain't no good at sticking vinyl up, I always go round with a bloody
then I have to do something I suppose before we look round it'll be August we'll be off to Malta
Mm and then it's the winter again 
and then he'll look round and 
winter comes so quick
So quick and he said alright then I erm, I said well where shall we go and he said there's plenty of places
Mm
to buy wood
I mean I know nothing
As I say next we're getting this Phillip's
this Phillip, he does a lot, I mean I don't like Phillip's but as I say
my Ian says that, Ian says that
That's a lot, I mean that wooden fence we had I mean, a lot of garden fences are dear, but it was a pound cheaper in the garden centre at Tesco's 
We've got one there
Most of B & Q stuffs are cheaper
B & Q's nice
Yeah, where is that builders that 
There's one at Thatcham
Thatcham?
just outside Newbury you have to go on the M four 
B & Q at, one at Basingstoke
Is there?
it's on the dual carriageway as you go in on the 
But if not , otherwise I'm gonna go up the
I mean I shout up to the bathroom, I mean
There's a big one at Millbrook
Tim's coming up to move the bath back and all that you see, this old bath and erm, do some pipe work, but until that's all done, erm, er, until this woman is sorted out, because if I find in the end we've got to insulate again, then I know how I feel, I mean that tongue and groove going up polystyrene in the lounge and yesterday I think he's got a new organ
yeah, I think it's an organ, and that, that is all in those two recesses, now, you know if I find you know that I don't get anywhere and I can't see that I won't, but if, because the bathroom is where the dog is there, of course consequently that comes through the corner of the lounge
Mm
erm, well before wherever you put anything, you know, finished article on the bathroom wall, that one wall we might have to do whatever they allow
Mm
because this is, I mean I didn't hear the dogs last night, only the kid, but I mean nevertheless the day before if you'd of been in there, so but, but the kitchen can be done, toilet can be done
Mm
We don't want tiles now look
and I think he's got all the tiles now there's a load of tiles going cheap in there
I know, and this is what I said, he said I know I don't really want the old vinyl, do it anyway
oh it's a pig of a job
Yeah I remember you have to
It's alright if your walls are absolutely
Yeah they're not
flat
I mean I remember Mike  I mean that house had
 
mine is absolutely I mean it's, it looks fine and it's done, but if you actually put the skirt level there are actual places 
Mm, mm yeah 
Well when you walked in my porch when those blokes were doing it, you walked in there, I mean it's nice, it's a wrong suite for the for the room, too narrow the room for one of those
Mm
I think
Mm
but the minute you walk in a shop, pretty curtains, Austrian blinds, a new shower
the minute you walk in there you look at this lump
Our wall is flat 
because the wall 
but when Pete was doing the sides of the erm lounge and he erm put that coving up
round it 
and got sort of in the hall, ha, and you can just about see it 
Yeah 
now, it's sort of wall goes 
your eyes go on it 
down 
Oh yes
and he said crikey look at this, what am I gonna do here and he sort of had to fill quite a big gap in, but he sort of pushed it and filled it and then the wallpaper goes up so you can just see it, a little bit, what's a name now, just in the hall there's a bit 
Ours shows because it's not a bold pattern it's very subdued
Mm
but it's a lot like a chevron
Mm, mm
so you've got your pattern down, because when you've got something like that 
Yeah 
it's fine, until, unless you actually look
that's right yeah 
go all round the ceiling line, round, the pattern all matches, and the pattern
Yeah
you walk round the room this side and it's all level, it's when you get up the top
Yeah, it's just in this one top part in the corner
well the bit where it meets, pattern should be over the door, so it's not until you're in the room and looking back out 
not back over, yeah 
but when he did it I said oh my god you know I said yeah, but you know it's there
Yeah, like where I sit in my chair if I look up there I can see it, but as I say it's not there all the wallpaper 
 
it doesn't, but when he first sort of put it up, I thought oh crumbs look at that 
Yes, I must admit I had one or two people going up the loo and looking, I mean people stop and look when we first had all the stuff outside, you know, what you doing in there?
Because then they could see the conservatory gradually taking shape
Mm
but 
yeah lovely
it will be nice when it's done, I mean last weekend he sorted out the doorway which wasn't half knocking out
but Annette was out yesterday after work and she come in and she sort of opened the door, good god she said just as well I'm not sitting in to watch television, well you couldn't


until about half past nine, when they said right that's all the dir dirty work done, he said I'm going up to have a shower and he put the carpet, rolled the carpet half back, and picked up a load of mess and we had polythene dust sheets over it


and the dust that had got underneath was absolutely thick 
Mm, you wouldn't know , you wouldn't believe it would you?
the television the video and all that
When they'd be just our, our patio doors for weeks on, still finding dust
Well you do
washed and
Mick was drilling, he put the framework round to drill up against
hammer drill, he says to me do us a favour so I said what?
He said stand there


with the hose of the vacuum cleaner with the nozzle on
yeah 
so while he's drilling
sucking it up 
Of course he's tried to get under a polythene sheet to contain it
Right, is like the dentist 
it was hot, it was dust in that hammer drill, god it makes a noise, it did, it certainly saved a lot though
Yeah
it filled the hoover bag twice, the old vacuum cleaner
Yeah it was like when my mother-in-law had the 
But if, if he hadn't been doing that
it was awful up and down 
Well if we want this kitchen, well a lot of it is tiled anyway you know part ways up, erm I said to him whatever it costs, it'll be done 
They obviously didn't like it, there was nothing dif , there wasn't definitely said but there was some 
Yeah 
comment, and another time I'd lit up a cigarette you know

Sue was on about her daughter living with that bloke like, I don't know if it was the same bloke, I just dunno, yes it is, yes it is, it's gotta be the one, when she broke her shoulder, it's gotta be, anyway he got no job and Sarah got this good job apparently wherever it is, I can't remember where it was
well she got what she wanted then, whatever it is anyway, she's keeping him virtually and they got this flat, whatever they've got, and erm
Long wearing tan
yeah, they'll be, and she's always moaning driving Sue up the wall, why should I keep him blah, blah, blah, blah, doing nothing, we sit and look at each other and Sue said for Christ sake she said you're twenty years old, not forty, she'd been bad on and off again, throat, well she had the shoulder, throat er she thought she had, oh the diabetes was one weren't it, diabetes one, they thought she had, thought that she had glandular fever but she hasn't and er, so Sue said to her well are you looking after yourself and she said yes I am, Sue said well I dunno she never seems to be, cos she's never been well has she really?
No
I mean you have to wonder
I mean they all joined the club but Sue used to
mm, anyway not only that one Emma erm  been

Yeah she's a couple of years younger so she's 
Mm 
probably got A levels this May, whatever
erm should she pack up her Saturday job, it pays around twenty pound and it will go up to about twenty five, and Sue and Will sat and talked about it and she got, she's surprising been interviewed for the W R A F but I mean that's not gonna be so easy these days, I mean they're gonna take the exceptionals that they need aren't they?
And Sue said she's got nothing in view apart from that and she said to her you must have alternatives, she's not applied to anybody or enquired about anything
Police Force are recruiting

Government said that you now get
 
well Hampshire was supposed to have some more weren't they?

well, erm tisn't, she's not, she wants the W R A F and nothing else and Sue said you can't be like that, you know, and er, so they've decided that she's gotta carry on with this Saturday job because she won't be able to go on the dole look, straight away will she?
No

something , something like, like that, anyway so she said er
she said it's hard enough for people with jobs to exist today without all this and she's gone back to college on the flexi idea, erm, brush up her typing because she said, now whether she's thinking of future years, she said when she left here that time, although she got that job she said it wasn't easy, she said because I had no bits of paper as such, although when I did the test I passed it, she said it wasn't simple, so she's doing
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and not sure about Friday evening and er she said then she'll have trouble getting the money over that's out of them, why the redundancy because been there over two year, so I presume redundancy or holidays or both so Sue said to her well if they were so good to you in the past, but that ain't the point is it?
They did all, they did
Mm
