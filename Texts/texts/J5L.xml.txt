Invite you to support Drs Anthony & Maggie Barker's 700-mile tandem trek in aid of the British Defence & Aid Fund for Southern Africa
Unit 22, The Ivories, Northampton Street, London N1 2HX
Anthony and Maggie Barker will set off from Glasgow on 30 March on their 10-day, 700-mile cycle ride.
The BDAFSA is the national affiliate in Britain of the International Defence and Aid Fund for Southern Africa.
The Fund works to ensure legal defence of the victims of apartheid; to provide support for families and dependants of those imprisoned and detained — such as food, clothing, rent and education for their children.
The Fund also implements a programme of information and education about apartheid.
WHAT IS BDAFSA?
We appeal to you to provide generous sponsorship for this initiative by the Drs Maggie and Anthony Barker.
Funds are urgently needed to ensure defence in the growing number of political trials and for needy families.
Drs Anthony and Maggie Barker, average age 70 years, spent 30 years building up a medical service in rural South Africa.
After retirement they returned to that country to assist in the clinic in the embattled township of Alexandra, outside Johannesburg.
INTRODUCING THE BARKERS
When they came back to Britain they embarked on a 1,200-mile tandem ride across the Dolomites and the Alps to raise funds for the Alexandra clinic.
They are, personally, bearing all the costs of the ride so that all monies raised will benefit the Fund.
