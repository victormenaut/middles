Face trace
THIS photograph was taken at RAF Abu-Suer in Egypt in 1946.
I would like to trace the man on the extreme right, who was a great friend, although I cannot now recall his surname.
He was ‘Scouse’ to us all, and I think he came from Wirral.
We worked on an antimalaria unit and he would remember me as ‘Taff’ Jenkins.
He would now be about 66.
He can write, or reach me on .
Ship reunion
THIS year sees the 50th anniversary of the launch of HMS Khedive, an assault fighter aircraft carrier which operated with distinction in the South of France landings and in the Aegean Sea, and later against the Japanese.
A reunion of the ship's company is to be held in the RNA Club, Leamington Spa, on Saturday, July 3, and I invite all members to contact me for details on  or by letter.
Letters please Write to The Editor (Veterans' Postbag), Daily Post, Liverpool L69 3EB.
Alex spins to success
LANCASHIRE spinner Alex Barnett had Essex on the rack on the third day of their championship match at Old Trafford today.
Barnett grabbed the crucial wickets of dogged nightwatchman Mike Garnham and England captain Graham Gooch in a morning spell of 9–5–10–2 as Essex slipped from 116 for one to 169 for four in reply to Lancashire's 321.
Garnham had earlier frustrated Lancashire, and especially medium pacer Phil DeFreitas.
He survived a fiery burst from Wasim Akram, then cracked DeFreitas for three boundaries in an over.
Garnham top edged a pull from DeFreitas, but Gehan Mendis dropped an easy chance.
Gooch moved to his 50 his third in eight days at Old Trafford with his sixth four, off DeFreitas.
But Barnett denied Garnham his half century as he missed a full toss and fell lbw.
He had Salim Malik in trouble, but Gooch went next leg before.
Malik was caught behind off Mike Watkinson, leaving Essex on 142 for four.
Derek Pringle then cracked three boundaries off Watkinson, and Essex were later 248–6 off 65 overs.

Recall and share wartime memories
FOR months we have been mesmerised by stories of the Battle of the Atlantic.
But there were other wartime landmarks 50 years ago…and we want to hear readers' memories.
First, in May, 1943, as the tide of war turned against the U-boat wolf packs, a smaller group of British heroes struck deep into German territory.
They became famous as the Dambusters when they wrecked the Ruhr valley dams with Barnes Wallis's revolutionary bouncing bombs after training in Derbyshire's Derwent valley.
The drone of the Lancaster aircraft's four Rolls Royce Merlin engines was heard regularly as Wing Commander Guy Gibson and the men of 617 Squadron practised their low-level bombing techniques.
The raid devastated Hitler's strategically vital industrial zone in the Ruhr by breaching the Eder and Molne dams.
The water from these served vital coal mines and iron works and more than 300m gallons were lost.
Of the 133 RAF aircrew who took off on the night of May 16, 56 failed to return.
Then, on September 6, 1943, Italy, the Germans' major ally, surrendered.
Allied troops were put ashore at Salerno and Hitler ordered the disarming of Italian troops and their deportation to Germany for forced labour.
The Germans entered Rome while the Italian king, Victor Emmanuel, and Marshal Pietro Badoglio, who had ousted Mussolini, fled to territory held by the Allies.
Were you involved in either of these events in any way?
We will pay £25 for the most vivid, moving or humorous memories.
The loan of photographs will also be appreciated.
Any sent will be copied and sent back by return of post.
Articles cannot be returned so senders should keep copies.
We also welcome letters for our Veterans' Postbag and details of service association meetings.
Please send memories or photos to: The Editor (War Diary), Daily Post, Liverpool L69 3EB.
Our War Diary desk will be open for queries from 10am-4pm every Friday on , ext 2435.
Gala occasion
MEMBERS of the public are invited to attend a celebration gala at Bowring Park, Liverpool, on June 26.
The event will mark the centenary of William Bowring's appointment as Liverpool's first Lord Mayor and celebrate the gift of the park to the people of the city in 1906.
Agassi almost certain to play
ANDRE Agassi's first tournament appearance for two months was still up in the air last night even though he officially withdrew from next week's grass court event in Halle.
Organisers of the German tournament have kept aside a wild card for the American, who is suffering from tendonitis of the right wrist, should he decide at the 11th hour that he is fit to play.
Agassi's agent Bill Shelton said from Washington: ‘Andre is 99% certain to take the wild card.
Things are looking a lot better than 48 hours ago.
He has had two good days of practice.’
‘Serious’
But Steffi Graf's injury is more severe than earlier believed, and it still is ‘not a certainty’ she will be able to defend her women's singles title at Wimbledon.
The French Open champion has ‘a serious condition that will have to be taken care of in a substantial way,’ said her agent, Phil de Picciotto.
Graf is suffering from periostitis, an inflammation of the membrane of the tissue covering a bone in her right foot.
She reportedly was injured in her quarterfinal match at the French Open and received pain-killing injections before her semi-final and final matches.
‘She will start training for Wimbledon this weekend,’ added her agent, but he admitted her playing in the year's third Grand Slam tournament was ‘not a certainty’.
Festival finale cruise
MERSEY Ferries are offering the opportunity to view the finale of the annual Mersey River Festival from one of their boats.
More than 100 vessels will take to the Mersey on June 20 when there will also be an air display over the river.
The three-hour ferry cruise will feature a live commentary about the vessels taking part.
There will also be a licensed bar and buffet.
Tickets are priced at £5 for adults, £2.50 for children and £12.50 for a family.
They are available from Pier Head Ferry Terminal or Seacombe Ferry Office.
The ferry will leave Seacombe at 11.10am, Woodside at 11.20am and Pier Head at 11.30am.
Big splash for charity

GRANT FOX kicked a last minute penalty to give the All Blacks a sensational 20–18 victory over the unlucky British Lions in Christchurch today.
Trailing 18–17, Fox denied the Lions victory with a kick from more than 40 yards that wiped out a magnificent kicking effort by Lions captain Gavin Hastings.
Hastings claimed all the Lions points with six penalties, equalling the record for a Lion set by Tony Ward in South Africa in 1980.
Fox, the second most prolific Test kicker of all time, was equal to the nerve-jangling ordeal of winning the Test with a kick from 47 yards when Dean Richards was penalised in a ruck.
The Lions led three times at 6–5, 9–8 and tantalisingly at 18–17 between the 71st and 79th minutes.
As they clung to their one point lead, they tackled ferociously, but one marginal infringement cost the game.
Wrestled
New Zealand held the lead for long periods and their frequent advantages depended on the only try of the match.
That came as early as the 88th second when Fox kicked to the corner and centre Frank Bunce wrestled the ball from Ieuan Evans.
The rest of the match comprised penalty attempts by the two great kickers.
Hastings was on the mark in the 10th, 17th, 35th, 49th, 53rd and 71st minutes.
Fox's five kicks came in the 21st, 39th, 43rd, 51st and 79th minutes.
His second success took him to 1,000 points as an All Black, his record including non-Test matches.
The Lions were agonizingly close, but history shows that New Zealand are almost unbeatable by British teams on their own turf.
The score is 25 Tests to the All Blacks and only five to British sides in rugby history.
New Zealand: J Timu, E Clarke, F Bunce, W Little, V Tuigamala; G Fox, A Strachan; C Dowd, S Fitzpatrick (capt), O Brown, I Jones, R Brooke, J Joseph, Z Brooke, M Jones.
Replacement: M Cooper for Little.
British Lions: A G Hastings (capt); I C Evans, J C Guscott, W D C Carling, R Underwood, C R Andrew, C D Morris; N J Popplewell, K S Milne, A P Burnell, M C Bayfield, A I Reed, B B Clarke, D Richards, P J Winterbottom.

Junior show time
HARRY CONNICK Junior at 25 (right) has been hailed as the new Frank Sinatra and tomorrow a packed Liverpool Empire will sit entranced, no doubt, listening to the man and his jazzy style of laid back music.
But did you know the sharp-suited musician from New Orleans has already been tinkling away for more than 22 years!
‘Harry first touched a keyboard at the age of three.
His parents were lawyers and when his father was sworn in Harry played at the ceremony at the age of six!
‘Everyone's wild about Harry,’ said a spokesman.
‘He's really looking forward to this visit.’
MARGI CLARKE: Everyman.
Review by Penny Kiley.
I DON'T think there is a female equivalent for the word ‘phallic’.
But if there is, it would probably fittingly describe the stage backdrop for Margi Clarke's new show 21st Century Scut.
The outrageous design of the show is down to Jamie Reid and Michael Nichols, the equally outrageous script by her brother Frank Clarke.
But the whole thing is very Margi.
She starts off in chicken stuffer's uniform as seen in Letter To Brezhnev and ends up in designer punk bondage dress and boxing boots.
The show follows, with a lot of digression, her path from the chicken factory to celebrity.
The legend about the making of Letter To Brezhnev starts it off.
It's a good story and all the better for being more or less true.
Other tales that make up the show are obviously fictional: the stuff of stand-up comedy.
But it is quite often difficult to tell the difference between fact and fantasy.
Margi's world is a very individual one that mixes feminism, philosophy and frankness.
There are some strange flights of fancy and there are also some extremely down to earth not to say earthy observations.
A little smut, it must be said, does go a long way.
And there is a lot more than a little.
But there are some entertaining ideas there too, like a near-irreverent sequence about David Icke phoning heaven, or Margi's contemplation of her TV success with The Good Sex Guide…she imagines millions of babies being born in a few month's time all called Margi.
It's easy to forget that you are not listening to a mate in a pub telling her latest, raucous, embellished anecdotes.
Margi is a natural.
And she knows her audience.
Two mini Margis in the stalls are the target of most of the ad libs, and they respond as if they grew up with the star.
The routines play on that, looking back to Margi's life in Kirkby: poverty, religion, sex and the dole queue are all part of the equation.
And the stories are told in a language that fits, with plenty of Kirkby slang among the four-letter words.
A lot of it is quite funny, a bit is very funny, and some is slightly self-indulgent.
And, not being from Kirkby, I am still none the wiser about the meaning of the word ‘scut’.

BELLS ARE RINGING FOR SAM AND DIANE
CHEERS The final episode
Sunday, Channel 4, 9.00pm
THE LAST order bell rings tonight for
Cheers…but will there also be wedding bells ringing for Sam and Diane?
After 11 years, 175 episodes and 26 Emmy awards Boston's most famous bar is closing and it is our turn to watch this specially extended final episode.
More than 150 million Americans tuned in to watch the episode in the States last month making Cheers — which earned £200 million in worldwide sales — the most-watched TV show in history.
Over the years some famous visitors have dropped in to Cheers: Emma Thompson, Roger Reece and John Cleese, who won an Emmy for his 1987 appearance as marriage counsellor Simon Finch Royce.
The Righteous Brothers popped in for a swifty, as did Twin Peaks star Sherilyn Fenn.
Others to share a Cheers beer mat include former senator Gary Hart, Christopher Lloyd of Back to the Future and, in the final episode, Tom Berenger.
The show's makers NBC decided to scrap Cheers when Ted Danson, who plays the leading character barman Sam Malone, announced he was quitting to make more movies.
Cheers is based on a real bar in Boston — The Bull and Finch — where the cast gathered to watch the final episode.
In the final show Diane (Shelley Long) returns after a six year absence from the series to declare once and for all her love for Sam (Ted Danson).
The feeling is mutual, but is he ready to run off to California with her?
Hollywood heart-throb Tom Berenger guests as the new love in the life of Rebecca (by Kirstie Alley).
This is the night we British fans also learn whether Woody's (Woody Harrelson) political career takes off, and will find out what Norm (George Wendt) loves most in the world.
Whatever happens it's time to raise one last glass to Cheers and the end of a decade of vintage comedy.
CHEERS: The final episode sees Sammy reunited with his old sparring partner Diane!
Now for some DIY
TODAY'S Birthday Honours are the last before the do-it-yourself system comes into play for the New Year awards.
They are also the first to contain the new style ‘classless’ honours, with the end of the separate British Empire Medal for outstanding community service.
Instead, MBEs are awarded.
The main list of 917 names no longer automatically honours civil servants who reach a certain rank.
There are more awards for people who have performed charitable or voluntary work.
Golden shot
By Paul O'Brien WIRRAL's English schools champion Helen Wilding produced an encouraging performance in the TSB Merseyside Schools Athletics Championships at Bebington today.
Wilding, in the last year of her under-17 age group, had a winning shot putt of 12.42 metres.
Liverpool's Debbie Sinnott won the under-15 girls 100 metres in 12.9 seconds.
Sinnott's Liverpool team mate Pat Taylor looked good when she won her heat of the under-15 sprint hurdles in 11.7 seconds.
Fine style
Another good winning shot putt throw was that of Sefton's Brian McEveily who took the senior boys title in fine style.
His colleague at Sefton, Peter Johnson, won the senior boys javelin with a throw of 56.04 metres.
Further success for Liverpool was registered by Andrew Parkinson in the boys under-15 triple jump with 12.06 metres.
Peter Stephenson was successful in the sprint hurdles where he recorded 11.9 seconds.
DRIVER'S PRIZE RIG!
Caring Harry named ‘Top Dad’ after mercy mission
A LORRY driver who helped take aid to refugees in Croatia was yesterday named Britain's Top Dad.
Harry Pearce, 40, from Wigan, Greater Manchester, was nominated by his 12year-old daughter Alison for always putting everyone else before himself.
He was part of a mission by the Feed the Children charity which distributed £36,000 worth of food, medical supplies and clothing to Croatian refugees.
To mark the award, organised by the British Clothing Industry Association and the Guild of British Tie Makers, Mr Pearce received a new suit, shirt and tie at a London hotel.

IT'S AN HONOUR
facelift plan is unveiled
By Daily Post Correspondent
PROPOSALS for a £3m refurbishment of the Grange Shopping Centre, Birkenhead have been unveiled.
Legal and General Property have been presented their plans to the City Lands Policy Group and traders at the centre.
The first stage of the scheme is designed to improve comfort and safety.
Proposals include work on St John's Pavement, St John's Square, Borough Pavement and the approach to St Werburgh's Square, from Borough Pavement.
Protection
This will involve new paving and drainage, and canopies along each side of the mall to protect shoppers in bad weather.
New lighting, a landscaped public area in St John's Square and a safer pedestrian crossing between Borough Pavement and the market are included in the plans.
The refurbishments follow a repair programme last winter.
Susan Roche, Legal and General Property associate director, said: ‘The interest shown by shoppers, traders and the local authority is so high that we shall be mounting an exhibition of the proposals.
‘We are very keen that everyone will have a clear idea of what is involved.’
Rosy goes to court in Udinese storm
OUT-OF-CONTRACT Ronny Rosenthal opens business with Udinese this month — but he won't be signing for them, writes Ric George.
Liverpool's Israeli star will be in court to bring charges of breach of contract against the relegation threatened Italian club for an incident four years ago.
In the summer of 1989, as a Standard Liege player, Rosenthal put pen to paper on a deal with Udinese and spent two weeks there.
But the Italians claimed that the move had fallen through because the player had a back injury.
Whatever was supposed to be wrong had never hindered Rosenthal's career, and it seemed the real reason for Udinese's calling off the transfer — they signed Argentinian striker Abel Balbo instead — was the level of anti-semitism in the town.
Fists fly for fun in town pageant
Ray Kelly
A PUNCH-up right under the eyes of the law went unpunished as a town took a trip back in time.
The Prescot Playhouse Players brought the history books to life at the town's pageant this week.
And their performance was so popular with the watching crowd that there were calls for the return of the stocks.
VIP guest George Pattison, the Dean of King's College, Cambridge, won a rousing cheer at the ceremony when he told the crowd: ‘I am disappointed we cannot sentence anyone to the stocks today.
Pageant
‘That would be a popular move.’
‘You can say that again!’ came the reply from the audience.
He was representing the former Lords of the Manor at the pageant.
The Prescot Playhouse Players performed before guests including the Lord Lieutenant of Merseyside Sir Henry Cotton.
Dressed in authentic costumes, enacting the part of rogues in a street brawl, they playfully put on a display of fisticuffs to show the system of fines in the 1600s.
A push would earn a 3d fine, but the worst offence was attacking the local policeman, which earned a fine of 6s 8d, which would be doubled on a Sunday.
Street brawl…but just for laughs
Numbers game
PREMIER League players will have their names and squad numbers on their shirts next season.

Banana triumph
CHRIS LILLYWHITE held off all last-minute challenges to win the Milk Race in Manchester this afternoon.
The Banana professional team rider from Walton-on-Thames crossed the line safely tucked in the main bunch, his arms aloft, at the end of 25 laps of a two-mile city-centre circuit.
Stage victory went to Kazakhstan rider Alexandre Nadobenko, who proved strongest in a headwind sprint finish along Deansgate.
Australia's Daman McDonald took third place at the line ahead of Jerzy Sikora, of Poland, Britannia amateur team rider Ian Wright and Australia's Patrick Jonker.
Nadobenko, although a previous stage winner, had started the final stage almost seven minutes down on Lillywhite overall.
At the bell the leaders were 11 seconds clear with Ireland's Conor Henry, last year's overall rider, chasing ahead of the bunch.
As they rounded the last corner the leaders had the main field breathing down their necks.
Lillywhite retained his 20-second lead over Norway's Ole Simensen, and Czech rider Daniel Kovar was third overall.
Tickle is not laughing
By Richard Williamson
SANDHURST SHIELD holders Orrell Red Triangle were sent crashing in the first round of this year's competition in the Southport Cricket League.
Paul Hailwood (72) and Tony Foster (61) led Eccleston to a daunting 236–6 in 40 overs and despite 70 from Steve Tickle, Orrell were dismissed for 171.

Samoans have the Scots on
Western Samoa…28 Scotland…11
SCOTLAND lost their unbeaten record in the final game of their Pacific tour when they crashed 28–11 in the unofficial Test against Western Samoa in Apia.
Scotland showed superior power in the scrum but could not capitalise on their possession, and Western Samoa, who scored three tries to one, produced flowing play which was backed up by a strong play in the lineouts.
The first points came inside five minutes when Western Samoa's To'o Vaega ran through two tackles to touch down.
Scotland answered with a show of power in the scrum which lead to an 11th minute try by captain Andy Nicol.
Five minutes before the end of the first-half Danny Kaleopa scored again for the Samoans, but Greg Townsend kicked a penalty in the last minute of the half to reduce the Samoans' advantage to four points at 12–8.
Great success
Western Samoa dominated the second-half when the Scots could only add another Townsend penalty.
Scotland coach Allan Hosie said the Pacific tour had been a great success considering eight Scots were on the British Lions tour and other players were not able to make the trip.
‘Overall we are more than pleased as the aim was to bring young players on for the 1995 World Cup,’ he said.
‘We were not surprised by the result today because we have a young developing side and the Samoans played extremely well.
‘They won a lot of possession and without the ball you can't win the game.’

GRANT FOX topped 1,000 points for the All Blacks in all games, including non-Test matches, with Saturday's haul of 15 against the Lions.
Fox began his 74th game with 995 points and ended with 1110.
In his 42 Tests he has landed 588 points.
Gavin Hastings topped
Phil Bennett's overall for a Lions' scorer with his 18 points and equalled another record.
Bennett scored 44 points in eight Tests in 1974 and 1977 and Hastings has now scored 46 from only four Tests.
Hastings' six penalties matches Tony Ward's five penalties and a drop-goal in the Lions' defeat in Cape Town in 1980.
Reds new boy looks on brighter side for England
NIGEL Clough knows perhaps better than anyone how England are flirting with a losing game that can become a terminal habit.
As they try tomorrow to do against the brilliant Brazilians what was beyond them against the amateurish Americans, the Liverpool new boy is reminded of Nottingham Forest's brave battle against relegation.
It finished off his father Brian and his own connection with the Midlands club.
And now Nigel is fighting another slump that threatens Graham Taylor's fading grasp on the manager's job after four games without a win.
Good performance
He said: ‘When you're down, things don't run for you as we've had all this season at Forest.
We've had numerous games like that (against the US) when we've murdered teams, they've had one or two shots and taken all three points.
‘It can become a rut.
That's why the next match is so important we're looking for a good performance and ultimately a good result.’
Clough has waited a long time for a decent run to establish himself after more than two years as squad makeweight.
‘I have to take this chance so that come Poland in September the manager's got a difficult choice.’
He is trying to prove himself a credible alternative to the absent Paul Gascoigne, and his £2m move to Liverpool should boost his standing.
But he feels there is no reason why both cannot share roles in the same team.
Clough is confirmed in England's midfield in the RFK Stadium tomorrow, while Manchester United midfielder Paul Ince looks set to captain the side again with David Platt still injured.
Said Ince: ‘We're still confident in our own ability we believe we can put things back to rights.’
And Platt rapped back at criticism that Taylor has lost his ability to motivate his players.
He said:’ That's not fair our motivation is done by ourselves and not by the manager.
Winning
‘We could play the US again tonight, it could go along the same pattern and we would end up winning 4–2 or 5–2 because of the chances we created.’
Taylor will name his team this afternoon with Crystal Palace goalkeeper Nigel Martyn set to come in.
England (possible): Martyn (Crystal Palace); Dixon (Arsenal), Winterburn (Arsenal), Pallister (Manchester Utd), Walker (Sampdoria), Merson (Arsenal), Clough (Liverpool), Sharpe (Manchester Utd), Sheringham (Tottenham), Wright (Arsenal), Ince (Manchester Utd).
Nigel Clough…fighting another slump
King Edwards sparks Bromborough double
…and Ruddock waits in wings
John Scales…priority Neil Ruddock…excellent season with Spurs
By Ric George
GRAEME SOUNESS has made a final attempt to persuade Wimbledon to part with John Scales — and has lined up Neil Ruddock in case he fails.
The Liverpool boss has told Dons' chairman Sam Hammam that he Centre-back Scales remains Souness' priority, the Reds boss having snapped up Nottingham Forest midfielder Nigel Clough.
But there is no way he will be held to ransom over a figure which is totally unrealistic.
However, it looks likely that Liverpool will start the new campaign with a new central defender on their staff, which could prompt Sheffield Wednesday to renew their interest in Mark Wright.
Souness' patience with Wimbledon is running out, which explains his sudden links with Ruddock.
If Hammam refuses to budge on his asking price for Scales, then Spurs star Ruddock may be on his way to Anfield.
Powerful, combative and dangerous at set pieces, the rugged defender has enjoyed an excellent season after returning to White Hart Lane from Southampton for £750,000.
His first transfer to Tottenham split two spells with Millwall before he moved to the Dell, where his no-nonsense approach and disciplinary problems earned him a hard-man reputation.
Ruddock signed a three-year deal last summer, with chief executive Terry Venables promising him a new, improved five-year contract if his poor disciplinary record improved.
But even though it did in a campaign where he was one of Tottenham's top performers, Venables has been unable to keep his word because of chairman Alan Sugar's attempt to oust him from the club.
Rebel Ruddock emerged as the players' spokesman for Venables, speaking up for him in the High Court yesterday, having already slapped in a transfer request to Sugar.
It seems certain that the player will leave White Hart Lane if Venables is not re-instated after his power struggle, and Spurs would ask at least £2m for Ruddock's services.
Having turned only 25 last month, while possessing the fighting qualities which Souness admires, the Reds' chief could see him as better value than Scales — and the man to put steel into a brittle defence which cost so many points last term.
Souped-up Campbell!
By Richard Williamson
ALISTAIR CAMPBELL roared past 500 runs on Saturday and put himself firmly on course for the magical 1,000 mark.
The Zimbabwe Test batsmen started the day needing 25 against Sefton but went soaring on to post a superb 140 not out.
Campbell cracked five 6s and fourteen 4s in his 146 ball innings to lift his tally for the season to 615.
Campbell shared in a stand of 166 with Mike Hughes (45 not out) as Wallasey raced to 213–1 in 44.4 overs.
Sefton were left to fight a valiant rearguard action after losing half their batting cheaply.
Lawrence Wilson (27) and Martin Isaac (24) chipped in with useful runs, but it was a last wicket stand of 59 between Rob Houghton (39) and Stuart Wade (20 not out) that lifted Sefton to 176 all out.
Wallasey's teenage leg spinner David Miles took 5–99 and Mark Anderson 3–53.
Exciting
Ormskirk made it two wins out of three but it was a close run thing against New Brighton.
The visitors reached 166–6 after some solid batting led by John Horrocks (37 not out), Louis Botes (35) and Phil Luxon (32).
Opener Kevin Burns (49) helped Ormskirk overcome the early setback of being 15–2 with valuable runs also coming from David Birks (30) and Richard Malley (23) in the middle order.
Tim Watkins' spell of 3–23 kept the game in the balance before Gareth Finney hit the winning runs in the penultimate over with the last pair at the wicket.
Justin Rennie put an end to Neston's five match unbeaten run with a super all-round show.
First he took 7–52 as Neston struggled to 151 all out in 55 overs.
With Andrew Woolley (40) and Phil Davis (39) at the wicket the champions had reached a promising 140–4 before slumping to the young spinner.
Then he made 38 runs in good time as Northern cashed in against the champions' depleted bowling resources.
Skipper Tony Meehan made 57 and important late runs came from Tommy Reilly (26 not out).
Ormskirk leg spinner John Armstrong took 6–16, including a hat-trick, and made 34 as the Merseyside Youth Cricket under-13 side beat North Cheshire by 56 runs.
Scores: MYC 115 NCL 59.
…and it's hat-trick joy for Turner
Swift's debut delight
TWO bowlers the experienced David Turner and newcomer Ben Swift will never forget their performances in the Weightman Rutherfords Liverpool Competition on Saturday.
Turner achieved a hat-trick for the first time in the Competition in a five wicket haul for Birkenhead Park in their drawn game with St. Helens Recs.
Swift, 16, making his debut for Southport at Formby, also took five wickets as his side won comfortably by 10 wickets.
Former Park skipper Turner, who led his team to the title in the Eighties, achieved his hat-trick by bowling Morrison, having Aconley caught at slip and trapping Garvey leg before.
Recs declared at 160–8 off 49 overs, thanks mainly to a super innings from Vinny Wood, who made 89 not out which included his own ‘hat-trick’ of three successive sixes off Gareth Evans.
Park, in trouble at 10–2, recovered through a third wicket stand of 65 between Phil James and Martin Smith, who made 53.
But another slump put paid to their victory chances and an unbroken ninth wicket stand between David Smith (27 not out) and Evans (15 not out) left them on 146–8.
Young Swift stole the show with his medium pacers that had Formby on the rack.
Swift ended with fine figures of 5–16 and, aided by Shukla's spell of 4–49, the home team crashed to 95.
The total presented few problems to Southport, with Jamie Butler's unbeaten 70 and Malcolm Swift's 28 not out guiding them home in 21 overs.
Home captain Norman Owers was critical of his side after another poor batting show.
‘It was a good batting track yet we achieved our fourth score of less than one hundred this year.
We got what we deserved because we batted awfully.’
Ian Jones, who hit his highest Competition score last week of 31 against Neston, was his side's top scorer against Southport with 17.
The teams in first and second place in the table, Oxton and Chester Boughton Hall, enjoyed mixed fortunes.
Malcolm Gamet's side totalled 163–6 declared in 43 overs at Hightown.
Graham Money played superbly for 73, but the leaders' hopes of an eighth win from 10 games were frustrated, despite another superb exhibition of spin bowling by John O'Brien.
The Cheshire player took 5–32 as the home side struggled.
They needed two wickets in the final over but picked up only one as Hightown held out at 110–9.
Boughton Hall closed the gap with an eight wicket triumph at Huyton.
The home side were 8–3, but after a fourth wicket had fallen cheaply Neil Fernyough (62) and Richard Conlan (33) put together a stand of 65 for the fifth.
Fernyough hit eight 4s and three 6s, but once they were out the tail collapsed and Huyton totalled just 122.
Adrian Griffith (34) and David Wright (26) put on 45 for the first wicket, before Barry Metcalf (23 not out) and Steve Wundke (33 not out) saw Chester home.
West Indian Griffith contributed to Huyton's demise with 3–9 while Fred Beyeler (3–32) and Wundke, bowling unchanged and taking 4–61, did the rest.
RUNNERS STEP OUT FOR VICKI
By Jane Gallagher
HUNDREDS of fun runners will put their best foot forward tomorrow in memory of tragic Merseyside youngster Vicki Bayliss.
Cooler, drier weather is forecast for their effort to raise funds for research into the rare disease, neuroblastoma, which killed 14-year-old Vicki last year.
The schoolgirl had planned to become a dancer.
Her family and former schoolfriends in Crosby set up the Vicki Bayliss Neuroblastoma Research Fund in her memory and tomorrow her mother, Judy, will join the 850 runners who have applied to take part in the 11th Crosby 10.
Race organiser Dennis Gill said Vicki's fund was chosen because it touched the heart of the organisers.
He said: ‘The Crosby 10 was set up to help local charities and when we were taking suggestions for this year Vicki's name was mentioned.
‘The run is unique in Merseyside because it is aimed at the fun runner serious runners have to be prepared to take a back seat.
‘The aim of the day is fun for all the family and we have many family entrants my own five children will be joining me.’
Last year the event raised more than £6,000 and this year other local charities which stand to benefit from the run are the Sefton Resource Centre for the Physically and Mentally Handicapped and Great Crosby RC Primary School.
The fun kicks off at 12 noon tomorrow on St Mary's playing fields, Little Crosby.
Prost rules — but it's pits for Hill!
FRENCHMAN Alain Prost regained top spot in the world drivers' championship by winning the Canadian Grand Prix in Montreal and he did it in typically precise and measured style.
Prost, in a Williams, recovered from a poor start, when he was beaten off the grid by team-mate Damon Hill, to take the lead after six laps and then drive virtually faultlessly to the chequered flag.
But a disappointed Hill, who finished third, could point to a disastrous pit-stop for losing him precious time.
The win was Prost's fourth in seven races this year and enlarged his record career total of victories to 48.
German driver Michael Schumacher, in a Benetton, finished second ahead of Britain's Hill, with Austrian Gerhard Berger fourth for Ferrari.
Another Briton, Martin Brundle, driving a Ligier, finished fifth, collecting points for his team for the third time in four races, and Austrian Karl Wendlinger finished sixth in a Sauber.
Prost's victory lifted him to 47 points at the head of the drivers' championship while Brazilian Ayrton Senna, the McLaren driver who was forced to retire after running second until the closing laps, remains second in the title race with 42 points.
Prost, starting from a record seventh successive pole position at the start of a season, was beaten off the grid by Hill in a startling getaway which also saw the two Ferraris of Berger and Jean Alesi of France surge through from the third row to take third and fourth places.
Senna also made a brilliant start from eighth on the grid and was swiftly up to fifth and then fourth when he overcame Alesi in a wheel-to-wheel battle down the back section.
Senna then sliced past Berger to take third place and took second when the leading group all pulled in for pit-stops for new tyres between laps 29 and 34.
These pit-stops proved to be disastrous for Hill, whose Williams crew did not seem to be prepared and he slipped back from second to fourth as a result of his stop which lasted more than 17 seconds.
‘They did not seem to be ready for me at all,’ said Hill.
‘I have not spoken to them yet to find out what happened.’
Excitement
Prost built up a solid lead of 28 seconds before he pitted and was then able to run his own race to the chequered flag with most excitement focused on the battle for second between Senna and the surging Schumacher.
The young German eventually got in front with seven laps remaining when Senna's McLaren appeared to develop a technical problem, Schumacher squeezing past at the final hairpin.
‘We nearly touched, but not quite,’ said a delighted Schumacher afterwards.
‘This result shows we are giving Williams a tough battle now and we are pushing them hard.’

Let down
County title chase starting to hot up
Flower holds key to Widnes glory
WIDNES stepped up their challenge for the Cheshire County League championship with a comprehensive 10-wicket home victory over Stalybridge with Zimbabwe Test star Grant Flower their key man.
Stalybridge were dismissed for 112, with Flower taking 6–17, and Widnes coasted home at 113–0 (Flower 59 not out, Tim Bostock 50 not out).
Widnes lie in third place, three points behind leaders Toft who beat Urmston by 22 runs and one point behind Didsbury who won by four wickets at Cheadle Hulme.
Upton won their first game since the opening day of the season when they routed Winnington Park for 64 the season's lowest score with groundsman Alex Kegg taking 4–18 after Upton had been dismissed for a modest 128.
Alsager captain Eddie Gilhooley hit 112 in a high-scoring draw with Northwich.
Champions Macclesfield made it four wins in a row when they inflicted Bowdon's first defeat, Australian Darren Berry hammering a quickfire 94 not out.
Results: Alderley Edge 208–5 dec (S Woolcock 97, R Simpson 83) Poynton 201–9 (S Williams 75); Alsager 186–9 (E Gilhooley 112) Northwich 200–8 dec (T Higgins 65); Alvanley 154 (M Brook 5–37, Marple 172–9 dec (R Elviss 5–56); Bowdon 149 (S Blackburn 56, K Teasdale 53) Macclesfield 150–3 (D Berry 94 not out); Bramhall 177–9 Hyde 187–5 dec; Brooklands 112–7 Heaton Mersey 174–9 dec; Cheadle 149 Grappenhall 154–7; Cheadle Hulme 147–7 dec Didsbury 148–6; Upton 128 Winnington Park 64; Urmston 160 (R Locke 7–41) Toft 182–5 dec (L Challinor 57); Warrington 132 Timperley 133–6; Widnes 113–0 (G Flower 59 not out, T Bostock 50 not out) Stalybridge 112 (D Herd 51, G Flower 6–17).
WIDNES allrounder Richard Hignett plays as a batsman when Cheshire open their Minor Counties championship programme against Cornwall at Stalybridge today.
Hignett, lined up to share the new-ball bowling with Nigel Peel, had to pull out of last Sunday's MCC Trophy game with Cumberland due to a rib injury.
Although he is fit to play in the Western Division curtain-raiser today and tomorrow, it's unlikely he'll be utilised as a bowler.
Cheshire: S T Crawley (Marchwiel), T J Bostock (Widnes), I Cockbain Capt. (Bootle), J D Gray (Bowdon), J D Bean (Bootle), R G Hignett (Widnes), G Miller (Leyland), J Potts (Knypersley), J F M O'Brien (Oxton), T C M Standing (Bowdon), N D Peel (Bowdon).
Northern's star is brilliant all-round Liverpool Competition
A DAZZLING all-round performance by Justin Rennie inspired Northern to a five wicket victory over champions Neston.
Liverpool Competition captain Phil Davies (39) could not have been more impressed when he became part of the statistics in Rennie's 7–52 haul as Neston made 151 from 55 overs.
And Rennie later shone with the bat, his score of 38 in 42 balls included five fours, and together with Tony Meehan (57) showed Northern the way home from 45 overs.
Undefeated
Zimbabwe Test star Alistair Campbell reached 600 runs for the season with an undefeated century helped Wallasey to a 214-run victory over Sefton.
Campbell's 140 came off only 146 balls and included 14 fours and six sixes.
He and Mike Hughes put on 166, the latter making a useful 45no and the home side declared after 44.4 overs at 213–1.
Sefton lost five wickets cheaply, but a last wicket stand of 59 between Rob Houghton (29) and Stuart Wade (20), caused Wallasey some problems before they were all out for 176 with Wallasey's 16-year-old young leg spinner David Miles taking 5–99.
Firwood Bootle's skipper Ian Cockbain knew what he was doing on a soft unpredictable Aigburth pitch when he declared at what seemed an easy target at Liverpool.
Only the experienced Cockbain could play the unusual Aigburth wicket knocking up 79 out of 150–6.
Andy McDowell's 43 gave Liverpool a good base.
But when Mike Mannion cut loose the home side collapsed to 127 all out.
Formby suffered a crushing 10 wicket defeat at home to local rivals Southport.
Formby suffered in the face of superb bowling spells by Shukla (4–49) and 16year-old Ben Swift (5–16) and ended on 95 all out.
Southport's reply was never in any trouble and Swift (28no) and Butler (70no) were able to score at will.
Skill
Oxton just failed to pull off victory at Hightown on a rain affected wicket.
Graham Money (79) batted with great skill to allow the visitors to declare after 42 overs at 163–6.
Hightown were shackled by John O'Brien (5–36) but held out for a draw.
Neil Fearnyough and Richard Conlan stopped Huyton's rot against Chester, coming together at 22–4 to add 65 for the fifth wicket.
Fearnyhough hit 62 including three sixes and eight fours and Conlan 33.
In reply Chester scored steadily to clinch the win.
St Helens Recs reached 160–8 from 49 overs at Birkenhead Park, David Turner taking 5–43 inlcuding a hat-trick.
Park's Martin Smith and Philip James put on 65 and a partnership of 36 between David Smith and Gareth Evans kept Park in with a chance before time ran out.
Ormskirk got home against New Brighton with their last pair at the wicket.
Kevin Burns made 49 and Tim Watkins took 3–23 before Gareth Finney hit the winning runs in the penultimate over.
HOWZAT: Huyton opener Keith Jones is out lbw to Chester's Steve Wundke
Easy for Liverpool
THE Liverpool Competition cruised to a ten wicket win over the Merseyside Competition in the first round of the President's Trophy at Northern yesterday.
The visitors were all out for 83, Louis Botes taking 3–9 and Geoff Blackburn 4–7 and only Peter Mercer (19) and Malcolm Cockbain (10no) reached double figures.
Liverpool needed only 23.4 overs to claim the runs, John Hitchmough scoring 58no and Phil Davis 28no.

Cooke blasts big decisions that cost win
Lions roar with displeasure
By Terry Cooper in Christchurch
THE British Lions were today fuming over two refereeing decisions which they claimed cost them victory in the first Test against New Zealand in Christchurch.
The visitors lost 20–18 to a last-minute Grant Fox penalty which eclipsed Gavin Hastings's record-equalling 18 points.
But tour manager Geoff Cooke and his players insisted the penalty award by Australian referee Brian Kinsey was a mistake along with the decision to grant the New Zealanders a second-minute try.
Cooke said: ‘I can't understand that last minute penalty against Dean Richards.
It was a strange decision.
He said we were holding on to the ball, but we wanted it to come out.
‘The game was full of refereeing inconsistencies.’
The only try of the game came after 88 seconds when Fox hoisted a wicked kick to the goal-line.
Ieuan Evans caught the ball and then grappled with Frank Bunce for it, before both players tumbled over the line.
Lions coach Ian McGeechan said: ‘Ieuan thinks it was a 50–50 ball and he had it as well as Bunce when it was grounded.’
And television replays from behind the goal-line showed that Evans's hand NEVER left the ball.
The player said: ‘I had my hands on the ball all the time.
How can it be a try?’
But Kinsey defended his decision by insisting: ‘I got the nod from my touch judge Andy Cole.’
On the Richards decision, Kinsey explained: ‘He was preventing release of the ball.
I had given the Lions two or three penalties for the same offence.’
Hastings said: ‘It was very disappointing.
We deserved our lead and to lose in the last minute was terrible.’
The result makes it very difficult for the Lions to win the series.
They turned round a 1–0 deficit in Australia four years ago, but the All Blacks on their own turf are a different proposition from the Wallabies.
‘Still, we were only just beaten here,’ said Hastings, bitterly upset that his team had the match stolen from them when Fox landed his 47-yard penalty with only 35 seconds of normal time left.
Shaded
The Lions' successes were the back row, where the experiment of playing Ben Clarke out of position at blindside flank was a huge success.
Clarke contributed to the line-out effort, which was shaded by the All Blacks 21–17.
Stand-off Rob Andrew kicked downfield beautifully, but was hampered by the slowness of transfer of the ball in midfield under All Black pressure.
Both kickers established new landmarks.
Hastings reached 46 in his four Tests, surpassing Phil Bennett's 44 for an individual Lion, while Fox went past 1,000 points in his 74th appearance for the All Blacks.
All Blacks coach Laurie Mains said: ‘Grant is one of those players you have a lot of confidence in.
It was a typical first Test performance by us.’

Team hopes to make a splash
MEMBERS of the British team for the world human-powered submarine races were flying to Florida today.
Their two-person craft, built and designed by engineering students at Southampton University, will take part in the event off the coast of Florida from June 15 to 26.
POSTSPORT: Focus on the sailing scene
THERE was a fast passage for the crews taking part in Tranmere Sailing Club's Isle of Man midnight race from Rock Ferry to Douglas despite a calm spell as the fleet left the Mersey.
The yachts later picked up a freshening breeze which reached Force 5 approaching the island.
The Sigma 38 Panda Nova sailed by Derek Matthews from the Royal Dee Yacht Club completed the trip in just over 11 hours and was declared the winner of Class A on corrected times by an eight minutes margin ahead of Alec Rawlinson's Pellegrina.
Class B was won by Tranmere contestant Jim Gavin aboard Salamandra but it was a close call with Catch 32 owned by Jim Myerscough from Blundellsands.
The margin on corrected times was just 39 seconds.
A total of 28 yachts completed the course.
Royal Mersey Yacht Club edged out Royal Anglesey Yacht Club by a quarter point in a team race in Mylnes.
In another very close team event Wallasey just beat the Menai Straits one design club by a quarter point.
Other results: Wallasey Yacht Club Seabirds, winner Guillemot (B Cosgrove).
Royal Mersey YC Mylne Class: Merlin (M Colley).
Squibb Class: Wit's End (P Whitt).
Hoylake Sailing Club Falcon Class: Eleonora (G Chapman) and Falcon II (W Telfer).
One win each.
Opera Class: Sylvana (A Stratton) and La Boheme (M Jones).
One win each.
Fans set to make a cool £1,000
A FAN-tastic collection of antiques is set to go under the hammer in Liverpool.
Auctioneers Outhwaite and Litherland are selling the 40 antique fans, some of which date back to the beginning of the century.
And they recruited beauty queen Amanda Claire to do their own version of the fan dance.
Manager Bill McMahon, said: ‘The fans range from boas to ostrich feather to Spanish fans.
‘It is a marvellous collection and is beautifully preserved.’
Also on hand to help at the sale was Outhwaite's Colin Barker.
The fans would have come in handy during the humid weather over the last few days.
Not that you would want to wave them though, for the collection is set to raise more than £1,000.
Fan dance…
Bill, Colin and Amanda.

Ian Austin…four day claim
Second team boss John Stanworth appreciated Austin's attitude.
‘He just wanted to play cricket,’ said Stanworth, ‘and didn't mind coming straight from a full house at Leicester to a second team game at Southport.
‘That's the sort of lad he is quiet, but concerned about his performances.’
Austin replaces Mike Watkinson in Lancashire's team to face Essex tomorrow.
Watkinson is resting his broken finger.
Breezy
Lancashire's second day against Essex was washed out yesterday, but Wasim Akram's Pakistan Test colleague again hogged the headlines with his second five-wicket haul of the season as Surrey took charge against joint championship leaders Glamorgan at The Oval.
He bagged 5–60 to help shoot out the visitors for 166, a deficit of 116.
England vice-captain Alec Stewart weighed in with six catches behind the stumps as Glamorgan, with broken thumb victim Matthew Maynard, slumped to 24–5.
80 rafts in river charity fun day
A FLOTILLA of rafts sailed off down the Mersey to take part in a charity contest at the weekend.
The Merseyside Police Charity Raft Race has become one of the most popular events in the Mersey River Festival, raising tens of thousands of pounds for charity.
Over 1,000 people and 80 rafts took part in the race from Otterspool promenade to New Brighton.
The event raised £59,000 for charity last year and organisers are hoping this year's figure will top that.
The raft race was one of the final events of the 13th Mersey River Festival, which is organised annually by the Merseyside Development Corporation.
Over the past three weeks the festival has served up everything from watersports and sailing to swimming and maritime singing.
Land Ho!

Spotlight on a new look for a famous city street
£800,000 facelift nears completion
ON THE ROAD TO RECOVERY
By Jane Gallagher
THIS is the changing face of Liverpool's London Road.
The finishing touches are being put on a £800,000 new image for the once-neglected thoroughfare.
Work is expected to be completed by the beginning of September.
There will be a tree lined pedestrianised square, new public toilets, pedestrian crossings and an open space for special events.
The statue of George III styled as a Roman soldier will also be moved closer to Norton Street.
The redevelopment of Monument Buildings, which will cost £2.4m, will provide 97 student bed spaces above 16,000 sq ft of new retail units.
It is hoped that the multi-million pound facelift will reverse decades of decline for the shopping area in Liverpool city centre.
Twenty years ago London Road was a busy, thriving commercial centre thronged with shoppers.
But as shopping habits changed many traders shut up shop and moved out blaming recession, traffic restrictions and fewer bus routes.
Partnership
The result has been a high number of vacant buildings and the under-use of others.
The ambitious redevelopment project is currently being co-ordinated by the London Road Development Agency.
It is a partnership between Liverpool city council and urban renewal specialists Inner City Enterprises, funded by City Challenge cash.
A spokeswoman from London Road Development Agency said: ‘In three or four years time London Road should be a thriving shopping area with a new student population.
‘We are hoping to attract smaller retail units and discount stores building on the success of TJ Hughes.’
She added that the new National Express coach station to be built on a site bounded by Norton Street, Fraser Street and Islington will also be a bonus for the area.
London Road has enjoyed a chequered history.
Highway
It became infamous as the site of the Gallows Mills where four prisoners were hung in chains after the Jacobite rebellion in 1715.
In 1760 it was completed as a highway proper, and soon became well-known for the number of its pubs 18 in all.
In the 18th century the Lime Street end was the site of Folly Fair held every Easter Monday and Tuesday.
In its heyday it was so popular long queues built up outside its shops.
But as the recession bit and shopping habits changed, many traders were forced out of business.
Artist's impression
…what the new, improved London road should soon look like Urban decay…the recession hit certain sections of the once-thriving street very hard

Polo hitch as Prince pulls up in pain
THE Prince of Wales left the polo field clutching his back in pain yesterday after suffering a recurrence of an old problem.
He was playing in a match at Windsor Great Park when, after stretching for a ball, he was seen to wince before going to the side of the field to lie down.
His spokesman, Dickie Arbiter, said: ‘This is a recurrence of the Prince's back problem.
‘He is not badly injured he can walk but obviously, as with all back problems, it hurts a good deal.’
Acute back pain forced the Prince to give up polo for a month in June, 1991.
He was advised by doctors Continued on Page 3 Continued from Page 1 that a degenerative disc might need surgery if he did not take complete rest.
Spectators said the Prince, playing for his Maple Leafs team at the Guards' Polo Club at Smith's Lawn in Windsor Great Park, seemed to wrench his back during the middle of the second chukka of the game.
One said: ‘He was going for the ball and then he winced in pain.
He went over to the pony lines and dismounted, clutching his back.
‘He was obviously in some pain.’
Mr Arbiter said ‘the wrong movement’ of the Prince in the saddle had aggravated the old injury.
The Prince, walking slowly and painfully, later attended the polo awards ceremony.
Celebrities among the 2,000 fans who saw the Maple Leafs win a 6–5 victory included actresses Susan George, Fiona Fullerton, Patricia Hodge and Cherie Lunghi, and society hostess Ivana Trump.

LORI MCNEIL added the DFS Classic to her list of titles when she beat friend and fellow American Zina Garrison 6–4 2–6 6–3 in a patchy final at Edgbaston yesterday.
There were few moments to excite the crowd and the only note of controversy came in the second set when McNeil received a warning for slamming the ball out of court as she trailed 3–1.
Meanwhile, Garrison's row with Pam Shriver whom she accused of ‘racist’ comments during their match on Saturday remains unresolved, with the American still undecided whether or not to resign from the WTA board of directors.
Tears of frustration
GAVIN HASTINGS, captain of the shattered British Isles team, admitted that tears were shed in the dressing room after the last-minute First Test defeat by New Zealand.
The Lions believe they were robbed by first and last-minute decisions from Australian referee Brian Kinsey which gifted New Zealand eight points in a cliffhanging match.
Grant Fox, the All Blacks' supreme kicker, landed the winning kick, under great stress, from 47 yards, cancelling out the 18-point effort by captain Hastings.
‘Big match’
Hastings, who produced a magnificent kicking effort, said: ‘One or two tears were shed afterwards.
It was a very big match for a lot of players.
‘The early try did not cost us the game, but the late penalty certainly did lose it for us.’
Referee Kinsey, from Australia, who had an erratic view of events, knifed the Lions in the 88th second of the match and then with 35 seconds of normal time to go when a harsh decision on Dean Richards allowed Fox to kick the winning penalty.
New Zealand's try by Frank Bunce will remain a matter of dispute.
Fox delivered an angled kick caught by Ieuan Evans, who was instantly wrapped up by Bunce.
The pair fell over the Lions' goal line with four arms wrapped round the ball and there was a moment when Bunce had more contact on the ball.
But Evans said: ‘I never took my hands off the ball.
How could it be a try?’
After Bunce's try the game developed into a kicking contest between Fox and Hastings.
The Lions led three times, but the Bunce try was complemented by five Fox penalties.
The Lions were delighted with the choice of Ben Clarke on the blind-side of the scrum.
Clarke has not played in that position for the last couple of years, but performed excellently.
The Bath No 8 was asked to perform at openside flank before being switched to the tight side of the scrum.
Clarke won plenty of line-out ball, but Andy Reed and Paul Burnell in the front five did not contribute as expected.
Under the stress of the All Blacks' tackling Dewi Morris' passing let the Lions down at the base of the scrum and his problems were transmitted to the other midfield backs.
Hastings landed six goals from eight attempts and his sixth success put the Lions 18–17 ahead only for Fox to reply typically.
Cooke blasts referee as All Blacks escape
Lions in a rage
BRITISH LIONS tour manager Geoff Cooke continued his savage criticism of southern hemisphere referees after the first-Test defeat by New Zealand in Christchurch on Saturday.
Cooke's anger came when Australian referee Brian Kinsey awarded the All Blacks a match-winning penalty against Dean Richards in the dying seconds of a gruelling encounter, and he said: ‘The tackled-ball situation is being refereed very badly over here.’
‘Richards got the tackle on Bunce and it was either a penalty for us, or a scrum with a turnover to the Lions.
I was disappointed with the decision.’
Kinsey's verdict turned a potential Lions win into an All Blacks victory.
‘It is inconceivable that such a situation should produce a penalty against us,’ added Cooke.
Grant Fox kicked the all-important goal and the Lions went 1–0 down in the three match series.
‘Can't complain’
The Lions called the second-minute try by Bunce ‘a split decision’ and Cooke said: ‘We can't complain about that.
If we had been the attacking team we would have been wanting that try.’
The Lions must get their act together on Wednesday in New Plymouth when they play Taranaki.
Martin Johnson and Vinny Cunningham will play their first matches of the tour after flying out last week as replacements.
Cunningham is here as a deputy for Scott Hastings.
But Johnson is a live candidate to play in a Test match at Wellington or Auckland.
French rugby union captain Jean-Francois Tordo has been forced out of the tour of South Africa with a severe facial injury.
Tordo needed 20 stitches in the wound and spent the night in hospital after being caught by prop Gary Pagel's studs at the bottom of a maul during the second match of the tour against Western Province on Saturday.
Tordo may require plastic surgery.

Pwllheli made 91–3 (Williams 28no, Maurice Granger 22).
Unbeaten leaders maintain top form
UNBEATEN leaders Llanidloes marched on in Division Three of the Furrows Shropshire League while all their rivals were foiled by the weather.
Llanidloes beat the rain and a determined Cound side by four wickets to move clear at the top of the table.
But they were facing defeat at one stage, slumping to 55–6 in reply to Cound's 129–4 with spinners Pete Wise and Mike Jones taking two wickets each.
Skipper Dave Williams came to the rescue with 50 not out and featured in an unbroken seventh wicket stand of 75 with Simon Moorcroft (21 not out) to see their side home with five overs left.
Cound quick Bowler Andy Parry had put Llanidloes's unbeaten record under threat with 5–58.
Second-placed Much Wenlock lost ground after their home clash with Cae Glas was called off, while title rivals Welshpool and Montgomery were also beaten by the weather.
Spinner
A 20-over game was abandoned with Welshpool 37 without loss in six overs.
Newtown off-spinner Keith Harding set up his side's victory over Acton Reynald in Division Two, grabbing 7–41 in 22 overs to restrict the visitors to 91–9 in a game interrupted by rain.
But Newtown's mopping up efforts paid dividends when they raced to a seven wicket victory in 21 overs, Gwilym Lewis leading the charge with an unbeaten half-century and skipper Bryan Jones hitting 22.
Oswestry's First Division game against Shrewsbury was limited to five deliveries after they had put the visitors into bat.

Father and son give Aberystwyth control
A SECOND-wicket stand of 139 in 25 overs between Robin Varley and son Andy put Aberystwyth in control against Talybont.
Robin hit 74, including three sixes, and Andy 61 before falling to Richie Jenkins (3–32).
Ashad Malik (2–33) and Simon Lloyd Williams (2–40) put the brakes on as Aberystwyth reached 213–7.

‘Not insensitive’
John Durham
GRAEME HICK carved out another milestone in his career when during Worcestershire's match against Leicestershire at New Road he became the youngest player to register 20,000 runs in first-class cricket.
Hick reached the figure at the age of 27 years and 20 days to beat the previous record of 28 years and 13 days achieved by Wally Hammond in July 1931.
Hick had to wait 48 hours to chalk up the final six runs to complete the milestone after reaching 82 not out on Thursday.
Persistent rain prevented a resumption until 5pm on Saturday and a single by Hick off Winston Benjamin took him to the 20,000 mark.
By the close Hick was unbeaten on 104 the 70th first class century of his career as Worcestershire reached 207–6 off 75 overs.
England spinner Peter Such warmed up for next week's second Test with an impressive spell as Essex put pressure on Lancashire at Old Trafford.
Such grabbed two wickets in Lancashire's second innings to justify a bold declaration by Graham Gooch.
Gooch declared on 304 for six, 17 runs behind Lancashire's first innings total just before tea in an attempt to make up for time lost because of Friday's wash-out.
The England captain hit 66, nightwatchman Mike Garnham hung around to make 45 and Derek Pringle was unbeaten on 65.
At the close, Lancashire were 129 for three.
Martin Bicknell turned in a fine all-round performance to leave Surrey in charge against Glamorgan at The Oval.
The
England A paceman hit his second half-century in successive matches and snapped up two wickets before bad light and rain ended play early.
By then Glamorgan were in a mess at 16–3 having been set 427 to win.
Surrey declared their second innings on 310–6 with Bicknell hitting an unbeaten 53 after brother Darren had earlier scored 87.
Paul Parker's second century of the season brightened another gloomy day for Durham against Middlesex at Gateshead Fell.
After almost two days had been lost to rain, only 85 minutes play was possible as Durham took their overnight 185–7 to 234 all out, with Parker making 109.
Middlesex forfeited their first innings and Durham were 11 without loss in their second innings when bad light ended play.
Bad weather prevented any play on Saturday in the matches at Chesterfield (Derbyshire v Yorkshire), at Basingstoke (Hampshire v Kent) and at Hove (Sussex v Northamptonshire).
Desperate England fan Foster flames
ENGLAND are banking on their very own ‘Mr Angry’ to breathe some fire back into their Ashes attack.
Neil Foster faces a hefty fine from Essex today following his hot-tempered, stump-kicking antics during the current round of championship matches.
But on Thursday he will be given the chance to resurrect an international career which looked dead and buried, and urged to start knocking over Australian wickets in more orthodox fashion!
Gamble
Foster's recall for the second Cornhill Test at Lord's not only represents a major gamble, however, but also underlines a desperate shortage of fit and in-form pace candidates.
Now 31, Foster is fortunate to be playing cricket at all after several knee operations, the most recent of which forced him to miss a slice of last season and the start of The possibility of his breaking down at any time cannot be ignored and neither can his undistinguished international record at Lord's.
In seven Tests at headquarters between 1983 and 1989, Foster took just 14 wickets at 44 runs apiece.
Six of those victims were claimed during the match against Australia four years ago, shortly before he signed up with Mike Gatting's ‘rebels’ and sentenced himself to a ban which was only lifted last autumn.
Most batsmen would agree, though, that Foster remains a class act even if 12 first-class wickets this season have cost 49 runs each.
‘By common consent his figures are by no means a reflection on the way he is bowling,’ said chairman of selectors Ted Dexter.
Foster said: ‘It's a surprise because I am fully aware that I have not taken many wickets, although I also feel I have been bowling well.
‘The state of my knee was an obvious concern to the selectors.
But I have stayed on the park for every day in our championship matches this season and I am confident I can last the full five days of the Test.
‘This is a new chance for me but I can't say yet that it's the beginning of something long term.
I need to be successful early on.
It was frustration which sparked Foster's amazing reaction at Old Trafford last Thursday.
While such behaviour cannot be condoned, an occasional show of controlled passion from England's bowlers would not have gone amiss on the same ground when Australia were winning the first Test.
Baffled
Having decided to leave out Phillip DeFreitas for the 15th time in a start-stop career, Dexter and Co had precious few alternatives to consider.
Devon Malcolm must have been an option, but other candidates like Alan Igglesden, Martin McCague, Dominic Cork and Phil Newport were discounted by injury while Paul Jarvis has yet to rediscover top form.
The selectors could also have changed their top order, but decided to give them all another chance.
That will disappoint David Gower fans and baffle those critics who believe any lefthander would be worth his weight in gold against leg-spinner Shane Warne.
‘We were not insensitive to the clamour for batting changes, and particularly for a left-hander, but we resisted the calls,’ said Dexter.
‘It is by no means clear how it would be easier for a lefthander to score runs against leg-spin with the ball pitching in other bowlers’ footmarks.’
While the selectors have made just one change this time, it seems certain several heads will roll if Australia go two up at Lord's.
According to Dexter, ‘much time was spent on a detailed review of the Old Trafford Test and disappointment was expressed at some elements of England's performance.
‘These observations will be made clear to the team and to individual players before the game at Lord's.’
KNEES-UP…
But will Foster last the pace?
Super Steve's in seventh heaven!
Report by MIKE McEVOY
MARCHWIEL skipper Steve Crawley answered Mold's claim to possess the finest attack in the Commercial Union competition in emphatic style.
He snapped up 7–38 to send Mold crashing to 95 all out and so lift the defending champions seven points clear at the top of the table.
Crawley's killer haul polished off Mold in the 44th over despite a defiant 30 from Simon Jones and 21 from wicket keeper Brian Williams.
Below par
Earlier former Wales international David Jones rolled back the years with a top score 61, riding his luck after being dropped three times.
Jones' tally lifted Marchwiel to 143–7, Nick Brown adding 31 on a day when Mold's fielding was below par leaving them with 11 points to Marchwiel's 30.
Deposed leaders Bangor rekindled their challenge with a five wicket win over Ruthin to keep Marchwiel in their sights.
Ruthin struggled to post 107–9, the biggest single contribution of 16 coming in extras.
Dave Morpfee again impressed as he bagged 3–33 to set up Bangor for a response of 111–5, Hefin Lewis, Andy Savage and John Parry all scoring 23 as Ruthin's John James pocketed 4–29.
Prestatyn saw their title ambitions mauled by a bleak home defeat at the hands of St Asaph.
Prestatyn had to rely on Nick Bradley 31 and skipper Chris Young and Mike Williams 14 each to get them up to an inadequate 84.
Flintshire captain Gareth Ryan snapped up 4–24 and his county partner Keith Madeley 3–15, paving the way for St Asaph to collect a six wicket win and claim maximum points.
First win
Northop Hall set Mochdre a tough test, reaching 181–7, after being put in on their own track and i reply Mochdre could only muster 136–7.
Buckley earned their first win of the season scoring 175–2 as bottom of the table Wrexham slumped to their eighth defeat in eight games only managing 80–5.
Brymbo and Colwyn Bay didn't get a knock of any sort, their game being washed out after the torrential rain with both sides netting 10 consolation points.
In the 2nd XI section Marchwiel's 205–3 against Mold took them top above champions Northop Hall.
DESTRUCTIVE: Steve Crawley
Gallagher's scope for the future
David Bassett
REVOLUTIONARY new surgery has put a second Runcorn player on the road to an early return to action.
Central defender Mick Gallagher underwent scope surgery on the snapped cruciate ligament in his knee a fortnight ago, and Canal Street physio Jimmy Graham said today: ‘He could be back in action in late September or October.’
Gallagher, who was injured in February and was originally expected to be sidelined for up to a year, follows striker Nigel Shaw as a beneficiary of the new operation, which involves the small insertion of laser equipment in the side of the knee to minimise surgery.
Shaw was facing the prospect of having to retire from football, after he suffered a serious cruciate injury in only his second game for Conference side Runcorn at the beginning of last season.
But he underwent surgery in the middle of February and after a problem-free rehabilitation spell is expected to join pre-season training.
‘It is a new lease of life for Nigel, and he is raring to go,’ said Graham.
Gallagher's speedy recovery has delighted Graham.
‘You wouldn't think he had done anywhere near as much damage to the knee,’ he said.
‘The stitches are out and he is not even having to use crutches.
‘There is obviously long-term rehabilitation for Mick, but he is on the way back.’
A racing certainty
A HUMBLE £28-a-day flagman bears the main responsibility for the shambles that should have been this year's Aintree Grand National, according to the official inquiry into ‘The race that never was.’
It comes as no surprise that such a verdict should have been arrived at.
For it was the procedures and practices that have been at the very core of racing tradition for generations that were on trial here, and there was little realistic chance that they should have been found wanting.
For, in truth, humble flagman Ken Evans and race starter Captain Keith Brown both with years of successful racing experience behind them were carrying out their duties according to the book, as they and others like them have done without criticism in the past.
Mr Evans came under attack in yesterday's report of the official Jockey Club inquiry for standing too close to the starting line, and thus being primarily concerned with escaping the thunder of dozens of pairs of hooves for his own safety, rather than waving his flag.
But was it not a position that he had found ideal in his 10 years as a recall man?
And, if he had moved any farther down the course, would he still have had a clear view of Captain Brown waving his flag to signal a false start?
Safeguards Later on today, senior Jockey Club stewards meet to decide whether disciplinary proceedings are necessary, in the wake of Mr Justice Connell's Grand National inquiry.
But when his report admits that everything that could have gone wrong on that fateful day actually did, it would surely be wrong to single out any individual as a scapegoat, amid such an horrendous combination of factors.
Rather, in these days when computers are capable of most things, and electronic safeguards have become commonplace in even the steadfastly-traditional confines of Wimbledon, the Jockey Club's time would be better spent discussing innovations that would make the 1994 Grand National, and all its successors, worthy of the event.
All eyes will be on Aintree next year, and all those involved with the course must ensure that Aintree is ready.
The Grand National, after 154 years, is one of the greatest sporting spectacles in history.
With a little thought, it could surely become one of the greatest events of modern times, too…

Andrew Puddle, the Wales skipper from Colwyn Bay, won the toss and decided to field in dull conditions.
However, Dorset took a firm grip declaring at 202–3 in 54.3 overs.
An unbeaten fourth wicket stand of 133 between captain and wicket keeper Giles Reynolds (not out 81) and Alan Willows (not out 58) ruined Wales' chances of a good day.
Wales, largely batting without a great deal of distinction, were all out for 129 in 54.1 overs, trailing by 73 runs on the first innings.
At close of play Dorset were 33–1, an overall lead of 106 runs.
Lillywhite
CHRIS Lillywhite was the toast as Britain's Banana professional team celebrated their third Milk Race win in four years.
But, despite a growing public awareness, with huge crowds for the round-Britain event at most of the stage finishes, the Manchester city-centre leg which sealed Lillywhite's win could have brought the curtain down on Britain's best-known cycle race.
‘It will be devastating if the Milk Race is not here next year,’ said Lillywhite after holding on to his 20 seconds lead over Norway's Ole Simensen.
‘Everybody has heard of the Milk Race.
It's a great event and I hope it continues.
The amateur side of racing, in particular, would go downhill if riders did not have the Milk Race to aim for.’
Supporting
The 36th annual event was the last before the Milk Marketing Board disappears in its present form, although an announcement is expected before the end of this month on what involvement, if any, their successors, Milk Marque, will retain in Britain's national tour.
Lillywhite, 26, from Walton-on-Thames, has previously won the King of the Mountains title but played a supporting role when Shane Sutton (1990) and Chris Walker (1991) won the event.
‘It feels great to win at my seventh attempt,’ he added.
‘The team has done everything I asked of them.
‘The tactical decision by our manager, Keith Lambert, to lose the yellow jersey in the middle of the race, which took the pressure off us, worked perfectly.’
It was the tightest Milk Race on record.
Although Bill Nickson's five-second margin in 1976 remains the closest between first and second riders, the top 10 at the end of a race, which covered 1,154 miles in two weeks, have never been so closely packed.
Lillywhite won in a record average speed.
The final 50-mile dash around the streets of Manchester was run off at 29.9mph, bringing the race average to 26.97mph, threequarters of a mile per hour faster than the previous record, set by Joey McLoughlin in 1986.
Post sport: On a thrilling climax to the Honda Open
Torrance the Hamburg hero — but it's ‘too much too late’
SAM Torrance sank a 30-foot birdie putt to win a four-way play-off at the Honda Open in Hamburg yesterday and grabbed his fourth tournament victory in 12 weeks.
The 39-year-old Scot, despite having to contend with hay fever and a heavy cold, kept Ian Woosnam, Paul Broadhurst and Johan Rystrom at bay to move up to sixth place in the Ryder Cup points list.
Torrance won at the first extra hole, the 450-yards 18th, to collect £83,330 in prize money and go top of the European Money List.
Earlier this year he won the Kronenbourg Open in Italy and the Heineken Open in Barcelona, both European Tour events, and also carried off the Scottish championship.
Yet despite his victories, Torrance is not eligible to play in the US Open next week, nor is he exempt for next month's British Open at Sandwich.
‘My problem is I've won too much too late,’ said Torrance.
‘I'm not bitter though I cannot understand why I'm not rated in the top 50 in the world.
But if I have to qualify for the Open, I'll qualify.
‘My biggest ambition is to make the Ryder Cup team for the seventh time in a row and I'm going to make it.’
The Scot started the final round leading Rystrom by one shot and Woosnam by two, with Broadhurst a further three shots adrift.
He three-putted both the fourth and 12th holes, had only two birdies on his card, and came to the last hole needing a four for a 73 for a ten under par total of 278.
Broadhurst, who shot 68, and Woosnam, 71, were already in the clubhouse on that mark when Rystrom and Torrance, the last pair, came up the final fairway.
Boldly
Rystrom was leading the field by a shot at 11 under and needed a par four for his first European Tour victory.
But the Swede finished with a bogey five to allow Torrance, who parred the hole, Woosnam and Broadhurst to force a play-off.
At the first extra hole Torrance and Woosnam both hit the green in two but Rystrom missed the green and Broadhurst was bunkered with his second shot.
Woosnam went boldly for the pin from 35 feet but sailed six feet past before Torrance rammed home his 30-footer, leaving his three rivals to pick up their balls and share second spot.
Heswall's Paul Affleck, who shot a 67 to share second place with Woosnam and Ian Palmer, of South Africa, after the first round, ended the tournament on 289 after a final-round 73.
SAM TORRANCE
LINFORD Christie flew out to Lanzarote yesterday for a spell of sunshine training, cheered by a rapid return to winning ways at Crystal Palace.
He also launched a cheeky broadside at England's footballers and cricketers.
The Olympic 100 metres champion dispelled self doubts about his European Cup place with a pacey 10.26sec victory in chilly conditions at the British Championships on Saturday.
‘It's one of the fastest times I can remember for so early in the season,’ said Christie.
‘I'm still ring rusty but a couple of weeks’ hard work before the European Cup should see me all right.’
Christie, who ran dismally over 200 metres in Rome three days earlier, missed six weeks of pre-season training with a back injury and wants to pay particular attention to his starting technique.
He realises it needs attention if he is to complete a full set of major titles by winning the world crown in Stuttgart in August.
He promises to continue speaking his mind to try to raise the profile of athletics a sport he believes should rank alongside soccer and cricket.
Christie accused
England's struggling teams of being unfit and lacking pride in their performance, insisting: ‘Unlike them, we actually win things.
‘There are no Gazzas in our team.
Even our shot putters are in better shape than he is.’
Robb roars in Nick double
BRITAIN'S Nick Gillingham was on top of the world last night after completing a superb double in the 100 and 200 metres breaststroke in the Mycil ASA National Championships at Sheffield.
A notable absentee from this year's world top 20 breaststroke rankings, the double Olympic medallist's time in the 200 metres final of 2mins 11.56secs was the quickest in the world this year by 3.26 seconds, and only 0.33 outside Norbert Rozsa's European record.
It completed a marvellous weekend for Gillingham, who yesterday took the 100 metres in 1 min 2.16 secs0.18 inside the previous world best this year.

The Walsall 26-year-old, whose gold medal hopes in last year's Olympics were ruined by a groin injury, has had little racing since Barcelona.
But a recent six weeks of intensive training in Australia helped to regain his sharpness, and he must now be rated as a double gold medal candidate for the European Championships, also in Sheffield, this summer.
But he said: ‘Everybody will be saying ‘Ah, two gold medals’ again, but you can't predict that sort of thing.’
Clouds lift for Hagley in fell win
Gareth Hughes
LOW cloud caused problems for some of the runners in the 11.5-mile Carneddau mountain race but Kevin Hagley's navigational skills stood him in good stead.
Hagley led to the summit of Carnedd Dafydd, reaching it in 47 minutes 30 seconds, and he never once surrendered his lead despite a spirited challenge from Paul Jenkinson, who was running his first fell race.
Hagley finished 12 seconds outside Emlyn Roberts' course record but one record did fall, with Don Williams, who came fifth overall, taking a minute off the previous best for in the over-50 class.

South African Lisa in North Wales Open romp
Low hits the heights
PONY-TAILED South African No.3 Lisa Low coasted to victory in her first appearance at the North Wales Open Tennis Championships at Prestatyn with a crushing performance against 16-years-old Mold schoolgirl Claire Bennett in the final.
Top seed Low, 21, a surprise entry from Cape Town, romped home 6–1, 6–0 against the talented Welsh junior champion who broke off from her GCSE exams to compete.
The South African, once ranked in the world's top 300, decided to enter when she found herself in the north west for a three-months summer stay with her boyfriend's family in Bolton, but was never seriously tested as Benmnett fell to her second consecutive defeat in the final.
The men's crown went to Simon Ainley, professional coach at the North Wales Tennis Centre in Wrexham, who upset the form-book by defeating top seed Peter Creffield of Shrewsbury in straight sets in the final.
Beaten 6–3, 6–3 in their previous encounter, 6ft 5ins tall Ainley, a former Hampshire County choice, avenged himself with a superb display to take the title at the fourth attempt with a 6–2, 6–1 win.
Claire Bennett and Welsh international Vicki Broadbent of Mold, teamed up to lift the women's doubles crown, beating Claire Bullen Evans of Prestatyn and Nicola Jones of St Asaph 6–3, 7–5.
Final results:-Men's singles: Simon Ainley (Wrexham) bt Peter Creffield (Shrewsbury) 6–2, 6–1.
Womens singles: Lisa Lowe (Cape Town) bt Claire Bennett (Mold) 6–1, 6–0.

It's a Stich up!
Michael fires a Wimbledon warning shot
MICHAEL STICH exploded a warning shot over his Wimbledon rivals yesterday as he stormed to a crushing victory in the Stella Artois Championships at Queen's Club.
The German star routed defending champion Wayne Ferreira of South Africa 6–3, 6–4 in 56 minutes the fastest final since John McEnroe took four minutes longer to dispose of Kim Warwick in 1980.
Even quicker
Stich, £55,000 the richer for his whirlwind effort, showed no charity to his great friend and doubles partner in a one-sided contest.
And he could have been back in the locker room even quicker had he served out for the match when he led 5–2 in the second set.
But Ferreira, who had not come close to breaking the sixth seed, suddenly discovered his best form, hitting three glorious forehands, including one to save match point, and capturing the game when Stich hit a backhand volley out.
However, Stich made no mistake serving for victory second time around, sending down two aces including one on match point to take his tally to seven.
The world number nine agreed that his success was the ideal Wimbledon tonic, noting: ‘What could be better than winning the tournament?
This is the best preparation in terms of motivation and self-confidence.’
Poor spectacle
But the new Queen's champion admitted that the first meeting ever between the two players dominated by heavy serves and containing few spectacular winners was a poor spectacle for a 6,000 crowd which included Princess Diana.
‘It was not a good match.
Wayne never found his rhythm on his serve and he did not get into the match until he broke me at 5–3, but I did good enough to win,’ said the 24-year-old 1991 Wimbledon champion.
‘I think the weather took its toll today.
It was hotter than the last couple of days and there was a totally different bounce.’
Stich, who defeated compatriot Boris Becker in the quarter-finals and watched as other Wimbledon favourites Pete Sampras, Stefan Edberg and Goran Ivanisevic fell by the wayside, is now the form horse going into Wimbledon.
‘So quickly’
But he warned: ‘You don't want to win this as much as Wimbledon,’ he said.
‘Guys like Stefan and Boris will be more pumped up for that than for a preparation tournament.’
Ferreira said: ‘It happened so quickly, by the end of the first set I felt I hadn't even played one game.
‘I was playing better at the end and if it had been a five set match I think I could have fought back.’
Stich and Ferreira failed in their bid to take the doubles title when they lost their quarter-final, suspended from last night, 5–7, 6–4, 6–3 to Australian top seeds Todd Woodbridge and Mark Woodforde.
WUNDERBAR!:

Agassi set
WIMBLEDON champion Andre Agassi is set to make his tournament comeback in Germany tomorrow after eight weeks out of action through a wrist tendon injury.
Agassi withdrew last Friday from the grass court event in Halle, but yesterday he took the last remaining wild card reserved for him by tournament organisers hopeful he would be fit to play.
His first match since April, when he lost to Sergi Bruguera in Barcelona, will be against German Carl-Uwe Steeb, world ranked 59.
World number 13 Agassi, fourth seed at Halle behind Andrei Medvedev, Petr Korda and Michael Chang, is expected to fly into Frankfurt this morning before practising at Hanover.
Fears that Steffi Graf's foot injury was worse than first thought, were allayed after the defending women's champion put in six hours of practice at Wimbledon on Saturday then practised for two hours yesterday at a club in west London.
Lawmen plan Blue Knights mass ride
THE Blue Knights motorcycle club, made up of law enforcement officers, will hold an international rally at Llangollen next month.
More than 120 members, serving or retired policemen, customs officers and prison officers, from all over the UK, Germany, Switzerland, France and Luxembourg will stay at the Welsh town's youth hostel from July 16 to 18.
The climax of the weekend will be a massed ride from the hostel to Trevor basin where a cheque for about £500 collected during the rally will be presented to the Vale of Llangollen Canal Boat Trust.
Striding out for charity FIVE unemployed people who have been given a place on a training scheme at British Aerospace Airbus, Broughton, have decided to give something back to the community by a sponsored walk from Bangor to BAe Broughton over two days starting on June 24.
All money raised will go to the special baby care unit at Wrexham Maelor Hospital.
Fete opening

DAVID BYAS repaid his promotion by lifting Yorkshire up the Sunday League table at Chesterfield.
Byas, opening for the first time this season in any competition, hit his first century in one day cricket as Yorkshire cruised to a nine-wicket win over Derbyshire with 39 balls to spare.
He also shared in a Yorkshire record Sunday stand against Derbyshire, adding 165 with skipper Martyn Moxon to beat the partnership of 146 between Bill Athey and Jim Love at Chesterfield in 1979.
Moxon and Byas took advantage of some mediocre bowling to score at five an over and lay the foundations for Yorkshire's first limited overs score of more than 200 this season.
Moxon was eventually caught behind for 80 off Allan Warner.
Sunday fare not on Lancs menu
Report by SIMON WILSON
LANCASHIRE crashed to a 60-run defeat at home to Essex yesterday but it could be a blessing in disguise.
The defeat virtually rules out any chance of the Sunday League title, with just one win from their first five matches.
But skipper Neil Fairbrother's top priority this season is the championship, and with Lancashire already in the Benson & Hedges Cup final, a successful Sunday League run could have proved one distraction too many.
Lancashire were beaten by three men named in the England squad for Lord's although Essex's star man, John Stephenson, is currently out of favour with the selectors.
England skipper Graham Gooch, batting at No 5 after a lengthy selection meeting in Manchester on Saturday night, hit 67 to win over an Old Trafford crowd angry at the Test exclusion of Phil De Freitas.
In the Lancashire reply offspinner Peter Such took 4–38, ripping the heart out of the innings with the scalps of Mike Atherton, Graham Lloyd, Wasim Akram and De Freitas.
And left-arm paceman Mark Ilott grabbed 2–8 in 6.5 accurate overs.
But the biggest all-round contribution came from opener Stephenson, who shared in the match-winning stand of 116 in 24 overs with Gooch, and went on to reach 93.
Brilliant
Then he took a brilliant catch at deep square lag to dismiss Lancashire dangerman Lloyd, and grabbed two wickets with his medium pace for good measure.
Lancashire's batting performance was a bitter disappointment after their four seamers reduced Essex to 222 all out.
There were two wickets each for De Freitas and Ian Austin, Peter Martin took 3–52 and Wasim ripped through the Essex tail as they collapsed from 172–3.
But only Atherton and Lloyd looked capable of challenging the Essex total, and Lancashire's cause wasn't helped when Fairbrother ran himself out for 15.

Mersey ace sets up Rome strike
Robb roars in
CURTIS ROBB stormed home for Liverpool's only gold at the Pearl British Athletics Championships at Crystal Palace.
The Olympic 800 metres finalist moved back up to the 1500 metres where he first made his name as a junior and led from gun to tape to win in 3 mins 39.58 secs.
The time was a new personal best, his second of the championships after he had clocked 3m 43.14s in his heat itself more than four seconds off his previous-best mark.
Robb left former UK champion Simon Fairbrother trailing in his wake after a furious sprint for the line and the 21year-old medical student confirmed his fitness for a summer of racing on the European athletics circuit.
Main ambitions
After initial doubts about whether he would accept selection to run for Britain in the European Cup in Rome in two weeks' time, Robb said he would now ‘probably go if they asked me.’
‘I had a lot more left at the end,’ he added, ‘and I can take several seconds off my time in a fast race in Rome.’
Robb put down his so-called sluggishness to over-exuberant birthday celebrations.
‘I was 21 last Monday and I had a bit too much to drink,’ he smiled later.
‘I think I was probably suffering today.’
However, his main ambitions still lie over two laps.
He takes on Kenya's former Olympic champion Paul Ereng in Hengelo, Holland, next Sunday and expects a hard race as part of his preparations for the World Championships in Stuttgart at the end of August.
Behind Robb in the 1500 metres was his Liverpool Harriers club-mate Lee Cadwallader, who finished seventh in 3m 47.29s.
In the final Cadwallader struggled to stay in touch with the top class domestic field but he exceeded all expectations by taking more than four seconds off his best time when he ran 3m 44.04s in Saturday's heats.
Paul Walker added to the Harriers' middle-distance medal tally by grabbing the bronze in the 800 metres.
Like his former training partner Robb, 19-year-old Walker twice improved his personal best over the weekend.
He ran 1m 49.87s on Saturday and improved by more than two seconds in the heat of final competition to make the medal podium in 1m 47.53s in a race won by Yorkshire's Martin Steele.
The British selectors were given a few tricky European Cup choice problems at Crystal Palace.
Embarrassed
Dalton Grant gave them a headache by beating Liverpudlian favourite Steve Smith in the high jump, 2.25m to a dismal 2.05m.
Afterwards, both men claimed they should be given the place in Rome though Smith admitted to being ‘embarrassed’ by his effort.
Smith, the highest jumper in the world last year, was expected to be a certainty for gold at Crystal Palace.
The expectations were particularly high after he went over 2.33 metres in a low-key British league meeting a week ago.
Instead, he ended up in the unfamiliar position of ninth with only 2.05 metres to his name after failing to get his five-stride training run-up in the groove.
‘It's embarrassing! 2.05 metres it's ridiculous,’ confessed Smith afterwards.
‘I can't remember the last time I jumped that sort of height but today's performance doesn't concern me.
My coach and I planned to use this meeting as training and it just turned out to be bad training.’
CURTIS ROBB: Fast…and ready for faster
Smith, the highest jumper in the world last year, was expected to be a certainty for gold at Crystal Palace.
The expectations were particularly high after he went over 2.33 metres in a low-key British league meeting a week ago.

AXED England paceman Phil DeFreitas was involved in a bizarre window smashing incident at Old Trafford yesterday.
De Freitas needed on-field treatment to his right hand before a ball was bowled in Lancashire's Sunday league game against Essex and only minutes after England's high noon selection for the second Lord's test.
Daffy was shattered by the news that he'd been replaced by Essex's reprieved rebel tourist Neil Foster.
And a pane of glass in the Old Trafford dressing room area was shattered as the Lancashire players came out to field some of the glass landed in England spinner Peter Such's kit bag.
But Lancashire manager David Hughes cleared up the situation later, saying: ‘It was a complete accident.
Daffy was going downstairs and slipped on one of the steps.
He put his arm out and put it through a glass panel.
‘Some glass fell on the stairs, although some landed in Peter Such's bag.
When Daffy got out to the middle he realised he'd nicked his hand, and that he needed treatment.’
GRAEME HICK has been given the all clear for Thursday's second Test against Australia at Lord's despite cracking a toe.
X-rays have revealed a fracture but Worcestershire and England physio Dave Roberts said ‘As far as I am concerned there should be no problem about Graeme playing at Lord's.’
SKIPPER Hugh Morris led Glamorgan to a crushing 10 wicket victory over Surrey at The Oval.
Morris finished a frustrating two runs short of his century but had the consolation of sharing a partnership of 169 with Steve James (65 not out) Glamorgan's highest ever Sunday League opening partnership.
Neither batsman was troubled although Morris always looked the more positive player, thumping 11 fours in his 134 ball unbeaten 98.
James was more circumspect, finding the boundary three times during the 144 balls he faced.
Graham Thorpe's first Sunday League half-century of the season was the highlight of the Surrey innings.
But his 75 contained just one boundary and in all there were just six fours in the innings as Surrey crawled to a paltry 168 all out in 49 of the allotted 50 overs.
England silence the critics with a Brazil special
Nuts to you!
ENGLISH football can hold its head up high again after David Platt's 47th minute header crowned a magnificent display against world giants Brazil in Washington.
Graham Taylor's battling heroes could not quite hold on for a win that would have allowed the beleaguered England manager to say ‘Nuts’ to his critics.
But they wiped away the national disgrace of Wednesday's defeat to America's soccer novices by outfighting one of the favourites to win next year's World Cup here in the States.
And, after two weeks that would have cracked a lesser man, Taylor proved he still has what it takes to ensure that England can qualify to be one of the outside contenders.
Yet again England were indebted to Platt, who celebrated his 27th birthday just two days ago and has been restricted to the bench by an ankle injury.
But when he was given his chance at half-time, he scored within two minutes, grabbing his 19th goal in his 41st game for his country, and his eighth in his last eight appearances with an unstoppable header.
With debut goalkeeper Tim Flowers in fine form, England came within 13 minutes of a victory that no one expected after World Cup disasters in Poland and Norway.
Respite
But to the screams of excitement from the biggest crowd ever to gather in the Robert F Kennedy Memorial Stadium, over 54,000 of them, Marcio Santos set up a furious climax with a diving header.
England without half the team they will be expected to send out against Poland at Wembley on September 8 survived to give Taylor the respite he needs.
At five games without a win, it is still England's worst run since 1985, and only two game short of the all-time low of seven games, set in 1958.
But it averted the nightmare prospect of four consecutive defeats as they prepare to end their marathon season against Germany in Detroit next Saturday.
Those who question Taylor's future were left to swallow a performance that went a long way to answering the questions against the England manager.
All the speculation about whether he can still motivate his players, and whether they would still play for him disappeared in a flurry of sharp-toothed tackles and gutsy running.
And Taylor showed his brain is still functioning with a resilient game plan that countered Brazil's touch-passing and darting spin-offs.
But even with England manning the barricades so heroically, they still needed luck to hold on.
Early on, Gary Pallister missed Valdeir's low cross and the ball ran on to unmarked captain Rai, who shot weakly at debutante goalkeeper Flowers.
Then Valdeir shrugged through David Batty's desperate lunge and took a return pass from Careca only to produce a weak shot.
VINDICATED: Graham Taylor's smile says it all
United States…3 Germany…4
LAZIO striker Karlheinz Riedle scored a superb headed hat-trick as Germany beat the United States at Soldier Field, Chicago but it was a close-run thing.
After Juergen Klinsmann had fired the Germans ahead Riedle scored twice in five minutes midway through the first half and put Germany 4–1 clear with his third in the 59th minute.
But just as the Americans looked to be heading to a heavy and humiliating defeat in their first ever game against Germany, they struck back with two goals in seven minutes to set up a tense finish.
And it was German-born midfielder Thomas Dooley, goalscorer in the upset 2–0 win over England, who was the American hero again with two goals against the nation who ignored him.
Nation needed that performance, says goal hero
A great result: Platt
ENGLAND hero David Platt hailed the 1–1 draw against Brazil in Washington as ‘a great result for the nation’.
The Juventus midfielder, who scored his 19th goal for his country within two minutes of his half-time introduction, admitted the recent defeats against Norway and the USA had been bitter disappointments.
‘We needed that performance today as a nation, not just as players or manager,’ he said.
But beleaguered boss Graham Taylor asked if the pressure was off replied with a wry smile: ‘Not really.’
But he said: ‘It was a very good performance and a good result.
It's good experience for when we return in ‘94.
‘It's not been the best of times for us result-wise recently which makes it an even better performance.’
He explained why he sent on Platt: ‘In the first half we had a great deal of possession but we needed to move the Brazilians about, we needed to hurt them a bit more.
‘David gives us that little bit extra, though we wanted to play the same tight 4–4-2 formation.
‘But I'm very pleased with everybody.
I didn't want this to be an easy tournament and the benefits are being shown by the invaluable experience players are picking up.’
Brazilian coach Carlos Alberto Parreira criticised England for being too defensive.
‘I think there was one team trying to win,’ he said, ‘the other was trying not to let the opposition play.
At the end England did not want to know about coming forward.’
But Taylor retorted: ‘You can't open yourself up against such a fine Brazilian side, otherwise they will tear you to shreds.’
The James Street Station tower stands amid the rubble
Change to starting system now ‘inevitable’
CHANGES to the starting system for next year's Grand National are now inevitable in the wake of the official report into the fiasco.
The Connell inquiry found that the ‘grey gate’ starting system used at Aintree was outdated and inadequate and blamed the course executive and the Jockey Club for not replacing it.
A separate Jockey Club inquiry into starting procedures, headed by Brigadier Andrew Parker Bowles, is expected to report by the end of the summer when several changes are likely to be recommended.
Prominent racing historian Reg Green said urgent action was needed to prevent the National that never was becoming the National without a future.
He said: ‘The National is the racing showpiece of the world and we need to act now to stop it being destroyed by the apathy and negligence of the ruling body and the actions of a few animal rights protesters and rowdies.
‘It is no wonder we are becoming the laughing stock of the world.’
Since April's farce, more than 60 innovative suggestions for alternative starting methods have flooded into Aintree.
They range from the simple, such as sawdust starting lines, to the sophisticated, including electromagnetic beams and parallel tapes.
So far, only starting stalls have been ruled out.
Difficulties with the present ‘grey gate’ system, in which the starter pulls a lever to raise a 65 yard-long elastic tape, have been known for some years.
The Sir Michael Connell inquiry discovered that in 1991, starter Capt Keith Brown had requested two alterations reduction in the width of the starting gate and switching the side of the starter's rostrum.
Only the second change was implemented.
Two months before the race, acting course steward Rod Fabricius telephoned Captain Brown to discuss the possibility of using a different system, but this was allegedly rejected by the starter.
The following month he urged Captain Brown to check carefully ‘for everybody's peace of mind’ that the grey gate system at Aintree was working properly.
This has been strenuously denied by Capt Brown.
Mr Green, 55, author of the definitive Grand National chronicle, A Race Apart, added: ‘There's nothing wrong with the present starting system so long as it is operated properly.
‘It's been in use since 1925.
But this time the tape was sagging so low it was around the horse's knees.
It was an accident waiting to happen.’
Blow for ‘blot on landscape’ golf range owner
A GOLF driving range, dubbed a ‘blot on the landscape’ by planners, must be reduced in size, a Government inspector has ruled.
John Fenney, owner of Croft Golf Centre, in Cross Lane, Croft, near Warrington, has been told he must pull down 10 of his 20 driving bays.
Mr Fenney also has been ordered to comply with a landscaping scheme; close the centre by 9pm every evening; and make sure that his floodlights are switched off by that time.
At a public inquiry in March, Mr Fenney appealed against three enforcement notices issued by Warrington Borough Council requiring him to reduce the size of the driving range.
He claimed that 85,000 people had used the range over a two-year period and that outdoor sport was acceptable on green belt land.
But the inspector has upheld the council's view that the range is visually damaging to the area.
In his report the inspector said: ‘The building does not harmonise with its surroundings.’

AXED England paceman Phil DeFreitas was involved in a bizarre window smashing incident at Old Trafford yesterday.
DeFreitas needed on-field treatment to his right hand before a ball was bowled in Lancashire's Sunday league game against Essex and only minutes after England's high noon selection for the second Test at Lord's.
Daffy was shattered by the news that he'd been replaced by Essex's reprieved rebel tourist Neil Foster.
And a pane of glass in the Old Trafford dressing room area was shattered as the Lancashire players came out to field some of the glass landed in England spinner Peter Such's kit bag.
But Lancashire manager David Hughes cleared up the situation later, saying: ‘It was a complete accident.
Daffy was going downstairs and slipped on one of the steps.
He put his arm out and put it through a glass panel.
‘Some glass fell on the stairs, although some landed in Peter Such's bag.
When Daffy got out to the middle he realised he'd nicked his hand, and that he needed treatment.’
DeFreitas's hand injury, which was bandaged by Lancashire physio Laurie Brown, didn't affect his bowling or his catching.
He took 2–38 in 10 overs, and eagerly snapped up a chance offered by Graham Gooch off Peter Martin.
Announcement of the England team, originally scheduled for 10.00am, had been delayed by two hours so that Gooch could give Daffy the bad news.
DeFreitas had been considered fortunate to be selected for the first Test, when he was left out of the original squad but leapfrogged Essex seamer Mark Ilott after Alan Igglesden pulled out injured on the eve of the game.
Foster, who will today be fined by Essex for kicking over two stumps in frustration during Thursday's play in the championship match, was surprised and delighted.
‘It was a surprise because I'm aware I haven't taken many wickets this season, although I do feel I've been bowling well.’
he said.
GRAEME HICK has been given the all clear for Thursday's second Test against Australia at Lord's despite cracking a toe.
X-rays have revealed a fracture but Worcestershire and England physio Dave Roberts said ‘It's a tiny crack.
As far as I am concerned there should be no problem about Graeme playing at Lord's.’
A POWERFUL low drive by Nick Summerbee earned England a 1–0 win over Scotland and eased them into the final of the Under-21 tournament in Toulon last night.
Summerbee struck right on the stroke of half-time to set up a clash with France impressive 3–0 winners over Portugal in the final tomorrow.
An affectionate Brand of humour
Festival of Comedy
ROYAL COURT
Review by Lew Baxter
WITHOUT a doubt Jo Brand has stamped her own special mark on the British comedy scene with a style of stand-up humour that is delivered like the rattle of a Gattling gun and just as devastating.
Her appearance in Liverpool was a singular coup for the Festival of Comedy and must rank as the premiere attraction.
Brand, kitted out in skintight leggings and a vast black smock effort, firstly lulls an audience into a sympathetic mood with a collection of self abusive comments.
Then swiftly she launches into a staccato attack on political buffoonery and the Government in general before lashing at the crass assumptions that men make about women, and reaching the parts of chaps' angst-filled sexuality that mere innuendo could never find.
She is, of course, renowned for her critical essays punctuated with cusses on the male of the species and doesn't spare the blushes or the punches when exposing them to ridicule.
But then she also spends some time persuading the audience to laugh at her own idiosyncrasies and rather portly shape.
Her declared love of cakes has become an established part of her repertoire.
But there is a remarkable ability to find affinity with a mixed audience which lifts her act above a mere diatribe.
It is almost an affectionate tirade and she handled a male heckler very, very gently.
Well, at least for her.
Although this former psychiatric ward sister can appear world weary, cynicism dropping from every pore, there is a tongue in cheek panache that produces a double reaction as the barbs strike home; the ‘oof’ gut jerk followed immediately in some cases by a form of enlightenment.
Clever, witty and challenging?
Certainly, yet also a ruthlessly accomplished observer of men's and women's foibles.
Jo was ably supported by Chester's Jeff Green who, apart from a steady steam of rib ticklers, demonstrated a flair for ad libbing.
During a protracted confrontation with a drunken heckler he deservedly came out the winner both on points and then with a clear knockout; the humiliated toper slinking out by a side door.

WILLIAMS motor racing team has described a report questioning the legality of most cars in the 1993 Formula 1 world championship as ‘regrettable in its content and regrettable in its timing’.
The stewards sent a shock wave through leading teams by admitting that the F1 Technical Delegate had found every team except Lola were using cars which conflicted with the technical regulations particularly in relation to active suspension and traction control.
Williams said in a statement that they ‘sincerely hoped’ the validity of Nigel Mansell's world drivers' championship and the Williams-Renault world constructors' championship would not be called into question by the contents of the bulletin.
‘The team's suspension system has been identical for the past 22 Grands Prix, that is since the beginning of the 1992 world championship.
Its conformity with the regulations has never been called into question until now.’
If the technical regulations are applied vigorously, massive upheaval could follow in the three weeks between yesterday's race and the eighth round of the world championship in France.

Aintree flagman Ken Evans under fire in Jockey Club inquiry for 1993 Grand National shambles
Backing for official in National fiasco
By Andrew Forgrave Daily Post Staff
AINTREE racecourse yesterday leapt to the defence of the £5-a-race flagman accused of bearing the major blame for this year's Grand National fiasco.
Senior Jockey Club stewards will today decide whether to summon 57year-old part-timer Ken Evans before a disciplinary committee, after the inquiry into the ‘National that never was’ found he twice failed to signal a false start.
Racecourse officials and race starter Capt Keith Brown could also face heavy fines after coming in for stiff criticism.
But last night Aintree management backed Mr Evans for his actions, and vowed to challenge vigorously any disciplinary action against alleged breaches of racecourse rules.
Signal
The world's most famous steeplechase, watched by 50,000 spectators and a global TV audience of millions, ended in farce when 30 riders failed to realise that a second false start had been declared.
Mr Justice Connell's inquiry, set up by the Jockey Club, refused to accept Mr Evans' evidence that on both occasions he waved his flag to signal to the riders that the race had been stopped.
The inquiry report also said he appeared to have sprinted off the track for his own safety a finding strongly challenged by course officials.
But course chairman Mr Peter Greenall said: ‘We are standing by him.
He is well qualified to do the job he has done for many years and we will continue to employ him at races.’
Father-of-two Mr Evans Aintree recall man for the past seven years was not at his home in Bryn, near Wigan, yesterday.
He and his wife, Edna, were known to be distraught by the National furore.
Continued on Page 3 Continued from Page 1 Nevertheless, Mr Evans has continued working at Merseyside's other course, at Haydock Park, St Helens.
The inquiry also blasted Mr Evans for standing too close to the start- line.
‘We suspect that he was primarily concerned to leave the course as soon as possible because of the proximity of his selected position to the start,’ it said.
But the investigators stressed it would be ‘unfair and unrealistic,’ for Mr Evans to carry the sole blame for fiasco.
Race starter Captain Keith Brown was also criticised for allowing the horses to line up too close to the start line which led to the tape twice being broken.
It also found that the ‘grey gate’ starting system used at Aintree was outdated and inadequate and blamed the course executive and the Jockey Club for not replacing it.
When stewards realised what had happened after the second false start there was ‘a period of shocked dismay’ before anyone tried to stop the runaway field.
The judge, a Jockey Club member, told a news conference that they had reached their conclusion after studying hours of video tape of the race.
Aintree officials rejected the criticism, but said changes for next year's race were ‘inevitable.’
When the system was tested in the three days leading up to the event, it responded properly each time.
‘Whatever views there may be as to the suitability and continued use of the grey gate, it is the method of starting the Grand National, and it is approved by the Jockey Club,’ said managing director Charles Barnett.
He said recall man Mr Evans was ‘under the direct control of the starter.’
It was Capt Brown who decided where the recall man should stand, and he had failed to put Mr Evans in the right place.
Mr Evans also claimed signalling difficulties were caused because Capt Brown's starting flag was wrapped around the stick after the second start.
Mr Barnett said he did not believe any rules of racing had been broken, so he did not believe the Jockey Club could hold a disciplinary hearing.
