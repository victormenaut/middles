Saatchi plunges into red.
By Roger Cowe
SAATCHI and Saatchi, the world's largest advertising agency group, has plunged into the red after providing for £78million of reorganisation and redundancy cost.
The company has slashed the dividend, which is being paid out of reserves.
The company admitted it had been ‘a tough year’ but said the second half had seen a ‘substantial recovery’in performance of the main communications businesses as costs were controlled.
Central staff numbers have been cut by a quarter, including the closure of the office in Washington DC.
After those cuts, trading profits of the communications division were more than double those in the first half year and marginally ahead of the second half of last year as business held up.
But profits continued to fall in the troubled consultancy division which is up for sale.
And a £27million swing in interest costs left trading profits before tax virtually halved at £61million.
After tax, reorganisation costs and preference dividends that turned into a loss of £58million, but despite the loss the company is paying a minimal final dividend.
‘After careful thought it was decided that a final dividend of 1.6p be recommended,’ the board stated, ‘making a dividend of 9p for the year.
We believe this level to be sustainable.’
The group is negotiating the sale of its remaining consultancy businesses and says this will leave it with a strong and focused base in advertising and marketing services.
Charles and Maurice Saatchi have stepped back from the top executive roles and have recruited Frenchman Robert Louis-Dreyfus as chief executive.
Despite the results and the dividend being lower than expected, Saatchi shares rose 15p yesterday on hopes of a takeover bid.
