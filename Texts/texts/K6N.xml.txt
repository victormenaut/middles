Quite a lot  
Because there were a lot of people on the staff at that time.
Aye.
There'd be records somewhere I'm sure of them .
What did my father say?
He remembered when there was fifteen smokes went up here on this .

Yes.
So if you if you took that up and down  there'd be quite a lot.
Yes.
So you may know, there wasn't very many rich people about anyway.
No.
Except the  themselves, whether they were rich or not I don't know.
No.
That's the that was the state of affairs
And most of these folk, were they just being farm workers or croppers or

The sheep  
C O T E S , not  C O A T S .

another thing I was gonna ask you as well, your father Your parents both spoke Gaelic obviously.
Oh yes yes.
and did did they speak it to you when you were children?
Yes.
My mother did but my father didn't very much.
No?
He mostly spoke English to us younger ones anyway.
Yes.
But er we used to answer when our mother'd speak to us in Gaelic, we'd answer her back in English.
Oh.
Us younger ones.
Aha.
But er
 
Jeannie and my older sister Mary, they were perfect Gaelic speakers.
Mhm.
They used to speak Gaelic to one another when they were children.
Yes.
Converse in Gaelic.
But we were never as fluent as that you see because er they went to school then and they started coming home with English you see ad speaking English and we just 
Yes.
Mhm.
never got the same chance.
No I and and and was it not discouraged a wee bit at school.
No I don't think so here.
I heard it had been said that it was discouraged but er 
I heard that said aye.
I don't think so  never heard of it.

Yes.
Yes.
Gerald  
And his wife.

I  ask you when when you were younger  did you would there have been many of the folk in the place spoke Gaelic or was it dying out then or
Oh no quite a lot.
The older folk.
The older people.
Right.
The older people's all Gaelic they would speak.
So yes.
So you would get quite a quite a lot of it you would hear.
Oh yes.
Aha.
of course you there would just been my father and mother'd be speaking Gaelic all the time in the house you see .
Yes.
And we were it was just to us like English.
Yes.
Only we didn't practise speaking it you see .
Yes.
Yes.
Aye.
And the ploughmen that were here, too they would they come from the West.
Aha.
And they would have Gaelic.
So we was brought up in that atmosphere.
It would have been quite interesting having the two languages .
It would have been quite
Yeah.
quite er
We just
You do you g get a a best of both maybe I would imagine you know.
be quite sort of interesting  It was just er d I was gonna ask you about your name as well,, it doesn't sound very
It's not very high.

I never cut them all till about beyond the middle of June.
Aha.
But they're fairly dried out.

For the distillery's use
Aha.
Oh they used to cut a big lot.
But they stopped it I'm sure twenty years ago.
Yes they get all mechanized now.
Is it finished?
Oh no it's a good bit yet.
I cannae  can't quite see .
What's the next head?

And then if they got  in good condition  built up solid.
Aha.
And how how many haystacks would you have in a good year.
Oh well, latterly we'd have about ten haystacks right .
Aha.
And I remember the most corn stacks we had was twenty five.
Aha.
 
But er as a rule there'd be about sixteen or there about.
Aha.
Corn stacks.
That's quite quite good though.
Oh yes.
Quite.
.
So that's what you would have done with the corn  The hay was  the hay  the stalk?

And do you know when that stopped at all?
About nineteen six I think.
Aha.
Quite a while back.
Mhm.
Quite a while.
I was just thinking about also sheep shearing and stuff.
That you'd have done that yourselves as well?
Yes we used to  A whole lot would come here and I'll go somewhere else the next day you know, we used to help one another to sheep shearing.
Oh right.
Yes there were quite a crowd.

the sheep shearing.
And would had to make food for them and stuff like that?
Yes we did.

It would be quite a a busy time.
Well it was just a dinner you made for them you see .
Aha.
And they'll get tea at in the stack yard or wherever they were .
Aha.
Oh.
. And they would be all the hand shears of course.
Oh all the hand shears.
Mhm.
And how many days would it take?
Oh  maybe a matter of four or five hours we'd take here.
Oh right.
We we had  
 
two hundred and fifty sheep.
But if you'd
They did the harvest first you see.
Aha.
And then they did the sheep with the lambs.
Right.
And that 
was the biggest that had been about here.
Aha.
There's be about twenty clippers at it.
That's quite a lot.
There would be about a thousand to do in a day.
Aha.
Quite hard work.
long day  quite hard.
Nobody'll need a hand clipping around here now .
Not very much.
They all
doing it the other day.
I was doing it the other day yes.
Aha.
Yeah.
down the valley.
They're still doing a wee bit there.
But er there were two boys who  a machine beside.
Another thing I was gonna ask you about was erm I'd heard somebody mention ploughing competitions with horses.
Oh aye yes.
I wondered if you remembered any of them at all.
Yes because I I competed .
Ah you did.
Yes.
I was at the first one when I was fifteen.
Aha.
Was it quite a a big thing around here was it.
Oh what a great day  match.
Where where would they hold it?
Oh on different farms.
Say here one year, maybe another year up  and
Aha.
Different places.
Aha.
Well they'd just get a suitable field to keep the whole lot.
You get half an acre each to do.
Half an acre, that's quite a lot .
Mhm.
The horses would be all dressed up and everything.
Decorations and.
Be lovely that.
Nineteen thirty first was the ploughing match.
Nineteen thirty five .
Here .
They still have it in  with  But we never had a  one here.
No no, it was just  
the same.
No no I wouldn't think so.
Horse were nice.
Would would they have been the big heavy horses, the big Clydesdale  
 
Well they were mostly the Clydesdale but oh there were some light horses in it too.
Mhm.
But it was mostly the Clydesdales.
That would be it would a a s the straightest plough would it be or the straightest line would it have
Yes that was counted in it too and it had to be well parked.
Each furrow parked against the other to keep the  you see.
If you had holes in the seed bed that was a fault.
Aha.
It sounds like quite a skill .
Ah.
Just I was just gonna ask you really to maybe just  a change you know the difference between  day and know, maybe you can see quite a difference just er
Well of course you will, the population was
Yes and er the motor car.
No nobody with motorcars when we were young.
Aha er you mean, all horse transport or
or or walking.
Aha.
Or the bicycle of course.
But hardly anybody had a car.
But  
Well except the the  the .
And the doctor.
Who?
Oh the doctor .
relations.
Yes we remember going to school  would see the doctor's car.
Aha.
If he happened to come up the way.
The the roads would they have been quite good or
Oh they were quite good.
Well not as good as they are now.
They were er what you would call er broken metal on them.
Aha.
And  and rolled in.
Rolled in and what you called er water bound roads.
Er they done the broken metal and then they put  on the top of it and then they come along with a watering cart and er splashed water on it and then 
Aha.
drove the  down between the
Aha.
the broken metal and then the steam roller was back and fore on it and It was quite a good surface you know, but 
Aha.
Mm.
It was pretty rough and we used to go in Summer you know, barefeet,
Aha.
And we'd run in the middle of the road and today we couldn't stand it.
No no no  tough.
It would quite suitable for horses and stuff  
It would be very suitable for horses, even more so than  on the present roads there's there's there's a better grip.
Aha.
For horses.
But er that kind of road would be no use today with the speed of the cars, it would just
Too noisy.
slacken up in no time and
Aye.
Oh yes.
We used to see a lot of shepherds and flocks of sheep
Aha.
you know, on our way to school and it was just grey flocks of sheep with perhaps 
Oh aye.
two shepherds with them.
Coming from C as far as Caithness.

Well that's in er either stopping He stopped here one night.
Do you remember the deaf shepherd we called him.
Yes.
He left his flock up there and stayed here all night.
I think that's the only one I ever remember.
Cos we were off the road a wee bit you see.
Yes.
I remember er a flock staying here and the shepherds got their supper here and then they went on to for the night.
Oh aye.
Was a long long time ago.

Whether there was any truth in it or not I don't know 
 
but it was told to me that he dreamt it

Aha.
At last she touched him, Oh you're still there, poor .
