So that what we did was, first of all when you filled in your initial choice  and then we got a  a team choice  and now perhaps, what would make a lot of sense is that if we have  the first few  er  team answers one member of this team  er, and then we'll go through the others.
And
alright
the one thing we will certainly mark  is that the answer which you get does depend on the way in which you read some of the statements  or some of the principles.
Erm, but what I  wanted us to do is to start getting some discussion going and, so that you're actually getting a bit closer to one another.
Let's go through this team here.
You can do it  Mary, if you like.
What, what did you get for the  fir , or what did you reckon the first set of claims you decided wanted to be accomplished.
Truth.
Everybody agree with truth.
Yes.
Yeah.
Yes.
Yes.
I think so.
Erm  and that's not just in selling, is it?
I mean that's in everything.
Er  you get,sa instructor and they say that if a training course which is gonna start at half past eight on February the tenth, erm  yeah well that's what we gotta do then you gotta start looking to the planning towards haven't you?
And you gotta there, when you gotta there, and so on and so on.
So he gets  the first  and decide what you wanna get to.
But if you don't do that, any road'll get you there.
And I think that's something that we'll certainly discuss tomorrow, on Thursday.
If you are, what I want you to do is to, to create a, a team plan  and the first thing we need to decide in that team plan is where do we wanna get?
What do we wanna do?
Not, we wanna increase sales because everybody wants to do that, but if we've gotta increase sales, by what?
Is it five percent?
Ten percent?
Thirty percent?
We wanna get more, you know, there's th ,thi thi this er, there is no point really in saying things like, what I'd like to do is to improve the quality of the appointments because that don't tell you anything.
It has to be some solid reason.
Some absolute measurable thing.
Okay.
Any, any customers been another customer at all?
All of us.
All of us.
Yes I think so.
I think so.
Otherwise, we'd have all the  I'd be, be discussing what it is.
 
Right !
Means testing.
They're sort of sales for sales sake.
Yeah.
Oh.
I'm 
Erm 
just being awkward.
I, well 
 
there's nothing wrong with that.
As you know.
There's nothing wrong with that.
I mean we've all, we've all seen the results of any customer who's a bit of a nervous so sort haven't we?
Well, that's putting that well 
I think we have.
Dave I think.
As sorts.
Yeah, you dru , you draw up  one aren't you?
Mm mm.
Yeah.
That's right.
Yes.
I mean, it's er  it's wo , that's one we refer to as the Donnis mobile cos we can use that when the American Express comes through.
Erm, but the er, yes any customer know, knows when you're talking a load of nonsense.
Erm   thought so didn't they?
True.
A salesperson should never abandon hope of winning an account.
Which is really great!
Woo hoo!
That's a good one isn't it?
Well you have to something there.
Does anybody, everybody think true?
No.
Yeah.
Yeah , times change don't they?
Yeah.
Buyers change, companies change, attitudes change, markets change.
Our 
Yep.
Yes, they go off.
What about this one?
We'll ask Linda this time, when it says good plans, sell, require, retain.
I put false.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I think that has to be the  chain.
Yeah.
Because it might be a good plan today
Mm.
But I wonder how good it is  tomorrow?
You know, with things changing and that, and that.
Ah!
Here's a nice one.
Hmm.
Erm
Mm.
right, the effective sales person puts most of his or her effort into prospecting for new accounts?
False.
False.
True.
I put true.
True.
Somebody else er
 
 
you're prospecting rather than using your current 
What about your time plan this morning?
The sheets, the sheets this morning  proved that.
Yeah.
Three hours prospecting on the B L S and three hours prospecting from  from nine o'clock till twelve.
Yeah.
That's six hours prospecting.
I put true.
I'm, I'm with you lads.
Yeah?
 
Er, you did er have sort of fair factual discussion then?
I were only one 
Yeah.
who put true.
Right.
These, put
Yes, I'd have thought it was true.
Erm
True.
I'd have thought that what is, what is 
I'm not saying , obviously if somebody existing based on that .
That is, that is right.
You have to look after your existing customers of course whether they are 
Well you see most of us don't do this.
It doesn't say time Peter, it says effort.
That's right.
Effort.
Yeah.
Yeah, but you put, you must be putting about five hours effort of a day into prospecting accounts.
Three hours, nine till twelve prospecting  or cold calling whatever you wanna call it.
Another two, three hours of doing 
But 
this.
Yeah, but you look when you're receiving the trade from the prospecting 
 
when you receive your trade from a prospect 
 
you have this amount of trade in and this amount of prospect and your telling me if I have half trade in and half prospect, I'd like to see the difference in how much time you spent on 
Yeah but 
on each one.
yeah but the thing is you don't do it, it's a  
You don't have a , you don't have a se se 
So you prospect.
Yeah but if you did, yeah but it's a very difficult question.
Effort and then a prospect an area where you want
Yeah.
to, you've got time there  
 
Yeah but you do, well you do actually measure a regular more distance.
At the end of the day you do need to get business 
Well I put 
in.
yeah, but there's no point in losing business  for new business.
That's true.
But we're not saying that.
But it's 
Yeah, but if if 
actually time spent prospecting.
It's not time
if .
Yeah.
Then, then
Even though it's not.
It's not.
Well I think that's, I think you can categorize, you can say right  e , the effectiveness is if you spend seventy five percent of your effort getting prospect accounts on, but you still use twenty five percent of it, to, to 
 
Yeah.
Exactly.
To retain existing, then you're still gonna be paying the business on and you're still gonna be able to look after er
Right.
the existing.
You just, it's just 
I don't know.
whether you get that one percent 
What d'ya think?
a fortnight 
Sorry?
it makes no 
What d'ya think?
difference.
What do I think?
Yeah, but John when you say the word 
What d'ya think?
effort you want .
I think if Tom  was sat there it would be ninety percent.
You know?
 
Because he, he didn't 
He just .
really wanna be in on anything else but except business.
Right.
Once you shared the time.
Honestly.
Number six then.
 
I'm happy to be .
Maximizing sales volume is the most important task of the sales person?
Oh, solely.
False, you put here.
I put false here .
Well, I think you need to recognize that really sales volume is, it it takes us back again to the fact that any customer is better than no customer at all.
We were saying, we were just saying maximizing sales as in more  otherwise it's sales potential rather 
Yes.
than
Er er, er what we're, what 
Maximizing what we've got.
what we are about, or what every sales company should be about is making money.
Yeah.
And, er er and just increasing sales volume, or maximizing sales volume ain't gonna do it.
Ah we ought to more or less max , maximize the 
Yeah.
sales figures 
Right.
It's, it's maximizing the sale of the revenue and, and rising the revenue is what we talked about.
Oh yes, that one.
What's it called?
So a resistance can be used with that and of course it indicates interest in the product?
True.
True.
All the time that, that's what 
Yeah.
an objection is.
Mhm.
And I think that's, there's something which we  most of us fear.
I hope not.
So the resistance is diminished by stretching the novel features of a new product?
Jane?
Mm.
What do you think?
Agree.
We had a 
I think 
discussion about this as well.
I think we misunderstood novel features as a bad thing to be honest.
Yes, we were saying we we can 
No, but you, we we were asking about .
you can
Novel features.
you can overcome objections 
Novel is the word there.
by  offering the benefits of a product.
Not necessarily novel though is it?
No, no, that's what I'm saying novel, that's why novel's the key word.
Novel .
What have you got the one right wing here?
Nothing at all.
 
Yeah.
But well 
I had , well I had 
er er 
false at first and then we had a big discussion about it.
Yeah, right.
We had false particularly until we, new product coming out.
 
I would think that was false to be honest.
Yeah.
Er
It's the novel, that did it.
And well  
Yeah, yeah.
I think what happens all the time, I understand why, if you put true you me , you you put it  was that the one thing that sales people always desperately want is something new.
Okay?
Er,differently, that's not new.
Erm, and I think that probably er, I think that's false but  it's er interesting discussion.
Yes.
Er  when a sales person closes  he, though I suppose I should say, that he or she should use that closing technique which is most suited to his or her personality?
This is the one we were debating.
Yeah.
I had true, but I got outnumbered 
I had true.
so I put a false in that one.
You got outnumbered.
Right.
I had true.
I had true.
Said false.
Me and David said false.
True.
What, what 
 
should we be co considering the customer at any time?
You see, in my view  each, each customer is different.
You don't close the same way with every customer.
Right.
So is it the fact that the  that what th th th the close should be most suited to  the customer
Yeah.
Yeah.
rather than ourselves?
Yeah.
That'd be fair I think.
Because you close with your own personality anyway don't you really?
Right.
I think 
And also , he's buying you as well as he's buying the product.
Yes, I think so, I think, that is of course, I I think that  erm  that the close which you use
Yeah.
has to be geared to the customer.
Er, and not your personality.
And this is a nice one then isn't it?
The direct close  the most successful technique because it's the most honest.
Don't ask us.
Don't ask us.
No.
Pretty good was it?
Yeah.
We got anti 
That's right.
That's right.
What about this side?
Well we got true, but I 
True.
would say false.
 
I would say false as well.
He said true and we said true.
He's , well  we start off with that.
Oh I'll let you off.
It's an interesting one because er er, really the thing,th the sentence goes, or the, the principle works very well until you get to the word honest.
Yeah.
That's right.
Exactly.
That's what we're laughing at.
Bingo!
That's what we're arguing on.
What the hell's honesty got to do with it?
Ah I I think er
The most obvious.
Yes, that's right.
I'm not sure that honesty's a word which I would er  don't get me wrong, I'm not suggesting that a salesman's dishonest, don't think that.
What I am suggesting though I think is that  you know, a close which is referred to as being the best of course is th the most honest is the
Yeah the
Well well Peter can, can't you remember 
 
 Espinear formula?
Yes.
Where we were dru , the spi , the  Espinear used to be drummed down for about five, six, seven years.
That's right.
So he would have known.
That's right.
Assuming the
Actually you could have gone to the A M Express conference and heard it.
I played a cowboy actually talking about
Espinear close.
 Espinear assuming that it is  question physical action judgements trapped the narrative close,and ask for the order.
That's right.
So 
How did you memorize that?
 
Because  that's the way you learnt it.
Used to be in all the quizzes.
That's right.
Ever heard 
Yeah.
of a  Espinear close That's right.
What do 
They all can  
.
After you.
everybody can remember what it stands for  but they can't do it .
That's right.
Well, ask for the order it is.
Yeah.
That's right.
They all er ask for the order
It's the,i the di , they used the word honest .
No.
Ah sure well that,th th that's, that's what, but anyway, as long as it created discussion, that was the point of it.
And good product of service will sell itself?
False.
No.
No.
No, that'll be the day won't it?
False.
Yeah.
False that one is.
A knowledge of human psychology is important when 
False again.
selling?
Now then  that's
Only one of the seven  up here, we all said true.
True.
But bear in mind she's, you know, she's walked out of the
That's right.
So what do you think of that?
I think we all feel that's true don't we?
I do.
Apart from the odd er fact and most of research  we don't need
erm, we don't need a degree in it, but some .
Other people's problems.
It's a 
Yeah I do.
Cos last time
I'm going, anyway.
with the exact same sheet that I did to start with.
 
You said we didn't need anything because I 
Social skills 
true last time 
Right.
and it was
We're not getting rid of that now.
Social skills are relatively unimportant for a salesperson?
False.
I think we need certain social skills don't you?
Yes.
Erm, and more so on the telephone than we ought  and more on the telephone than some, sometimes we do  er erm  face to face.
A person does not buy the product but rather buy what it'll do for him or her.
True.
Yes, that's right.
A former customer, one who no longer buys anything is of little value?
False.
False.
Yeah.
I think so.
Cos he changes doesn't he?
And er  okay?
Right, well let's generate the do , discussion and er  get you all er  involved in something else for  three quarters of an hour.
Right.
I want now to  show you this er  film then, and there's no point in having   Alright we're taking on everything.
Doing  far more than we can reasonably do and if you like, doing it  by very definition, badly, or worse than it could have done.
Right, that's one message that comes out of it.
What else?
Slow.
No effort.
Right.
There's no thinking time at all is there?
No.
Right.
Okay.
No, there's no planning or  nothing's diarized.
Everything's all 
No plan.
Mm.
No diary.
There's, there's no concentration 
 
Yeah.
no concentration with the job in hand.
Everything
Looks like me and Jack .
distracts him from what he's doing and he  the distraction.
The what?
No plans.
No details.
Never saw one job through.
Mm mm.
He kept on doing one job .
Yeah, instead of, instead of from 
One from the other.
from start to finish he didn't just
Finish one job at a time.
finish one job.
In which 
Yeah.
it would one job less to do.
So, this fact that there's no plan, or appeared to be no diary although there was a diary wasn't there?
He had stuff wrote 
Yeah,
down on it.
Yeah, and he didn't, he didn't listen to any of the people
Yeah.
what the people 
Ha!
had to say, he just  just said yes, yes, all afternoon.
Yeah, he just 
Right.
kept saying yes to everything just to barge them off.
He didn't listen did he?
No.
No, no, not at all.
He had too many interruptions.
Hmm.
Er we said the, said ignoring the needs.
Mm.
Where was that?
Well his secretary when he was on 
Yeah.
the phone.
Yeah.
And he kept checking up.
And he 
The guy in 
sort of hung up on him.
the guy in the car park when he forgot to ring him back about some important business.
The managing director?
He kept ringing.
Yeah.
The managing director  spoke  from the car and he never followed it up .
And he kept 
That's right.
he wanted to be the decision maker, and he wanted to make the decision on every single thing himself and then he was turning round and saying to his secretary, well can't you do anything?
Do I have to do everything?
Whereby he, had obviously made it clear from the start
Mm.
he was the only one with the authority.
He kept checking up on erm 
Not that he trusted anyone either because when they were doing the wages 
kept checking up on people's like erm  capabilities as well instead of getting on with his own job he kept checking up on their them all as well.
So he's checking up on everybody?
Yeah.
Even if he lets them do something.
Mm.
Mhm.
The wages, he didn't trust her with the wages.
He messed about on the calculator.
That's right.
You'd expect a wages clerk to be able to handle it wouldn't you?
Yeah.
Er, and also that er when he went into 
Hmm!
appointment  he erm  he let, he let the client take over the  the call because he wasn't erm prepared enough  when he weren't there.
Right, so when he went in to see somebody  he had 
That's it.
done no preparation at all 
No.
had he?
No.
He, he didn't know why he was there did he?
He wanted five percent discount didn't he?
Told him, selling a million pounds worth of flour e er flour a year and he had his twenty first coming up and apparently,he starts spilling the beans 
Good.
on how much he had really .
That's right.
Er
He doesn't  a great deal with the, the guy cos he .
So when he says no plan here, so it's not only no plans in the day it filtered through to
His work.
Yeah.
Everything.
his his , everyday work as well.
Yeah.
Mm.
He just pu , he just kept putting off important things as well.
That's right.
And end, end up with
Er, yeah, I think, I think it's this stress that he felt he was under which led him to panic.
You could just see him getting more and more het up but if he just sort of sat down and wrote things down what he'd got to do  and do, try and do them in a set order.
Mhm.
Mm.
Yeah.
That Mr  was a 
And I, I mean that was the root problem really.
That's it.
But Mr  
Mm.
the director had him wrapped round his little finger for that five percent.
Didn't he?
Yeah.
Mm.
What did he say tha then?
Because, he really believes, what was that bit?
Well he was just telling  er Mr  
The person was telling him or or or the ?
Th , no he was telling the customer he was selling a million pounds worth of flour a year and that and I, I've got a twenty first birthday er, you know,wi , coming up, party well after that.
Aha.
He's not worried about that, he just 
Yeah.
wants his five percent.
Yeah.
That's right.
That's right.
So there's no, no preparation a at all 
Oh no.
on that er particular  er interview was there?
He didn't  he also didn't let people know what he was doing as well.
Didn't keep staff informed.
Did what?
Didn't keep his staff informed of what was happening.
Just, just expected them to know.
Didn't tell them.
When he met those three people 
He didn't so so 
Yeah, he didn't tell anyone about that.
he didn't, and the guy didn't ask him .
But why didn't he tell anybody about ?
 
Cos he was scared, embarrassed.
He was embarrassed wasn't he?
Yeah.
Didn't wanna tell anybody about it cos he knew they, they they could say well  can't you organize things better than that?
What's the  real sub total now of this guy of ours?
Right, so there's
He had no organization.
None at all, I mean he he when he saw John Cleese on that erm computer, said what's that?
He didn't know.
Way behind it.
He was really sort of ignorant about things like that.
That's right.
He was way behind with the technology.
He thought he was helping everybody and doing everything for himself but he weren't, he was stopping 
He was just like a hindrance  wasn't he ?
what are we doing?
Yeah.
He was causing more problems.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's what happens.
He's trying to be all things to all men isn't he?
Yeah.
Yeah.
And doing  it's not so much that you're doing everything wrong, it's just the one thing which being done right  is that the    other way of putting it  that, the guy because he's so well organized  what effect does that have on everybody else then?
It snowballs doesn't it?
It throws everyone out.
They're like chasing their tails cos they're the ones who 
Yeah.
They're not as stressed as he is at the end of the day because .
Well it it 
 
throws everybody else around you.
That's right.
They
Linda?
Yes Linda?
Cos he keeps starting something and then he shouts something else comes back and then you  but you end up doing, nothing gets done.
Yes.
I see.
What effect did it have on his private life?
He sa , he missed a party and missed a sa a child's party and er  what have you.
He planned to go out for dinner 
Well he's just so organized there.
he planned to go out for dinner, he's even forgot about that as well.
With 
He 
his wife.
but he lives with this  he doesn't  really make time for anything.
Yes.
You see, it's, it's very difficult isn't it, that  that we probably spend a third of our life  at work  which makes it very important.
Erm  by, as many definitions we spend a third of our lives at work,whe where you spend the other two thirds?
Bed.
And  and so we've got the other two thirds  this between, getting to bed and and spending it with the, the, the family.
And if you can't organize yourself at work then it's a  ten to a penny that you can't organize the other bits either.
And, and so what happens is  th the whole thing just keep, it's just compounded  worser , it just gets worse and worse and worse and worse.
Now I'm not suggesting for one moment that anybody who has all the problems that  dear Mr  has there, but I think we might be able to learn something, do you?
Yeah.
We might be able to pack, put one or two things into some sort of order.
What I want to do today, what I've been trying to do today  is to spend that time looking at  certain aspects of the way the business works, the way you work.
You are very important people, you are running  one million pound a year businesses.
And also for all of us to learn something about each other.
Because you're spending all day together, and we'll keep breaking you off into, in twos, into your groups so that you can  learn any more about one another.
And also, of course, you've got  the sort of social thing between you.
Well I mean you don't have to see, so this you've got this sort of social thing there.
You can actually  learn something else about one another by  normal discussions between  during the course of the conversation now.
What that will enable to do, I hope, is tomorrow, to spend our time trying to put some of these things right.
If, if right they need to be put.
If you are already working to maximum efficiency, then great!
All you will have done so far is spent the two days here , eat sandwiches, followed by , said a couple of jokes  and, come to that,.
Friday afternoon we could  and we'll have a look at .
See what Colin would make of that.
Though I suspect  that what we will find if we  really are honest with ourselves that  quite a lot of things which we see here are not always exaggerated from the point of the exercise, that we exaggerate things out of all proportion so that we can actually start looking at it and seeing .
We will come back to that.
In fact we'll come back that a bit later this afternoon.
I want to  ask you  to do   thought you, content, based on that.
I just wanna be absolutely sure that you haven't made some  terribly dramatic changes in your lifestyle which are not justified by what we've done.
After ?
Erm  no  I'd like just to go through that if I can.
Erm, and then I wanna give you one last exercise  before we go.
Not this sort of er, this sort of thing.
Erm  and what I want you to do tonight please, in your teams  I want you to make a list  tonight, in your teams of all the things you have to do at work.
Okay?
Everything.
Lunchtimes as well?
Right.
It can be, yeah we had a stop for lunch, we had to have cups of tea, we had to go to ou , out the back and have a fag cos we can't smoke in the office.
Write all the things you have to do.
Okay?
Now, don't worry about it now when you come back to this  right, you can do that in the bar if you like, that  okay?
Bearing in mind it's a team focus course so I'm not giving you loads of work which takes you apart from one another, what we do is  you talk together, and spend time together.
And at the end of last week they had a .
No actually it was
No, I think that
They er 
Er er, what?
They, they might now
Well you know 
 
actually it's a bit boring down there now but they, they had to put my, my explanation of the price of  petrol  er down, there's nowhere to thing, cos th the last time I was down there I asked for a pint of bitter and this guy bought it me and said and I wanted two pound thirty or something.
And I said to him, do you know  what they have to do a produce a gallon of petrol?
And he said no, and I explained it, er, you know, first of all you created universe and then you, then you get all these very important people, geologists and they put er satellites and find th this oil underground, and then you drill, well it's usually under the sea anyway, so you produce a, and this go on and on and on until the guy's now wondering what you're talking about
and then when you get the to the end of it all you sa you say and they sell that for an eighth of a price that you charge for your bloody beer!
And, you know, and, there's absolutely no justification whatsoever.
And, but they, er you can't do it cos they're all so bored to death with it now.
Give a brief desista , description of where you get a pint of petrol from.
Well, then they charge you thirty P for it.
But it costs two pounds 
If you find nobody wants it.
Yeah.
Eh?
Just the fact nobody wants to do it.
But he wants it to go up one percent.
 
That's what I thought.
 
It's like that when I do my Victor Meldrew bit it's er, doesn't go down very well.
Right now look,th , right, so let's just have a look erm at mutton Jeff down there, what, what have yo , what have you decided that you, your thoughts are now, strengths weaknesses or whatever, how are you gonna change?
Or can you change?
Er, strengths?
Well, I think the first gotta be objectives.
Right.
Erm  using team resources  erm  and commanding respect and you do this by enthusiasm.
Right.
Erm  we're very good at  lot of plans, practical working, and carrying out in a specific way.
Yes.
And a bit of a change  and  again, with self- discipline we're realists but we won't look at same thing  
Does the self-discipline actually show itself?
I mean, in those, those time things that you did, those time box, did it show the self-discipline?
Yeah.
I think you've got to be.
I thought it did show up, but I mean it wasn't part of  it's a natural part of
Right, so that's great.
Better for everyone.
Right.
Right, so I want, having all these virtues and whatever
What d'ya call the  whingies then?
Well there has to be the odd one  that'll take over Peter.
Yeah .
In the usual way.
Erm  analysing problems.
We seem to be more concerned with the job in hand, i e, our own team er er and not with the other teams, but if they're struggling then do offer to give them help.
Right okay.
That's very, very, gracious of you.
Well i it should be  erm,co cooperative of ourselves
Right.
in order to overcome any weaknesses that we may have that don't recognize 
Well 
that we've got.
Right.
Now based on what we've talked about so far today can you recognize any that you probably didn't think you'd got?
Yeah.
Or did you now recognize something you needn't of got but now somebody else has bought you that you better do something about it?
Aha.
And if so, what are they?
Erm, I didn't, like I say I know people who erm  especially with  about ourselves or anybody else.
Right.
So there's no real sort of company worked out, erm  in such details like that?
We're, we're paid to do a job to get the best for everything.
Right.
And your best, to do
Aha.
sort of concentrating if you like, on that particular effort
Aha.
rather than wider things.
Yes.
And so probably what we need to think about  is  how you can improve your contributions to the whole thing.
That's not so you, how I perform, but how you can improve your contributions there, we might have to
Yeah.
er er er erm, look at that.
Yeah.
Erm, we also, again I mean, as you say, we always look at ourselves and say we're the best team in the company.
Right.
Jeff's thinking that erm  but then we, we put that out and get information an d  so that's er, you know
A team game.
team game, yeah.
And get ourselves 
Right.
and then we, enable us to go on these  and get a bit of information from the .
Yeah.
We'd like to see some signs.
Give us a bit more cooperative and then 
Yeah.
the then, then
Yeah.
erm sometimes that's, that's about it but to be honest 
Well of course it does.
Sort of wandering round with your .
You'll have black eyes by then.
What ab about you two?
How do you know he's right?
How you actually feel?
Well I, well I say, we've looked at it slightly different because we've only, we've only worked together for five weeks.
Right.
Erm, so what we wanted to do was, we've had  we're doing quite well with the ov , erm, the five weeks we've been together but we wanna make sure that you do combat  erm  a successful pact.
Right.
So we looked at two areas where we've erm  we were both very weak, erm, and  I don't we could even, we couldn't even see it with regards this.
Right.
Erm, so we've, what we, we were looking at doing is trying to create an action plan  using those two areas each time to create strengths and  the other will slot together
Cos really
in the middle
the actual communication is there, but it's not constructive enough.
Yes.
Or perhaps, not about the right things at the time or perhaps concentrating on.
But is that, in some ways, I mean you can't be too critical about yourselves, some of that is because you  lack of experience within the, in 
Ex 
the company in that 
Ex 
you sell.
Yeah.
Chances are 
So I mean yo 
but I think that a sort of, the time we have perhaps on a  could be used a lot more constructively.
Well  I do.
You know, erm 
Right.
really
I mean we've both discussed, we both know, we've discussed things over and we've discussed a counter that, we're trying look at why all these things happen.
It's really getting things done in, in a like a, I dunno, a disciplined manner, like an ordered man , so each, what  to do the, we discuss what we, what we've got an action plan together and where it's fired at so it does work.
Is it based on what you, well the case history's there, I think I know the, the, other than in  performance, but based on that you should be able to do that.
Yeah.
Oh absolutely, yeah.
I think it's just having a bit of erm
Experience and ?
just having the discipline to sit down and make sure that we e , do actually work this out and then do cover all the areas.
Alright.
So what I'm, what I'm sa , saying now  is this, that based on what we talked about so far
Mhm.
is that tomorrow, when we start getting into planning, prioritizing, looking at where the new diaries and all that sort of stuff.
There's, one of the things we will do before you leave tomorrow, is you will have to produce an action plan.
Yes that's what 
Right.
that's what we did.
And it will be specific, it will be measurable, will be 
Yeah.
achievable, be renewable, be .
Yeah.
Yes.
Mm.
Now, if that's the case  once we've done that, okay?
And we'll then type it up for ya, and you'll take it away and it will be yours.
Right?
I'm not asking for money or taking anything from you.
You could say well, Jackie took this and you got one  leg on this table shorter than the other legs and we've jammed it under there  levels the table up.
Now what you'll be taking is erm 
It's, it's erm 
.
So what I'm saying is we need to be very, as soon as you get the stuff, that, if you wanna get anything out of this course at all, and what people do get out of the course, is the fact that by the time they leave here we've said right, that's the way we're going  that's what we're gonna aim for and it is reasonable time.
Mhm.
Yeah.
Cos they were only the real areas lacking and the  I'm quite high on  the complete finisher, whereby
You know by your roads.
you always go down the 
Right.
road.
That's okay.
Alright.
Jus just you.
Fairly true
Yeah.
of perhaps my characteristics cos I tend to go in  to work at eight o'clock just before I write any more in and I do have to clear everything before I even start the day.
Which you don't get any assistance.
I can't just sort of well I think 
Nor can I.
I might get the odd  done.
Yes, I make it the other 
That's fine.
way round, I shove everything to one side of the desk and everyone's gone home and then I start working.
So, it's perhaps an area that I could instigate there.
That side of things to actually get things completed.
Okay.
That's super.
That's, that's true.
That's brilliant.
What about you two?
Oh right!
Yes.
We're both er, inquisitive, and  enthusiastic, strong, strong-willed, er  we both  top score in that  source investigator.
Right.
Yeah.
That's what I heard, pretending .
That's right.
That's alright.
We're both, yeah we're both  try and demand respect, we both try and help people with weakness as much as possible.
Both , self-confident.
We try and mould our ideas that we both have together  what we get them from other people.
 
That's alright.
I'm impressed.
 
I do , I, I don't , I told you that th that there ain't many, many players in this world who are, who are so so , sort of, you know started what 
Yeah.
they did, they nick everybody else's ideas and turn them into something else so  well 
Well like we, so we can try and e , with regards to the teams we're probably a little bit more high profile than a lot of the other teams.
Yeah.
At our depot, because it's just the way, just the way we are up north.
A , and your reputation .
Well no, er I've been there a few times.
Yeah.
And er so  but we have divided it by the weaknesses and things like that.
Are what?
Planning.
Right .
Yes, that won't be a strength will it?
No.
No.
Yeah.
That's what we've gotta finish tomorrow.
 
Right, well everybody's, we gotta finish tomorrow.
I know.
Yeah.
God almighty!
Er , we're not  we're not all so self-disc , or 
 
disciplined about things.
Right.
It takes the way things go instead of just making, yeah, instead of just sitting down and getting on with it.
Well one of the problems you see,i if you are perceived as one of the best, you tend to be in the top three or four or so on, you know, the, the  people know who you are, but when you are perceived as being the, you know, that sort of effort you sort of find it, find it pretty difficult .
And  it's only the people who become, well I mean, I was gonna say sort of gold medallists and the Olympics who are  good at that sort of thing because  the best in the world, yeah.
And they don't give them to everybody, what you do is,th the problem is that you see all that's wrong with the depot.
Yeah.
Now they  er  you know it's a bit of a bloody, bloody dowdy operation, I mean er, one of the things I try and talk to people about here
Yeah.
and er, I get on the courses is the fact that that is very good attendance sort of thing for you to see T N T Express has been  rather than a depot.
You never see a truck here.
How many times does anybody see them?
They're all gone by the time you get into work and they ain't back by time you go home.
Do you ever see a truck?
No.
Have you ever seen the type of thing?
No.
Well, rarely.
And so that this tendency you see for us to see how well our world has been, rather than the depot, and in many cases they do it
Mm.
they .
Mm.
Now, what you've got to do, the one thing you really have got to do is to, is is to start being critical of yourselves and well look, am I doing anything wrong here?
But rather than have you doing something else.
Mm mm.
Mm.
And also we, we, we need to look at strict plans as I say, because we're not  particularly good, good at that.
Yeah.
So you'll go away 
 
and find that out?
Yeah.
Yeah, well you better go and ask Stuart.
Yeah.
And if  you just think, oh well.
You're talking to me , you're talking to the first one round.
following a plan, and a system many, many times.
Alright, what about Jane cos she's looking at us?
I'm a 
Well er, er yeah, but it's 
But er, which is worse.
that's right,.
The one thing we are gonna do is, is aim to do is concentrate on, on 
 
obviously not now.
Erm, it's, if  is a bit awkward bu , you know, our, well our terms because you know how calls so Jenny gets to have them, she gets an awful lot.
Alright, well th th that's  that's okay.
Oh yeah.
Lynn does.
Yeah.
Yeah.
What about Jack the lad?
Mm mm.
Er, there's, there's, there's gotta be a distraction between what you're, many of the figures made there 
No, that's right.
erm, of the three of us.
Er  on the, the S E H, which is the erm, the organizer 
The short one.
Right.
We, we all came out fairly high on that one.
And do you think that, that fits?
Does that gel with what you see 
Yeah.
in your company?
Yeah.
Erm
Where you work.
I think we, we, we fairly, we're fairly organized  as a team now.
And, as I say, we've been together for a long time and  the appointment, the changeover of the appointments 
Can I stop you?
Yes.
Was the help, helping you pick up body language there?
They both moved back 
Mm mm.
together and they both move up.
One knee was right over left 
 
and the other was left over right.
 
Yeah I noticed that.
Erm, I stopped doing  that but 
 
she 
That was  Peter.
Peter.
You got about seven hours tonight I'll tell you about it.
We slept through that one last time.
Oh very funny.
Who gave you a ?
Right go on, I'm sorry, I shouldn't have stopped you.
Go on.
I've slept with worse than that before Pete.
Ooh!
Everything's hunky-dory and I never hope I ever knock this, I don't know whether Susan wants to hear this but since we started doing 
 
the appointment side it really 
 
in our depot, it's really working.
And erm
I presume so.
we've got a very, very 
Yeah.
good rapport with each, you know, we can sort o , I mean the girls can sort of say what they want to me, I say what I want to them, you know, we take a joke.
Oh that's nice.
We got a lot of er
we got very good rapport going which is a big thing.
I don't think the other team in the depot have got such a, I shouldn't speak out of school but we have 
Ah that's okay.
got such a good rapport with the outdoor sales than I've got with er, Jane and Linda.
Right.
Which I think goes a long way.
Yeah.
So what would, what would be the weakness of the team then?
Er, well we wrote ta erm, a couple of weaknesses down here.
 
Erm, the weakness of the team was erm
You're not allowed to say those.
Yeah, we need to brush up on, on er 
And I'll have these.
making changes beyond ourselves.
Erm
Ooh God!
any
Ha!
Well based on what 
That one's 
we need to brush 
change that one 
up on erm
Yes, we need to brush up on, on analysing our problems before they get worse and getting them back into shape using our organized, organizing skills and teamwork.
Right.
And has 
Plus 
that  go on.
plus erm, we, we sort of erm  we need to get together more in the night and be brief, we'd be briefing  
I was just gonna say, what you need, probably, is to
We
er i is to  not meet for meeting's sake.
Yeah.
And one of the things we need to talk about tomorrow is how we put together a briefing 
Yeah.
I think, and, or a de-brief, what the hell do we do with this thing.
Erm, and that I would have thought would probably do it, or certainly helpful as long as you actually do it, sort of thing.
One of the problems 
Yeah.
with de-briefings is that what people do is sit down and say what shall we talk about now?
That's right.
Or what, on the night we have a chat with that area being on on that day
Right.
individually, but we don't get together enough as a team.
No.
Oh.
Just sit down 
The three of us.
for half an hour
The three of us.
 
That's what it takes.
That's what it takes.
Yeah.
I agree.
It's just me or Jack
Yeah.
her or Jack.
Yeah.
Well it should be the three of us more.
Yes.
Just that  since we've come back after Christmas we haven't  never have the time before er 
Oh well let's well 
to get together, all together, it's  we just haven't
I'm sure, ah but with respect 
 
I'm sure you have had the time, what you don't do is make the time because 
Yeah.
Yeah.
you've got too many other things 
That's right.
to do.
Exactly, exactly right.
Mm.
And it's, er  it is one of the problems.
That goes to the bottom of 
Yes.
the pile.
That's right.
One of the problems you see is that 
Yeah.
that people tend to see  a meeting as having to be  really, oh it's gotta be at ten to five, it's gotta 
You gotta say .
be on a Friday
Yeah.
or whatever it may be.
And,i , no the only reason for having Friday meetings is because it's Friday.
Yeah.
There ain't any, no reason for it.
We a , but we are on a regular day er
Just stopped them.
Sales
depot sales meetings so, on a regular basis now  erm, including Jeff who's the general manager.
All teams will go through a meeting about six, every eight weeks.
We've put a lot of erm
Yeah, I think that's what that, that's 
managers,wo , a lot of ma the managers, a lot of the customers now you know, can come depot 
it was said that er 
you know, and it's  being done and everything wants starting, and so on and so on.
Right.
So er, we're on, now on our last 
You can't 
erm  comes out each week brought up each week at erm  depot meetings.
Right.
There's a lot of competition at the moment in between our territory team and the other territory team
That's good.
where
Right.
erm, but that's what we've had the meetings in 
 
really about is we've, we've listed our major 
 
consa , customers and then  listed their's, and the two gets  first one and the most revenue started, that's what we're having at the moment.
Having a little competition in between us both, you know.
Yeah.
Well the great thing that you've 
And it's 
got going for you now of course, is you have a very, or a fairly good idea of what you're strong at  and what you are weak at, or what you, one part of the weaknesses is planning things, and analysing things.
That's right.
Erm  and so what we need to think about tomorrow, we're organizing this plan, or whatever, is  how, how do we implement that.
Er, and I think what you need to do, what we all need to do is when we've discussed all this stuff, talked about it, and I'm sure you'll talk about it again tonight, that what we need to do is to recognize that this has to start on Monday.
Mm.
Not Monday week.
Mhm.
Think that 
Not Tuesday afternoon.
I think that our problem is like, that we don't sort of like  get together and  me , and I know what I; m doing with Jack, and Linda knows what she's doing with Jack, but  me and Linda don't know what each other are doing.
That's right.
And I think 
Mm.
that is, I think that's clear, I think that's  er you're absolutely right.
Mhm.
But it comes up and I'll say, oh did I not say that?
That's right.
Did you?
Aha.
Didn't I tell you that?
Aha.
Didn't I tell you that?
And I just 
And it is 
presumed, you know.
Is it going down did you say?
Yeah.
Erm 
You presume that each other knows when really
That's right.
you don't.
Oh tell me about it.
Yeah.
Right.
I never worked with anybody like that but I know who you mean.
Come on then!
Oh.
There are some places where we keep the best till last.
Thanks.
Serves me right for  I suppose.
Yes.
That's right.
So what, what, what are now?
What are we  what are we now?
Erm  they would ideally like to
Right.
I haven't said something by the way.
Oh yes.
Yeah.
Mary's quite good coming up with new ideas and  new lines of thought  on various subjects 
Right.
Okay.
and I'm, supposedly the one that will  carry it through.
I er 
And do you think that's right?
Yeah.
Yeah I think so.
And she's also good at  support, supporting the team.
Right.
Ah erm  and her loyalty to the company, so  she's always saying
I think you've all got that, it's just that er I don't think that 
yes, yeah, oh yeah.
Okay, right.
Ah ah, and and also a good problem solver as well.
That Mary will come across with something that you use on
Mm mm.
various ideas.
The weakness that we've identified is that  because we're new  we haven't learnt the game.
We've gotta learn the game.
Yeah.
From the 
Yeah.
type of
area to
I wish I could live 
as much 
in a world where none of you learnt the bloody
then we can actually get on with it.
But erm  yes, I, I think there's the, the, there's a weakness and a strength there you see.
And a, one of the reasons why Mary keeps coming out with good ideas is she don't know the game.
Mm mm.
And, one of the days she'll learn the game, I mean that in the nicest sense, the,th th , the game, and when she learns the game she'll stop coming out with ideas then.
Mm.
We'll be .
A , and, and I think we all do that.
The erm  but most of us are  when yo , when you first join something  you can always see the things that you ought to be able to change.
And one of the things that is happening and mortified when I first came to this company was I couldn't see a straight line through.
I couldn't see who reported to who.
I can't, I still don't bloody know now!
But I mean I 
 
I I just couldn't, I just thought, suddenly I thought my God, you know I can change this.
So 
It's not so much changing T N T, it was changing some influences that's effecting Mary.
She's doing, spending as much time doing tea  and she sees, as she is phoning prospects.
Yes.
I think that shows in time.
Yeah.
That's what, I think one of the other ones is, whilst we
No it's alright to laugh, I go round picking  up.
That's right.
Once again we 
Yeah I know.
de-brief every now and then, it's  it's not being a full de-brief.
I'll tell Alison the accountant then, and she'll tell me what she's  sold and  how many contracts we've booked and  but it's done in front of everybody else while everybody, why everybody else who's on the phone.
And we don't talk about problems, who's done what, how, what problems you're having.
Mm mm.
And they haven't done anything in a, in a support group  in that sense.
But like just for you to know that, I mean,at the moment, got a slight shortage of staff and, us little Express girlies are like, we're all sort of desperate to please them well, and because we need to, if a customer rings we're always there for them  and the problem is, I've got like two phones on my desk at the moment, so, I could guarantee the minute I put my phone down, if anybody else is on the phone  ha,bloody phone's still ringing , I have got to answer it.
There is times I've casually picked it up, dropped it on the floor and forgotten to pick it up for a while because I'm on the phone and sometimes it is quite loud in my ear.
But like, looking at this is what did it, filling 
Well 
in this.
Actually sitting there and saying, not realizing, a few problems that 
Too busy to realize 
I'm writing.
So I've looked at it at the end of day and thought well  my God!
And he's looked at it and just said  well look at it.
Don't spend 
But you see the 
as much on the phone .
th ,th again , again you see the strength of this course is that if nobody had actually given you time like, you'd have never known.
No.
This is it.
You just get on with what you're doing.
We had a secretary here a fortnight ago and said how good it'd been.
So manic.
It was .
Oh!
You wouldn't know, you see.
No.
And and, the, the, the strength of this particular course amazed with herself she just sort of sat about once a day chatting .
 
But, the strength of this particular is that we now know an awful lot of about one another.
Mm.
But we get   
We're getting there faster than we think.
We're getting there faster than we think.
Good.
Thank you for that.
Right.
I'm now gonna give you one last exercise then  which  may take rather more time than we've got.
And if it doesn't, probably won't, we'll be kicking away from here about quarter five.
If it does, then okay  finish it off tonight.
Or, do it before then.
I want to give you  I'm going to give each of you, yeah if you just wanna just clear up some of the bits of paper then that's alright.
Yeah.
Cos you can't get, an old bloke told me that.
Okay, one for you  and one for you.
One for you.
One for you.
And one for you.
Right, what I want you to do, and we've used the same two teams as we, we've used last time.
Right?
So it's from Jenny that way, and from Matt that way.
Okay?
All I want you to do  I'll just read through this.
You've just been told that you are to take over the job of manager for O A Z Company Limited.
The previous 
 
job holder has resigned and left the country.
They always do.
And they th , they not only leave the country, they're up in space, you can't get hold of them, in fact, he's not at work.
And the only key members of the department are away on leave, okay?
It will be the same.
And you can't get hold of any of them.
Okay?
So who's down to?
You.
You know very little about the job.
Right?
But understand that your new boss is the production director.
Right?
Mr .
You've got two chief managers, Mr  and Mr .
And a secretary, Elma, who'll report straight into you.
Ooh ooh!
You've got forty minutes, that's about what you've got, it's just about thirty minutes, okay?
To clear the items found on your predecess
