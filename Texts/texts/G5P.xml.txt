We could put you on something on a regular basis to help to damp them down.
Mm.

No as as I say Doctor, I don't Same as I was on the valium, you know 
Yeah.
what I mean, I I I don't know whether that's a throwback Doctor from er being on them, I don't know.
I think they call them flash backs don't they or something .
Yes, that's right.
But as I say I cope alright with them and as I say Doctor, I always seem as though I wake up with one, do you 
Yeah.
understand what I mean, so 
Well 
it must be in my dreams or
Or what we could do, if you say these this dose makes you a bit drowsy, we could give you the same stuff but in a lower dose.
Mm.
And see if that will help without actually making you
You feel too dopey .
feel flaccid, as you say.


Is that okay, shall we try a lower dose?
Yes please.
Now if you find the lower dose isn't working then we can always go back to

What this dose again?
Yes please.
