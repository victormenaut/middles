NORTH YORKSHIRE MOORS RAILWAY SILVER JUBILEE 1967–1992
YORKSHIRE MOORS BY LINER
Take a trip into a gentler age on the North Yorkshire Moors Railway.
Step aboard our steam train, settle in your seat and enjoy an everchanging landscape on the eighteen miles from Grosmont to Pickering.
To enjoy the best the Railway has to offer, travel in spring, when wild flowers peek through fresh green embankments.
Or in autumn when purple moorland takes on a blanket of golden patchwork.
There is much to discover at each of our stations.
PICKERING is a bustling market town in the heart of rural Ryedale.
Within yards of the station, you can catch trout for tea, sup Yorkshire ale, and see how things used to be at Beck Isle Museum of Rural Life.
The first stop on the way north is LEVISHAM , a cluster of railway buildings lying in the valley between Newton upon Rawcliffe and Levisham itself.
Here the signalman also sells the tickets!
At NEWTONDALE HALT peace and tranquillity greet you in this dale where no cars can go.
But do tell the Guard you want to get off there — and more important — don't miss the last train back!
A gem of a country station awaits you at GOATHLAND complete with cast-iron footbridge and colourful gardens.
It really is the heart of the North York Moors, and just the place to explore walks and waterfalls.
Stretch your legs on the trackbed of George Stephenson's original route to Grosmont, now known as the Historical Railway Trail.
GROSMONT SHED is the place to find steam locos of all colours, shapes and sizes.
Go there first thing to see the engines prepared for the daily shift, or watch restoration from our Viewing Gallery.
At GROSMONT stoke up on mouthwatering meals and snacks in Signals , our Tea Room on Platform 2.
Change here for Whitby and the seaside!
Take time to browse in our Station Shops at Pickering, Goathland and Grosmont.
You'll find fascinating books and guides to help you make the most of your day, as well as gifts for family and friends.
Refreshments are available at those stations too, as well as on most trains.
If dining aboard a steam train is a long cherished ambition, dreams can come true aboard The North Yorkshireman .
Book your table for dinner on the diner which runs at least once a week from spring to autumn.
Come along and celebrate our Silver Jubilee in 1992!
Twenty-five years ago, the line built by George Stephenson in 1836 was saved from closure and took on a new lease of life as the North Yorkshire Moors Railway.
Nowadays a quarter of a million passengers journey each year on the spectacular 18 miles between Pickering and Grosmont.
Travel in our Silver Jubilee year and enjoy the freedom of the Railway when you buy an All-line ticket.
Break your journey, take a picnic, or follow a way-marked walk.
During the whole anniversary season, buy a Family Ticket (2 adults and 2 children aged 5–16 years) and spend a whole day exploring the Railway for only £19!
It will be even cheaper for two adults and one child, and free for four year olds and under!
Our Adult All-line tickets have been held at 1991 Standard rates and Over 60's can enjoy even greater benefits — 33% off all fares.

On Wednesdays in July and August, steam to Levisham for 10.48 and a 3 mile walk with a pub stop, or Newtondale for 14.43 (15.14 green days) and a different three miles — although your ticket is valid for both if you wish!

The Keighley and Worth Valley Railway is…
a five-mile branch line linking the town of Keighley, on the Leeds-Settle-Carlisle main line, with the villages of Oakworth, Haworth and Oxenhope.
The Railway was built by a company formed mainly of local mill owners and opened in 1867.
It became part of the Midland and later the London Midland and Scottish railways until nationalisation in 1948 when it was operated by British Railways.
The line closed in 1961.
The Railway was purchased by The Keighley and Worth Valley Railway Preservation Society, formed by people who wished to re-open the line, which they did in 1968.
Since then the Railway has provided a steam train service EVERY weekend and daily during the summer.
As well as operating trains (which carry over 150,000 passengers p.a.), the entire Railway, engines, coaches, track, stations and equipment, have all been restored from total dereliction to their present condition, a remarkable example of what can be achieved by qualified volunteers.
Come and share Britain's only and lasts surviving ‘Complete Branch Line Railway.’

OPERA NORTH spring season 1992
the thieving magpie
GIOACHINO ROSSINI
Farcical yet passionate with music that is both witty and sensitive, Opera North celebrates the composer's bicentenary in style.
Best known for the infectious overture, the whole of The Thieving Magpie is vintage Rossini.
The opera is newly translated by Jeremy Sams whose recent translation of L'Etoile had audiences rocking with laughter, and designed by Sue Blane known for her outrageous costumes in the wacky cult opera The Love For Three Oranges .
SUNG IN ENGLISH
the performance lasts approximately 3 hours 15 minutes 
rigoletto
GIUSEPPE VERDI
Verdi combines drama and music in this macabre yet passionate melodrama.
The story of the revenge-seeking jester Rigoletto and his possessive love for his daughter is swiftly carried on Verdi's universally popular melodies.
Rigoletto returns to Opera North's repertory after an absence of 10 years in an entirely new staging which will evoke the decadent splendour of the Mantuan court.
SUNG IN ITALIAN
original text by Francesco Maria Piave
the performance lasts approximately 2 hours 30 minutes
production sponsored by YORKSHIRE TELEVISION 
boris godunov
MODEST MUSSORGSKY
John Tomlinson makes a welcome return as the anguished Tsar following his recent success as Attila .
Opera North's 1989 production of Mussorgsky's original seven-scene version of Boris Godunov was, by general consensus, regarded as a supreme achievement of Opera North's first decade.
This is opera on a grand scale with the overwhelming emotion that only choral singing can command.

more about the magpie
Opera North's contribution to Rossini's 200th birthday celebrations is a new production of The Thieving Magpie in a new English translation by Jeremy Sams (his supremely funny translation of L'Etoile had audiences holding their sides).
Everyone knows the sparkling overture, but you can find out all about the rest of the opera, which brilliantly balances laughter and tears, at an informal Open Forum on Saturday 25 April 1992, 2.30pm–4.30pm in the Grand Hall of Leeds Grand Theatre.
Meet director Martin Duncan (remember his achingly funny double bill of L'Heure Espagnole and Gianni Schicchi ?), designer Sue Blane, whose wonderfully witty costumes helped to make The Love For Three Oranges an award-winning success, and translator Jeremy Sams.

The City Waites provocatively flout the ‘usual’ conventions of an early music concert as the audience are whisked forward from the Court of Henry VIII to the bawdy ballads of a Drury Lane coffee house, through the idealistic love songs of the 13th-century troubadours and on to the Renaissance.
Event 11 PALLADIAN ENSEMBLE
‘FRIENDS AND RIVALS’
The Palladian Ensemble are winners of the 1991 Early Music Centre Young Artists Competition.
Their programme is built around the friendships, rivalries, correspondence and music of four of the 18th-century's most successful and prolific composers — Telemann, Handel, Bach and Bononcini.
Event 12 A WALK AROUND MEDIEVAL YORK led by Warwick Burton
Meet outside St Olave's Church, Marygate   
Event 13 GRUPPO MAGRICALISTICO ‘FOSCO CORTI’
BANCHIERI ‘LA PAZZIA SENILE’
The ‘Fosco Corti’ Madrigal Ensemble was founded in 1986 to study Renaissance madrigals.
Winners of the Luca Marenzio International Madrigal Competition in 1989, ‘Fosco Corti’ have given concerts throughout Europe.
This concert marks the British debut of this acclaimed Italian ensemble.
Event 14 MONTEVERDI, MANTUA AND THE GONZAGA FAMILY
Monteverdi's 1610 Music for Vespers was written while at the Gonzaga court.
Dr Graham Dixon makes some suggestions about its Mantuan context and its possible connection with the patroness of the family, St Barbara.
—
Event 15 YORKSHIRE BACH CHOIR YORKSHIRE BAROQUE SOLOISTS
CLAUDIO MONTEVERDI ‘VESPERS MUSIC OF 1610’
Set in the context of Second Vespers for the Feast of St Barbara
The feast of St Barbara was the major religious and political celebration of the Mantuan year.
This performance is based on Graham Dixon's suggestion that Monteverdi's 1610 Vespers music may have been the result of his involvement in the celebrations.

MADRIGALS OF MONTEVERDI AND MARENZIO
A selection of madrigals from two of the leading composers in the field — performed by these remarkable Italian madrigal specialists.
Event 20 ‘L'ORFEO: BEHIND THE MASK’
So much has been written about Monteverdi's L'Orfeo that it may be difficult to believe that many of the puzzles can be answered through a study of Renaissance humanistic traditions.
Philip Pickett, director of The New London Consort, considers the significance of astrology, magic and Marsilio Ficino; Orfeo as a singer of arias; the lost art of improvising to the lira; and the symbolism of all the ritornelli.
Event 21 NEW LONDON CONSORT
VERGENE BELLA — MUSIC FOR ISABELLA D'ESTE
Mantuan frottole of every kind by Cara and Tromboncino, including settings by Petrarch and Michelangelo.
Isabella d'Este, was not merely an enthusiastic instrument collector and patroness of the arts but also an accomplished singer, lutenist and keyboard player.
The programme will include tantalising glimpses into some of the musical and speculative traditions which led to Monteverdi's Orfeo some 100 years later.

PETER KING
The way in which the slogan ‘Bird Lives’ spontaneously appeared on New York subway walls following the death of the legendary Charlie Parker is one of the well known stories of jazz.
Nearly 40 years on, the famed piece of graffiti has proved thoroughly prophetic.
The spirit of one of the greatest improvisers in jazz history is indeed very much alive today, part of a great creative alto saxophone tradition…
Phil Woods…= Jackie McClean…
Lou Donaldson…
Charles McPherson…and Britain's very own Peter King!
All of these great saxophonists have their own very distinct voices and personal approaches within the Parker tradition and Peter King is indeed no exception.
His playing is highly individual, swinging, fluent, thoroughly griping and regularly dazzling.
He is quite definitely one of the most important jazz figures to emerge this side of the Atlantic and one of that handful of European musicians to achieve ‘World Class’ status.
He was recognised as a ‘New Star’ as far back as 1960, in the days when the Melody Maker had a jazz orientation and featured an annual Jazz Poll.
He worked in a wide range of big bands including those led by John Dankworth, the late Tubby Hayes, Canadian trumpeter Maynard Ferguson and Stan Tracey, with whom he continues to play, in both big band and Octet settings.
Small group involvements include the Tony Kinsey Quartet and combos involving such Americans as Al Cohn, Nat Adderley and Zoot Sims.
He toured Britain with Ray Charles but resisted an offer of a permanent position with the band.
Peter has also worked and recorded with blues singers such as Jimmy Witherspoon and Joe Williams.
On the fringe of jazz, he continues to work regularly with Georgie Fame, Everything But The Girl and is currently working as Musical Director for the Charlie Watts Quintet.
A founder-member of the Beebop Preservation Society in the 1970's, he recorded with former Charlie Parker partner, the trumpeter Red Rodney.
During the 1980's, a series of superb Peter King Quartets and Quintets emerged of very great musical significance.
Peter King's band leading role continues in the 1990's extending his 1980's achievements, his numerous club appearances, acclaimed albums and regular poll winning triumphs.
This Northern tour teams him with some of the finest musicians to be heard outside London — Nikki Iles (Piano), Les Chisnall (Piano) Caroline Broaden (Drums) and Pete Glennon (Bass).
This is bound to be one of the highlights of 1992.
Don't miss it!

In 1934 the son of Britain's most controversial  psychoanalyst was reported killed in a climbing accident.

This  fascinating play shows the aftermath of this unexpected death and its effect on three remarkable women whilst taking a respectful yet gently mocking look at psychoanalysis.
Mrs Klein was Nicholas Wright's first play for the National Theatre in 1988.

Stephen Joseph Theatre in the Round SCARBOROUGH
Welcome
Welcome to the Stephen Joseph Theatre in the Round and another season of top class entertainment.
As ever, we open our year with a new show written and directed by our resident Artistic Director Alan Ayckbourn —Time of my Life , his 44th full-length play.
It's followed by classic American romance with Clifford Odets's Rocket to the Moon , directed by Malcolm Hebden.
Young writer Tim Firth scored a big hit here last year with the lunchtime show,A Man of Letters , so this year we've asked him to write a main house show for us — the hilarious Neville's Island .
Add to that a packed lunchtime season, and late-night entertainment in the studio on Fridays and Saturdays, and we think you'll agree that there's always something for everyone at the Stephen Joseph Theatre in the Round.
Time of my Life
Written & directed by Alan Ayckbourn
WORLD PREMIERE
MAIN HOUSE
On selected dates between 15 April and 5 August
Please see the diary at the front of this brochure for exact dates and times
When eating out, why is it that the next table's conversation is often so much more fascinating and intriguing?
It is Laura Stratton's fifty-fourth birthday.
She is out for the evening to celebrate at her favourite local restaurant.
The other guests include her businessman husband Gerry, her two sons Glyn and Adam, Glyn's wife Stephanie and Adam's new girlfriend Maureen.
Three couples celebrating a happy family outing.
Yet is it all as harmonious as it appears?
What secrets lie buried in the past?
What hidden tensions lurk beneath the present surface?
What awaits them all in the future?
What do the waiters make of it all?
Alan Ayckbourn's new comedy,Time of my Life , explores the family's lives, past, present and future in a three-way journey through time.
All of them in search of personal happiness but, as is so often the case, hard pressed to recognise it even when they find it.
We invite you to come and eavesdrop on their story.
Rocket to the Moon
By Clifford Odets Directed by Malcolm Hebden
MAIN HOUSE
On selected dates between 29 April and 15 July
Please see the diary at the front of this brochure for exact dates and times
‘An Odets play was awaited like news hot off the press, as though through him we would know what to think of ourselves and our prospects.’
Thus did Arthur Miller pay tribute to Clifford Odets, one of the greatest American writers of the 20th century.
‘Odets seemed to me to share something of Marilyn [Monroe's]perceptive naivete; like her, he was a self-destroying babe in the woods absentmindedly combing back his hair with a loaded pistol.’
With the release this year of the award-winning movie based on Odets's life,Barton Fink , his work is enjoying a new popularity.
The Stephen Joseph Theatre is proud to present the play generally considered to be his finest,Rocket to the Moon .
Set in the charged atmosphere of a thirties New York summer,Rocket to the Moon is a tale of romance, stifled sexuality and thwarted ambition…at a time when it was considered next to impossible that a rocket could reach the moon.
Neville's Island

WORLD PREMIERE
MAIN HOUSE
On selected dates between 10 June and 9 September
Please see the diary at the front of this brochure for exact dates and times
Four slightly overweight, middle-aged businessmen are sent off on a team-building exercise in the Lake District.
Misreading the clues, they head off in completely the wrong direction and manage to become the first people ever to get shipwrecked on one of the islands of Derwentwater.
Cut off from the world for a weekend, what started out as a bit of a laugh for Gordon, Angus, Roy and Neville turns into a carnival of recrimination, backbiting, French cricket and sausages.
What should have been three comfy nights in a five-star hotel with en-suite jacuzzis turns into a full-blooded, mud-covered fight for survival.
Trapped by the elements, menaced by the wildlife, this team-building exercise ends up being a demolition job.
Because when the night sets in, strange things happen out in the wilds.
And what took place on Neville's Island that foggy November weekend, no-one who witnessed it would ever forget…
Knife, Folk and Spoon
STUDIO 
Please see local press for weekly details
Why not start the week by joining one of our Monday folk sessions, at which we aim to present the best of folk from North Yorkshire.
In recent years, folk music has shed its woolly jumper and finger-in-the-ear image and reached a new audience which appreciates its wide range of styles and influences.
So sit back and enjoy a weekly helping of fine music in the relaxed atmosphere of our Square Cat Bistro, with different artistes each Monday.
A Bigger Slice of the Pie
By Tim Firth
Directed by Connal Orton
WORLD PREMIERE
STUDIO 
Angie does meat and veg, Brenda does puddings.
That's normally the way it is, sometimes they swap.
But tonight they're doing neither.
Tonight there's a do on at the plastic industrial lettering factory in Batley.
And tonight is the first time the two girls have ever gone past the ground floor.
In fact, they've gone right to the top.
But as the party rages on in the next office, a private little film show of Brenda's holiday slides starts to throw lights on some dark secrets.
And this high up, that's the last thing you want.
Because, like your parents always told you, you should never play dangerous games when you're close to a big drop.
Village Wooing
By George Bernard Shaw
Directed by Malcolm Hebden
STUDIO 
Mr A: Everyman thinks that every woman that steps into a railway carriage may be the right woman.
But she is always a disappointment.
Miss Z: Same with the women, isn't it?
If you were a woman you'd know.
Mr A and Miss Z find it difficult to agree on anything — especially love and romance.
Will they ever find common ground?
George Bernard Shaw's gentle comedy, written in 1933, is a tender and touching tale of the battle between the sexes — with locations ranging from the sun-drenched deck of the pleasure ship Empress of Patagonia to a village shop on the Downs!
Apple Blossom Afternoon
By Dave Sheasby
Directed by Malcolm Hebden
WORLD PREMIERE
STUDIO 
Ted has always lived for others.
But suddenly, he's only got himself to think about, and his life can change…
Apple Blossom Afternoon is the funny and moving story of an ordinary man who takes a gamble with extraordinary results.
This is the world premiere production of a special adaptation by the author from his 1988 radio play, which won a Giles Cooper Award that year.
Square Cat Jazz
STUDIO 
Summertime, and the living is easy…
Join us each Friday lunchtime in the Square Cat Bistro for a mouthwatering menu of swinging summer jazz, accompanied by good food and drink.
Each week, top musicians from around the region will present a lively programme of toe-tapping jazz, with the emphasis on having a good time.
The theatre bar will be open throughout the sessions.
The Shawl
by David Mamet
Directed by Malcolm Hebden
STUDIO 
‘I see a question in your mind…
Can one raise the dead?’
Miss A turns to John, a small-time psychic, for comfort after a personal loss.
John's insights into her situation are astoundingly accurate…but is he all he seems to be?
The Shawl was written by acclaimed American author David Mamet, whose other plays include American Buffalo and Speed-the-Plow .
For the big screen, he has scripted The Postman Always Rings Twice ,Homicide and, most recently, an adaptation of his own play,Glengarry Glen Ross .
Exhibitions In The Studio
Please note that the studio is also used as a theatre, bistro and rehearsal space, so it is often only possible to see exhibitions after 6pm.

Hamlet Makes an Exhibition of Himself
Cartoons by Harry Venning
Hamlet the out-of-work thespian pig has been appearing in a weekly strip in ‘The Stage’ since 1988.
After a lifetime of hanging around in pubs, he will spend a month hanging around the walls of the Stephen Joseph Theatre in this collection of original artwork by Harry Venning.
Textiles into Illustrations
by Viv Geen
Viv Geen graduated from the Central School of Art and Design, London, in 1983, with an honours degree in textile design.
After a recent move to North Yorkshire, and her two children having reached school age, she has resumed her interest in design.
Working mainly in water colour, her strong decorative design sense and her training in textile design are combined in a series of rich, colourful and unusual images.
Beach Bodies
Photographs by Adrian Gatie
‘They are here for the sea, sand and sun, bodies spread out in clumps and clusters on the beach.
Whether they come for the day, weekend or week they leave whatever troubles they have at home and come to lie, look and be looked at.
Radios, blankets and chairs ritually stake out a territorial claim — space for beach bodies to occupy, albeit with a tentativeness born of knowledge that strangers are just a fingertip away…’
In a conscious break from recent lengthy works such as his trilogy ‘In Penumbria’, ‘Nexus’ and ‘An Adjustment of Expectations’, in ‘Beach Bodies’Adrian Gatie glances at the summer visitors to our beaches.
Surreptitiously photographed at very close quarters he shows us moments in the sand — moments private and not so private.
Drawings and Prints
by Carolyn Smith
‘I would say the overwhelming influence on my artistic interpretation of the world has been my early training as a sculptor.
I am fascinated by the sculptural elements in nature.
Shape and form are of greater importance to me than colour, so much of my work is in black and white.
The role of the artist as I see it is to present a personal vision of the world, a vision which is the product of a search for self-knowledge.
By presenting this vision the artist hopes to reveal a different perspective and to enrich the viewer as well as herself’.

ATTRACTIONS IN Captain Cook COUNTRY 1992
WHO WAS CAPTAIN COOK?
In the annals of British maritime history there are few heroes more dazzling than Captain James Cook.
Or more likeable.
At a time when the Royal Navy was notorious for the brutality of its discipline, he maintained order by sheer force of personality.
His crews worshipped him and he responded by showing a genuine concern for their welfare.
When he completed his circumnavigation of the world, his contemporaries were just as impressed by the fact that he achieved this feat without losing a single member of his crew to scurvy.
The son of a farm labourer from Marton, James Cook was fortunate to be born into an age of great explorations.
Between 1768 and 1779, his own voyages of discovery filled in vast empty areas on the maps of his time.
He was the first to enter the Antarctic Circle, venturing further south — 71°10' — than any sailing ship before or since.
He was also first to circumnavigate the world in both directions, the first to have entered both the Arctic and Antarctic circles.
All these achievements were accomplished in sturdy ships built at Whitby.
The largest of them, the Resolution, was only 110 feet long, 30 feet 5 inches wide with a mere 462 tons burthen.
PSS WINGFIELD CASTLE AND HMS TRINCOMALEE, JACKSON DOCK, HARTLEPOOL
Maritime history is recreated at the ancient sea port of Hartlepool, for this is where old ships are brought for restoration.
The ‘Wingfield Castle’ was built in Hartlepool in 1934 and spent its working life as the Hull-New Holland ferry, or visit the HMS Trincomalee, the oldest British warship afloat, moored in the new Hartlepool Marina development.
HARTLEPOOL MARITIME MUSEUM
The traditional industries of shipbuilding, marine engineering, shipping and fishing are to be seen here, together with an important collection of ships' models.
HARTLEPOOL FISHING FESTIVALS
Hartlepool, situated at the mouth of the Tees, is a favourite haunt for sea-anglers.
Major competitions are held annually and provide sport for the participants and a colourful spectacle for the landlubber.
STOCKTON
Cook's mother was born and lived at Thornaby, now part of Stockton, until her marriage.
In Stockton Parish Church you will find a memorial to Cook.
The altarpiece is made of wood from one of his ships, the ‘Resolution’.
Thomas Sheraton, the furniture designer was born here in 1751.
In 1825 the Stockton and Darlington railway, the first passenger railway in the world, was opened.
YARM
Once an inland port on the River Tees, with cobbled High Street and Georgian buildings now providing an ‘olde worlde’ setting.
Wynds — narrow lanes — lead down to the river from both sides of the street, from Yarm is built on a loop of the river.
Marching through the centre of the town is a magnificent 42-arch railway viaduct, built in 1849.
Tom Brown, the hero of the Battle of Dettingen, and a contemporary of Cook, lived in a house in the High Street and is buried in the churchyard.
PRESTON PARK MUSEUM
Here you will be transported backwards in time as you meander through the Victorian street, with its working craftsmen, and into the period rooms showing life as it was in Victorian times.
Walk in the grounds beside the banks of the Tees and imagine sailing ships making their way up to Yarm, a major port in the 18th Century.
COOK'S SHIP ‘ENDEAVOUR’
In the Cleveland Shopping Centre in Middlesbrough you will find a one-fifth scale replica of Cook's ship ‘Endeavour’, built by shipwrights from Whitby, the heirs to the craftsmen who built the original ship in the 18th Century.
The ideal place to start or finish your exploration of Captain Cook Country.
Spend some time in this delightful compact shopping centre.
BY RAIL IN COOK COUNTRY ESK VALLEY LINE
A novel way for you to explore the area where Cook spent his formative years.
British Rail's Esk Valley Line runs between Middlesbrough and Whitby.

Break your journey at Marton for a short walk to the site where Cook was born in 1728.
THE BIRTHPLACE OF COOK
You will find an attractive granite urn dedicated to Cook by Bolckow marking the site of the cottage birthplace in Stewart Park, Marton, on the outskirts of  Middlesbrough .
James Cook was born here in 1728.
OPEN: All year from early morning to dusk.
THE CAPTAIN COOK BIRTHPLACE MUSEUM
Also in Stewart Park, next to the birthplace site, is the award-winning museum commemorating the early life and achievements of James Cook in the area, his three great voyages and the lands he visited.
THE CONSERVATORY
Walk across the terrace from the Birthplace Museum to the Conservatory, which you will find packed with many of the tropical plants which Cook and his botanist, Sir Joseph Banks would have seen on their voyages.
ST CUTHBERT'S CHURCH, MARTON
Inside this ancient church is the parish register with the entry for 3 November 1728.
‘James ye son of James Cook day labourer baptized’, as well as three memorials to Captain Cook, the earliest dated 1812.
Across the road in the centre of the village, are two stones from Points Hicks in Australia, the first place on that continent to be sighted on Cook's first great voyage.
Key available from Parish Centre.
ST.
PETER AND PAUL, STAINTON
The centrepiece of this delightful sleepy village on the outskirts of Middlesbrough the winner of a ‘Britain in Bloom’ award, is the Parish Church where James Cook Senior and Grace Pace, Cook's parents, were married in 1725.
ORMESBY HALL
This lovely old hall with stables, gardens and parkland, until recently the home of the Pennyman family and now in the care of the National Trust, was built between 1723 and 1743.
Cook's father worked for the Pennymans on the estate, and Cook spent part of his childhood here.
ST.
CUTHBERT'S CHURCH, ORMESBY
Next to Ormesby Hall and surrounded by ancient trees is the Church where Cook's elder brother, John, and one of his younger sisters were baptised.
ROSEBERRY TOPPING
Although just over 1,000 feet high this conical hill, once described as ‘Cleveland's Matterhorn’, dominates the Cleveland skyline.
Take the easy path to the summit from the car park at Newton-under-Roseberry and admire the magnificent panoramic views of coast and countryside, just as Cook himself must have done when he lived at Aireyholme Farm below the summit.
CAPTAIN COOK'S SCHOOLROOM MUSEUM, GREAT AYTON
The museum, displaying items related to Cook and features of 18th Century Great Ayton, is in the very building where young James went to school.
It was then the poor house and charity school of the village.
Of his time here it is recorded that ‘the seeds of that undaunted resolution and perseverance…were conspicuous.’
THE COOK FAMILY COTTAGE GREAT AYTON
At the opposite end of the village from the schoolroom, an open space, marked by a granite memorial from Point Hicks, indicates the spot where Cook's father built his retirement cottage.
The cottage was transported (creeper and all!) to Australia in 1934 and now stands in Fitzroy Gardens, Melbourne.
ALL SAINTS CHURCH, GREAT AYTON AND CAPTAIN'S SKOTTOWE'S HOUSE
A short stroll across the pretty River Leven will take you into the Church where the Cook family worshipped.
Look in the churchyard at the south east corner of the church and you will find a poignant tombstone, grave of Cook's mother, brothers and sisters.
Next to the church is Ayton Hall, home of Cook's benefactor, Thomas Skottowe.
MOUNT GRACE PRIORY
At the foot of the Cleveland Hills, close the A19, nestles Mount Grace Priory.
In this well preserved late 14th Century Carthusian Monastery you can see the monks' cells, church, stables and brew house.
The priory guest house displays archaeological finds and a history of the Order.
GISBOROUGH PRIORY, GUISBOROUGH
The imposing remains of this 12th century Augustinian priory, founded by Robert de Brus, the ancestor of Robert Bruce, King of Scotland, dominate the market town of Guisborough.
Only four miles from his home of Airyholme Farm, Cook must have visited the market here many times, just as you can each Thursday and Saturday.
TOCKETTS MILL
Just outside Guisborough on the road to Upleatham is Cleveland's last working water mill.
You will see flour being milled here just as it was in Captain Cook's day.
Why not drop in and buy some?
THE TINY UPLEATHAM CHURCH
Near to Marske you will find Upleatham Church, built in the 12th Century.
Delightfully situated in open country just outside Upleatham village, it is reputed to be England's smallest church, measuring just 17ft. 9in. by 13ft.
KIRKLEATHAM ‘OLD HALL’ MUSEUM
This charming period building has been a free school, public lending library and home for local gentry since 1710.
Today, it is a fine museum with many paintings of Cook country, an aviary and a children's playground.
RNLI ZETLAND MUSEUM REDCAR
The home of the world's oldest surviving lifeboat tells us much about the maritime traditions of Captain Cook Country.
The ‘Zetland’ was built by Henry Greathead in 1800 and saved over 500 lives in her 78 years of service.
ST.
GERMAIN'S CHURCHYARD, MARSKE
At the age of 77, Cook's father left Great Ayton and went to live with his daughter Margaret at Redcar.
It was here that he died in March 1779 and laid to rest beside the sea in the churchyard at Marske.
Only the tower of this church remains, a few yards west of which can be found Cook Senior's last resting place, marked curiously by a stone commemorating a boy who died at sea.

THE MOORS CENTRE, DANBY
The National Park exhibition centre will give you a warm welcome.
There is a children's play area and 13 acres of riverside, meadow and woodland walks to enjoy.
STAITHES
James Cook came to this fishing village, situated on the edge of the cliffs, when he was 17 years old to work for William Sanderson in his sea-front haberdashers shop.
Sanderson was a friend of Skottowe and probably recommended him for the job.
Find the rebuilt shop near the sea with its commemorative plaque.
HINDERWELL CHURCH
The Church of Hinderwell (St. Hilda's Well) is where James attended services during his stay at Staithes.
In the Churchyard you will find the tomb of his employer William Sanderson.
THE CLEVELAND WAY NATIONAL TRAIL
The best way to see Captain Cook Country is on foot.
The Cleveland Way runs in a gigantic 107 mile horseshoe from Helmsley, north to Saltburn, then south along the coast to Filey.
The central portion, the 30 odd miles, from Kildale to Whitby, will enable you to walk the very paths which Cook used in his youth.
It winds its way past Captain Cook's Monument on Easby Moor, above Aireyholme Farm, Roseberry Topping, Guisborough Moor and Saltburn.
Then along the highest sea cliffs in England to Staithes and from there to Whitby.
Cook country all the way!
NORTH YORK MOORS NATIONAL PARK
Much of the Captain Cook Heritage Trail will take you through our National Park, 553 square miles of moorland, dale, river and coastline.

Cape Cleveland and Cleveland Bay in Australia were named by Cook.
We have Cleveland Bay's too.
They're horses!
See them and lots of wildlife; as you explore Cook Country.
CAPTAIN COOK MONUMENT
At the edge of Whitby's West Cliff you will find a fine bronze statue of Captain Cook, looking out to sea.
this commemorates not only Cook, but the men who built the Whitby ships, and those who sailed in them.
For it was Whitby built ships ‘Endeavour’, ‘Resolution’, ‘Adventure’ and ‘Discovery’which Cook used on his great voyages.

A MOORLAND FESTIVAL OF THE ARTS AND THE SACRED
‘Art is a harmony parallel to nature’ Paul Cézanne
Once again this year the quiet Moorland Village of Grosmont hosts this unique Festival.
Unlike any other ‘Arts’ Festival, there is a particular ethos of reverencing the creative act.
For the organisers this is symbolised by locating as many of the various workshops, displays and performances within the sacred space of St. Matthew's Church.
The building itself and the woodland environs remain an inspiration to all artists and to all art form.
There are several newcomers to help us celebrate the mingling of what is creative and what is spiritual.
Tom Weld, from Dorset, and widely travelled, is a painter who will help us explore the beginnings of elemental creation.
This theme will be expanded by Frances Needham and Jonathan Reid in dance, whilst there will be explorations too into the healing and harmony that expressed creativity can bring to the soul.
Children are invited again by Anne Blackwell to submit work on the idea ‘Where is God?
In the wind, the fire, the earthquake, or in the still, small voice.’
Enquiries for this on (0947) 85442.
The Sunday Eucharist is a time for great thanksgiving, and each day at 12.00 noon a time of prayer and silence will be kept.
(More information is available on request)
For workshops, as there may be limited spaces, please book early by using the attached booking slip.
A Privilege Pass is available for all events at a price of £20.00 (Concessions £15.00)— but please indicate which workshops you wish to attend.
Creche facilities will be available.

Ladies Night tells of Craig, Barry, Norm, Wes and Gavin, who decide to take up stripping as a way of earning a few extra pennies.
Their act, however, known as ‘The Raging Rhinos’, can only be described as one of the seven sexless wonders of the world — definitely more comic than seductive!
That was before they met Glenda.
The lads with her help, learn all about the art of stripping, and their astounding success in their new-found careers almost ends in tears — but not before some hilarious moments lead to the climax of the play where everyone certainly gets everything (or more) than they bargained for!

ON GOLDEN POND
In this heart-warming play, an elderly couple spend the summer, as they have done for many years, at their lakeside home in Maine.
He is quirky and difficult; she loving and understanding.
When their daughter, never at ease with her father, comes to celebrate his eightieth birthday, she arrives with her current admirer and his young son.
The old man and the young boy go fishing and a strong bond develops between them.
The relationship, born on Golden Pond, gradually and mysteriously touches everyone else.
On Golden Pond has been made into an Oscar winning film, starring Katherine Hepburn, Henry Fonda and Jane Fonda.

‘A Murder Has Been Arranged’— by Emlyn Williams
A haunted theatre is the setting for this exciting and atmospheric thriller from the author of ‘Night Must Fall’.
There is a legend, born out of a murder once committed at the St. James' Theatre, that if anyone else should be murdered there a dumb woman will appear on stage to reveal the murderer.
Sir Charles Jasper, an authority on the occult, has chosen this theatre in which to hold a dinner party to celebrate the fact that at eleven o'clock that night he will come into a fortune — but if he dies before eleven his nephew, Maurice, will inherit instead.
When Maurice arrives as an unexpected guest, strange events are set in motion — a murder occurs, and a ghost appears!

Their shock turns to amazement however when Max walks in, very much alive.
This begins a sequence of events involving the C.I.D., the C.I.A., the security services and a terrorist organisation.
Before long Max finds himself caught up in a highly dangerous situation, where no-one is quite what they seem.
‘Peril At End House’— by Agatha Christie
Poirot and his friend, the faithful Captain Hastings, are staying at the Hotel Majestic in Cornwall.
However their peace is short-lived when they meet the charming Nick Buckley, the last of a long line of Buckleys inhabiting ‘End House’, which is poised in isolation on a rocky point visible from the hotel.
When Poirot tells her that Hastings has remarked that the house looked haunted she assures them that if there is a ghost it must be a friendly one, because she has had three escapes from death in as many days so she must bear a charmed life.
Poirot's ‘little grey cells’ start to work overtime, and with Hastings in tow he sets out to unmask the peril at ‘End House’.
‘Towards Zero’— by Agatha Christie

The performance lasts approximately 2 hours 50 minutes.
rigoletto
Returning this autumn is the ever-popular story of the revenge seeking jester Rigoletto and his possessive love for his daughter.
This macabre, yet passionate melodrama is swiftly carried on Verdi's immortal melodies.
the marriage of figaro
Flirtation, intrigue, the tangling of human emotions and Beaumarchais's wicked sense of humour inspired Mozart to compose some of the greatest music for the stage.

THE STORY OF SOOTY
IT'S MAGIC!
GROWING UP WITH SOOTY
A magical tour for all the family
Magic and mystery, mischief and mayhem — that's SOOTY!
Remember poor Harry Corbett?
Bathed in batter, soaked in suds and covered in clay —‘ambushed’ a thousand times by Sooty and his scheming friends, Sweep and Soo!
And Matthew…poor Matthew !— even now he's being chased from pillar to post, on stage and TV at home and abroad — to satisfy the cuddly trio's craving for mischief and mayhem!
Well…
Sooty, Sweep and Soo and Harry and Matthew too invite you all to take a peep behind the cameras and the curtains into their world of memories and magic.
SOOTY'S WORLD at Windhill in Shipley, Bradford is now Sooty's official home.
Here, you will be able to follow Sooty's rise to super-stardom through the sets, props, scripts, photos and films which have enthralled the very young and the very old! for 40 years.
Sooty first starred on TV in 1952.
One of his ‘sets’ was a fish and chip shop now on show at Windhill Manor.
That first set marked the beginning of a unique partnership lasting 20 years, between Harry Corbett and his model maker the late Bill Garrett.
And those amazing sets, with their incredible special effects (a tiny saxophone for example which costs more than the real thing!) were so treasured by Harry and Matthew that they were kept safely in storage until now !
SOOTY'S WORLD is the permanent exhibition of those unique items many of which are brought to life by detailed animation.
Humorous memories of childhood long forgotten along with the appeal of a modern television character.
So IZZY WIZZY let's get busy at SOOTY'S WORLD — fun for all the family.
Did you know that Harry Corbett was born in Bradford and met Sooty on Blackpool Pier?
And, Sooty's ears were yellow and not black?
Do you know that Sooty is our longest running children's TV show, according to the Guinness Book of Records?
SOOTY AT SCHOOL
SOOTY'S WORLD is designed as an education resource as well as a place of fun!
Its base is a beautifully restored former school, where Harry once staged his show.
You will be able to explore those formative years when Sooty played an important role in the development of children's entertainment.
And trace the history of Harry Corbett and his successor Matthew Corbett.
Continually expanding and improving this exhibition preserves the unique history of a character who can teach without saying a word.
SOOTY SOUVENIRS
Don't forget to visit Sooty's own shop before you leave.
Soft toys, puppets, videos, games together with lots of exciting Sooty books, toys and magic wands, which make smashing presents.

‘An island out of time’
Quite literally ‘an island out of time’, this water-powered mill sits marooned between the River Aire, which drives the wheels, and the Aire and Calder Navigation.
Two great swishing wheels continually drive a mass of cogs and grinding wheels which crushed stone for putty and paint throughout the nineteenth century.
This was the hub of a tiny island community with cottages, crops and gardens.
The Georgian mill owner's house has been restored and houses displays exploring the history of the mill.

English Heritage PLACES IN HISTORY
Introducing England's Historic Landmarks
VISITING ENGLAND'S HISTORY
In spite of its small size, England possesses rich evidence of its history which can be found extensively throughout the country.
Wherever you travel, you will find you are never far from buildings, monuments and ruins that stand as testimony to earlier times.
These tangible remains bear witness to the development of history in England over centuries.
They tell a story that reaches back to neolithic man some 5,000 years ago, to the Roman occupation, to the many religious and military influences and the continuing threat of invasion over the years.
The display of wealth and power and the pure delight in architecture too, have all found expression in historic buildings and their surroundings.
English Heritage is an organisation whose duty is to preserve this historic environment.
A visit to any of the properties in this leaflet will introduce you, at first hand, to many aspects of English history and reveal the extent of all that remains to be discovered.
Altogether, English Heritage cares for over 350 ancient monuments and buildings from the smallest standing stones to the largest fortresses.
All are historically important.
Each one is a starting point for visiting England's history.
THE HEART OF LONDON
London is one of the most exciting and fascinating cities in the world.
With its famous shops, delightful parks and rich history, there is plenty to see and do.
In the heart of London, at Westminster, are the Houses of Parliament and Westminster Abbey, both essential stops for the visitor to the capital.
Adjacent to the Abbey itself are two of the oldest remaining parts,The Chapter House and the Jewel Tower .
The magnificent medieval sculpture, some of the finest in England, and marvellous high ceiling still give The Chapter House a spiritual quality.
Built by the royal masons in 1250, it is octagonal and still has its original floor of glazed tiles.
The Jewel Tower is an intriguing remnant of the medieval Palace of Westminster, across the road from the present Houses of Parliament.
Built to house the personal treasure of Edward III, it continued in this role until the death of Henry VIII.
INFORMATION
Personal stereo guided tours available for hire.
HOW TO GET THERE
The Chapter House is on the east side of the Abbey cloister.
Approach through the Abbey or through Dean's Yard and the cloister.
The Jewel Tower is opposite the south end of the Houses of Parliament (Victoria Tower).
Buses: Frequent from surrounding areas 
LONDON'S HISTORIC HOUSES
Few of London's historic houses can still be seen as they were intended.
Alterations to many have obscured their original splendour.
Happily, four which survive almost unaltered and have been extensively restored, can be enjoyed while exploring London's suburbs.
THE IVEAGH BEQUEST, KENWOOD
On the edge of Hampstead Heath, in the heart of one of London's most desirable areas, you will find this extensive neoclassical house, remodelled by Robert Adam in 1764.
The library is one of the finest Adam rooms in existence.
With such magnificent surroundings, it is fitting that Kenwood is the home of one of the most important private collections of paintings to be given to the nation this century, including world-famous works by Rembrandt, Vermeer, Turner, Reynolds and Gainsborough.
The splendid grounds form a perfect backdrop to the lakeside concerts held here on summer evenings.
INFORMATION
Personal stereo guided tours available for hire.
Access for disabled (exterior and ground floor only).
HOW TO GET THERE
On the north side of Hampstead Heath, in Hampstead, London NW3.
CHISWICK HOUSE AND GARDENS
This internationally renowned house, in the fashionable Thameside district of Chiswick , was the epitome of ‘high society’.
Built for Lord Burlington around 1725 to house his library and art collection, it was a suitably lavish setting for entertaining his guests.
The interior decoration is quite magnificent and there are also beautiful Italian-style gardens with classical statues and neoclassical temples.
INFORMATION
Admission price includes a free personal stereo guided tour.
Access for disabled (exterior and ground floor only).
An evocation of life 250 years ago.
RANGER'S HOUSE, BLACKHEATH
A short walk from the National Maritime Museum across the gentle greenery of Greenwich Park brings you to a handsome 18th-century red brick villa, once the official residence of the Ranger of Greenwich Park, and where the statesman Lord Chesterfield would retreat from the city.
Today,Ranger's House contains the Suffolk Collection of paintings, with several Old Masters, a magnificent series of Jacobean portraits and the Dolmetsch collection of musical instruments.
MARBLE HILL HOUSE, TWICKENHAM
In open parkland setting, beside the Thames at Twickenham,Marble Hill is a magnificent villa built, between 1724–29, for Henrietta Howard, mistress of George II and later Countess of Suffolk.
The Great Room is breathtaking with lavish gilded decoration and architectural paintings by Panini.
On summer weekends, the lawns at Marble Hill provide a delightful setting for a series of riverside concerts.
DOVER CASTLE, THE KEY OF ENGLAND
One of Western Europe's most impressive medieval fortresses,Dover Castle is strategically positioned high above the White Cliffs of Dover.
It is known as ‘The Key of England’, having guarded this vulnerable coast against invasion over many centuries.
There are many reminders of its glorious past, including the Great Keep, a rare Roman lighthouse, a Saxon church and a network of ancient earthworks.
The most recent historical role played by Dover Castle was at Hellfire Corner, a labyrinth of secret tunnels concealed deep within the White Cliffs, where the evacuation of Dunkirk and the defence of the south coast in World War II were masterminded.
Access for disabled (courtyard and grounds, some steep slopes Hellfire Corner : Admission by guided tour.
The following prices are in addition to the admission to Dover Castle:
HOW TO GET THERE
Dover Castle is to the east of Dover, overlooking the town.
Hellfire Corner is within the White Cliffs at the castle.
BATTLE ABBEY AND BATTLEFIELD
If you want to see where probably the most significant event in English history occurred, visit the picturesque East Sussex town of Battle.
This is the site of the conquest of England in 1066 by William the Conqueror at the Battle of Hastings.
It was a conflict of devious tactics, heroic actions and final victory for William, who became King of England.
If you stand where King Harold's men awaited William's troops or walk through the actual battlefield you can almost sense the battle all around you.
Battle Abbey was founded by William to commemorate his victory and as a memorial to the fallen.
The substantial remains include the massive 14th century gatehouse which now houses an exhibition on the history of this important site.
THE ROAD TO CANTERBURY
The Roman road of Watling Street crosses the River Medway near Rochester Castle , and continues to Canterbury.
With its sombre strength and key strategic position it is easy to appreciate why it was an important royal stronghold for several hundred years.
You can trace the history of Christianity in England from Canterbury Cathedral to its predecessor,St Augustine's Abbey , only a short distance from the elegant confines of the cathedral.
Nearly 1,400 years ago, this was the first Christian site to be established in England after the Saxons had attempted to eradicate Christianity.
The remains include parts of an Anglo-Saxon church, a Norman church and a medieval monastery.

Some properties may close at lunch time, usually 1pm–2pm.
Most English Heritage sites are closed on 24–26 December and 1 January.
STONEHENGE, WILTSHIRE
There is nothing quite like this famous prehistoric monument anywhere else in the world.
The awe-inspiring site of Stonehenge appearing on the horizon, as one crosses Salisbury Plain, never fails to cast a spell over the traveller.
Started 5,000 years ago, some of its stones weigh over 50 tons each and many smaller ones were brought from over 100 miles away.
With massive stone lintels curved to follow the circumference of a circle, the neolithic builders were accurate in their work.
The major axis of Stonehenge is aligned with the exact positions of the midwinter and midsummer solstice, leading to suggestions that it was built for ceremonies to mark the annual calendar and seasons.
There are many theories but the mystery surrounding Stonehenge is as perpetual as the stones themselves.
AUDLEY END HOUSE, ESSEX
The ancient university town of Cambridge should be on every visitor's itinerary.
It is one of the most beautiful towns in England, with a unique atmosphere created by the happy combination of famous college buildings, like Kings College Chapel, and the delightful riverside gardens.
A few miles south of Cambridge, and just as accessible from London, is Audley End House which is well worth a detour.
The rich beauty of Audley End is a pleasure to behold.
This palatial Jacobean country mansion has lavishly decorated interiors and exquisite wooden carvings.
The Little Drawing Room, designed by Robert Adam, has gilded mouldings and intricate wall paintings.
With a total of thirty rooms, each arranged as if it was still in use, there is so much to see and enjoy.
A delightful pastoral landscape surrounds the house, displaying the inimitable talents of the great 18th-century landscaper Capability Brown.
Exhibition of farming implements in the stables.
Personal stereo guided tours available for hire.
Access for disabled (substantial ground floor area and gardens only).
CASTLES OF SUFFOLK
Whether you go to East Anglia to enjoy its individual rural charm, or perhaps to the annual Aldeburgh Festival, you will enjoy a visit to the charming Suffolk towns of Framlingham and Orford, both of which feature a splendid medieval castle.
If you have a mental picture of how a castle should look, then Framlingham Castle will turn your imagination into reality.
This superb 12th century castle has thirteen towers, linked by a continuous curtain wall.
From the top, there are excellent views over the town and countryside.
The magnificent 90 foot high tower of Orford Castle offers extensive views of Orford, and the seashore nearby.
Built by Henry II as part of his coastal defences, the tower was the final strongpoint of a considerable military complex and is remarkably well preserved.
KENILWORTH CASTLE, WARWICKSHIRE
For many people the true essence of the English landscape can be found in Shakespeare country in the County of Warwickshire.
In this land of rich, green fields, isolated villages and parks you will find Shakespeare's birthplace, at Stratford-upon-Avon, and a wealth of historic landmarks.
Chief amongst these is Kenilworth Castle , probably the most important castle in the Midlands, whose remains are certainly the most dramatic today.
The massive red sandstone walls of this great fortress are up to 20 feet thick, and you can still sense the defensive strength of the 12th century keep.
The grandest moment in Kenilworth's colourful history came when Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, who was Elizabeth I's favourite, built and furnished state rooms for her visits.
Their remains convey the Elizabethan elegance of Leicester's building and you can also enjoy the formalized symmetry of the reconstructed Tudor garden.
YORK: THE CITY AND THE SHIRE
Two thousand years of history await the visitor to the beautiful walled city of York.
Panoramic views of the city, the Minster and the nearby Castle Museum can be obtained from the top of Clifford's Tower , the 13th century keep of York Castle, erected by the Normans.
Its unique design was never put to the test in defending against attack; instead it was used as a prison almost from the time it was built.
The countryside of Yorkshire is a wonderful landscape of dales and moors, with many historic monuments.
One of the most important is the abbey at Rievaulx , a spectacular monastic ruin set in a deeply wooded valley by the River Rye.
The setting is famous for its beauty, and the magnificent remains still convey the purity of the ideals of the 12th century Cistercian monks who founded the abbey.
Three-tiered walls and arcades of massive pointed arches soar upwards in a quite breathtaking fashion.
Visitors Centre with exhibition and gift shop.
HADRIAN'S WALL
The northern frontier of Roman Britain was an outstanding piece of Roman military engineering.
Hadrian's Wall stretched over 70 miles from the Solway Firth in the west to Wallsend in the east.
It was built over 1,800 years ago but, incredibly, some sections still stand almost to their original height, and there is still plenty to see along its whole length.
Hadrian's Wall truly deserves its status as a World Heritage Site.
CHESTERS ROMAN FORT & MUSEUM
One of the best preserved parts is Chesters Roman Fort , set among the ancient wooded valleys of Northumberland, overlooking the River North Tyne.
The substantial remains of this cavalry fort include the bath house, where you can still see how the underfloor heating system worked.
The museum houses a collection of Roman sculpture and inscriptions, gathered from many different sites along the wall.

MOTHER SHIPTON'S CAVE & THE PETRIFYING WELL
Visit England's Oldest Attraction
THE STORY OF MOTHER SHIPTON AND THE HISTORIC PARK
Mother Shipton is England's most famous Prophetess.
She lived some 500 years ago in the times of King Henry VIIIth and Queen Elizabeth 1st.
She was born in a cave beside Knaresborough's mysterious Petrifying Well, delivered as lightening crackled and burned in a violent storm.
As she grew older, her prophetic visions became known and feared throughout England.
She foretold the invasion and defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588; and Samuel Pepys' Diary grimly records that Mother Shipton gave forewarning of the Great Fire of London in 1666.
Beside the Cave, the famous Petrifying Well is a unique geological phenomenon.
Curiosity has drawn millions of visitors over hundreds of years, to see cascading water turn everyday objects to stone — as if by magic!
The Cave and the Well lie at the heart of the Mother Shipton Estate — a relic of the Ancient Forest of Knaresborough.
The beautiful riverside walks and carriage drive were classically landscaped with beech trees in the 18th century.
‘Sir Henry Slingsby's Long Walk’ leads visitors to the Cave and Well.
English Heritage lists the Estate in its register of ‘Historic Parks & Gardens’
Carriages without horses shall go,
And accidents fill the world with woe,
Around the world thoughts shall fly
In the twinkling of an eye.
Iron in the water shall float
As easy as a wooden boat.
Gold shall be found, and found
In a land that's not now known.

DOCK AND SHOP
When Michael Marks first wheeled his Penny Bazaar barrow into Leeds Market in 1884, he can have had little idea that his actions were to one day progress Marks and Spencer to become the nation's leading retailer.
Marks' entrepreneurial spirit was typical of a city that has thrived on its ability to sell.
From the famous cloth markets, which first identified the city as a bargain-hunters' paradise, to the splendour of the Victorian shopping arcades, Leeds has always had the leading edge in retail.
Today's shoppers will discover sensitively-restored shopping quarters shouldering friendly markets, and pavement cafes nestling alongside high-street names.
LEEDS MARKETS
Traditional Northern markets, boasting typical Yorkshire value.
Some real bargains lie in wait amongst the never-ending maze of stalls.
The Market Hall in Kirkgate, being restored to its Edwardian splendour, promises some colourful browsing.
CORN EXCHANGE SHOPPING
A real opportunity for speciality shopping; over 50 retail outlets are housed within the magnificent architecture — a relaxed pavement cafe atmosphere, with ever-changing entertainment.
Meet the Corn Traders, who still gather in this Victorian showpiece.
Open all week.
VICTORIA QUARTER
A most striking combination of stylish, individual shops and glorious architecture, covered over with the largest stained glass roof in Europe.
Breath-taking Victoria arcades have been completely renovated and now contain quality food to fashion — all with designer flair.
A new flow of leisure and tourism attractions has transformed Leeds into one of the most dynamic and exciting areas of waterside development in Britain.
The Royal Armouries Museum arrives at Clarence Dock in 1996, bringing its breath-taking collection of treasures to a waterfront location.
A wealth of inviting attractions await all visitors who take the plunge…
Leeds lies glittering between the valleys of Yorkshire's dales and the heather of Yorkshire moors.
The city's central positioning — midway between Edinburgh and London — placed Leeds in the heart of the country, and at the crossroads of the North/South M1 route and the East/West M621.
Hourly electric trains connect London to the U.K.'s Northern Capital in under two hours, whilst the regional attractions of York and Harrogate rest even closer to hand.
Road, rail, canal and river all flow into the city, making Leeds Waterfront an ideal place to dock.
THE TOURIST INFORMATION CENTRE is glad to help you with any enquiry.
Open office hours and Saturdays until 4.00pm.
LEEDS CITY TOURISM can arrange tours for groups, via our private tour service.
LEEDS WATERFRONT is a Tourism Development Action Programme, building bridges across Leeds for Tourism and Leisure.
It is a partnership between the English Tourist Board, Yorkshire and Humberside Tourist Board, Leeds City Council, Leeds Development Corporation and British Waterways.
JOHN BULLS WORLD OF ROCK
fun for all the family!
Welcome to John Bull's world of Rock
PROCESSES IN THE MANUFACTURE OF ROCK AND TOFFEE
John Bull manufacture rock and confectionery and distribute throughout Britain supplying a host of seaside and tourist venues.
The business of manufacturing rock was started in Bridlington in 1911 by the present Managing Directors grandfather.
The Rock was made in the back of the shop and sold to holidaymakers who returned home with lettered Rock for family and friends.
This was the beginning of the British tradition — Seaside Rock.
Since those early days, John Bull have expanded, opening many shops around the country, leading to the opening of the new factory in 1984.
The policy of John Bull is to make the finest confectionery in the old fashioned way, using the best ingredients.
When you visit the factory, you will see the different stages of manufacturing, from the mixing of ingredients to the extrusion of the mixture and the lettering in the rock, the preparation of the famous John Bull Fudge and  Toffees — made with real cream and butter the old fashioned way to recipes over a 100 years old.

IMAX…the giant cinema screen!
ANTARCTICA
NATIONAL MUSEUM OF PHOTOGRAPHY FILM AND TELEVISION BRADFORD
IMAX — SO REAL, YOU'LL THINK YOU'RE THERE!
Everything about the IMAX system is big.
The UK's largest cinema screen, a giant five storeys high, it also uses the world's biggest existing film format, and prints the pictures sideways.
The resulting images are ten times larger than the conventional 35mm kind.
The film runs horizontally through an enormous projector (which, in the Museum, can be seen at work from an observation gallery) and throws vast, brilliant images onto a screen 52 feet high and 64 feet wide.
You just can't help becoming involved in the action!
And what action!!
ANTARCTICA
Follow the footsteps of the Great Explorers to the frozen frontiers of the world — to ANTARCTICA!
For the first time ever, in a giant film format, you can journey to the Earth's last great wilderness.
Soar above glacial peaks and swim underwater through the icy caverns submerged within the Chaos Glacier.
And gambol with the natives: penguins and southern seals, charming and unafraid of mankind in this frozen and beautiful world.
ANTARCTICA meets, too, the continent's other inhabitants: the international scientists battling against the climate to explore its delicate and amazing ecology.
Don't miss this chance to journey to the ‘last place on earth’.
BLUE PLANET
BLUE PLANET takes you 350 miles into space to view the breathtaking sight of our world, surrounded by the narrow, fragile band of atmosphere that supports life on earth.
BLUE PLANET's sensational photography explores continents and oceans, and looks too at the forces that influence our environment: storms, volcanoes, earthquakes, typhoons and, perhaps the most powerful of all, Mankind.
For the truth is that no single agent affects our planet as much as we do.
The theme throughout BLUE PLANET is the urgent need to protect our world from ourselves.
It is a message we have all heard before.
The powerful pictures in this new IMAX have a force that no other medium can convey.
TO FLY /WE ARE BORN OF STARS
This season, we welcome the return of TO FLY, a soaring, white-knuckle aerial exploration of America, from balloon ascension to journey into space.
Skim over the coast of Hawaii in a glider, roar across Arizona with the US Navy's Blue Angels and lift off to space in a Saturn V rocket.
Not for the faint hearted…
WE ARE BORN OF STARS is the 3-D IMAX film which takes you into a new dimension using state-of-the-art computer graphics.
Sit back as you go on a five billion year journey through the evolution of life — all in twelve minutes!
REMEMBER — IN BRITAIN, IMAX CAN BE SEEN ONLY AT THE NATIONAL MUSEUM OF PHOTOGRAPHY, FILM AND TELEVISION, BRADFORD

BLUE PLANET
For centuries, humans stared upwards into space, seeking to uncover mysteries beyond the Earth, before they had even explored the limits of its surface.
Yet, only in the last half of the 20th century has a select band of some 200 people been able to call themselves astronauts —‘travellers in interplanetary space’.
Only they have had the chance to view the Earth from this unique vantage point — until now.
Now the astronauts themselves have bridged the gap between their vision and our earthbound experience.
BLUE PLANET mainly comprises scenes shot by orbiting shuttle crew members using the unique IMAX system.
The massive pin-sharp image completely fills the five-storey screen and you are there, as surely as if you were in an orbiting Shuttle.
‘When you are out in space and you look down, you get the feeling that this is a precious place out here in the universe’ said Shuttle pilot Colonel John Blaha.
Astronauts have learned that we live on a delicate planet whose complex workings are poorly understood.
They are determined to help others realise this and take steps to protect it.
That is the powerful message of BLUE PLANET.
How can we help?
An educational pack explaining the background to many of the issues raised in BLUE PLANET has been prepared by educationalists, environmentalists and others in association with Du Pont and its subsidiary Conoco.
‘Understanding the Environment’ is available to schools and individuals throughout Europe, using video, information sheets, and follow up projects, to explain current scientific understanding of the processes affecting all life on our planet.
The pack can be bought through the National Museum of Photography, Film and Television to complement the showing of BLUE PLANET.
Du Pont and Conoco have also supported the production of a Museum multi-vision presentation LAND — WATER — AIR which will be screened alongside the film on a new projection system supplied by Hasselblad (UK) Ltd.
Du Pont is a global innovator in science and technology; Conoco is a pioneer in offshore oil and gas development.
Both Du Pont and Conoco are world leaders, in their respective sectors, in environmental protection and safety.
JORVIK VIKING CENTRE
DISCOVER FOR YOURSELF THE VIKING CITY OF JORVIK
Jorvik is the Viking city uncovered by archaeologists beneath Coppergate, York.
As they peeled back the debris of centuries, complete houses and workshops emerged, still containing everyday tools, utensils and clothing from a civilisation buried for a thousand years.
Now you can visit the Jorvik Viking Centre, step aboard a time car and be whisked back through the centuries on a journey to real-life Viking Britain.
A bustling market, dark, smokey houses and a busy wharf have all been re-created in accurate detail so that you can experience in sight, sound and smell exactly what it was like to live and work in the Viking city of Jorvik.
Then, round a corner, you find yourself in the famous archaeological dig, which has been reconstructed where it took place, with the preserved tenth century buildings re-erected where they were found.
From there you pass to the Skipper Gallery to see the many magnificent and delicate objects found on the dig.
On your time trip there is a commentary, available in four languages, explaining everything that you see and hear.
All of which makes the Jorvik Viking Centre not just the journey of a lifetime, but the most exciting journey in a thousand years.
The Jorvik Viking Centre is open 7 days a week.
Last admission half an hour before closing time.
Evening viewing for parties of at least 50 can be arranged for either 1900 or 1930.
There is good access for disabled visitors.

Designed by John Carr of York and built over a period of thirteen years between 1759 and 1772, its spectacular interior boasts exquisite plasterwork ceilings by the Scottish architect Robert Adam decorated by Angelica Kaufman, Biagio Rebecca and Antonio Zucchi.
It contains unrivalled 18th century English furniture made especially for Harewood by Thomas Chippendale, born only a few miles further up the Wharfe Valley at Otley.
The house is surrounded by 1000 acres of spectacular parkland, gardens and woodland shaped by Lancelot ‘Capability’ Brown, the most renowned designer of English landscape.
A COMPREHENSIVE illustrated guidebook to the house and gardens is available, and an audio-guide can be hired in which Lord Harewood presents a personalised tour through each room, describing highlights of the remarkable collection of pictures, furniture, fine Chinese porcelain and outstanding Sèvres and Crown Derby china.

Many of the Italian pictures were collected by Henry, the sixth Earl of Harewood and husband of HRH Princess Mary the Princess Royal who lived here from 1929 until her death in 1965.
THE GALLERY, one of Adam's most magnificent decorative schemes, extends over the whole west end of the house and provides an elegant ambience, with excellent acoustics, for chamber music.

THE TEXTILE ART OF THE BANJARA GYPSIES
A LARGE IMPRESSIVE COLLECTION OF RICHLY WORKED ABSTRACT EMBROIDERY FROM ONE OF THE MOST CREATIVELY ORIGINAL TEXTILE CULTURES OF THE WORLD
GORDON REECE GALLERY PRESENTS PREVIEW 9th MAY 10.30–5.00
THE TEXTILE ART OF THE BANJARA GYPSIES
We have gathered together the largest and most spectacular collection of Indian BANJARA embroidery ever to be shown in the UK.
This rich group of textiles were made by the Banjara gypsies of India, whose predecessors are thought to have been the world's original gypsy stock.
They gained acceptance and wealth as carriers to the Mugal kings, travelling vast distances to supply far flung armies with grain in exchange for gold, silver and salt.
These fiercely proud and self sufficient peoples were mostly Hindu, but rejected Temple worship in favour of a spiritual celebration of the elements: air, earth, water, fire and metal — these being denoted by five symbols or motifs in their intricate embroideries.
These magical textiles were crafted from the imagination and yet served a very practical purpose in daily life, so we find grain bags, bread bags, dowry bags, rumals or covers, pouches in a variety of vibrant colours and shapes, and headpieces for carrying water.
These expressive designs are worked in rich vegetable dyed threads (indigo being reserved for the chief's family) and often embellished with mirrors, tassles and cowrie shells.
This collection has been brought together at a time when the Banjara people are gravitating towards the cities relinquishing their nomadic life and abandoning their dynamic textile art.
ETHNIC AND TRIBAL JEWELLERY
To complement this wonderful collection of textiles the Gordon Reece Gallery has amassed over a thousand old and rare examples of jewellery from many of the great Tribal craft traditions of the world.
The colour and exuberance of this collection of traditional ‘ethnic’ jewellery provides some startling contrasts from the dramatic almost sculptural pieces of the Nagas to the exquisite intricacy of Indian silverwork.
Complicated interwoven crosses from Ethiopia vie with the elaborate dowry jewellery of the Turkomans of Afghanistan while the simple bold brasswork of West Africa stands coolly against the dense beadwork of Burma.
The diversity of designs, is only matched by the variety of materials and techniques used by unknown  artisan makers to such spectacular effect.
In a rapidly shrinking world where Third World countries are striving to  acquire the trappings of Western materialism, much of what caused these diverse cultures to be unique and exciting is being cast aside.
One of the first things to go are the costumes and articles of adornment which identify that culture with its roots.
The disappearance of original traditional jewellery is one of the first signs of this unfortunate trend.
What was once a visual statement of security in the form of dowry jewellery or even rank, marvellous skilled and beautiful objects, are being melted down and sold for scrap every day!!

DUNCOMBE PARK
Home of Lord and Lady Feversham
‘The place in this country by far most worth the attention of the curious traveller, it cannot be viewed without the most exquisite enjoyment’(Arthur Young 1770)
Duncombe Park was designed in 1713 by William Wakefield for Thomas Duncombe, whose descendants still own the property today.
The pavilions and forecourt were added by Sir Charles Barry in 1843.
The house was seriously damaged by fire in 1879 but rebuilt largely to the original design.
Its principal rooms are a fine example of the type of ‘grand interior’ popular in the late 19th century.
In 1916 the 2nd Earl of Feversham was killed at the Battle of the Somme and the house became a girls' school until 1895.
It has now been restored to a superb family home by the present Lord and Lady Feversham and it is hard to imagine that only a few years ago the house was little more than an empty, echoing shell.
The principal rooms contain Lord Feversham's collection of English and Continental furniture and fine family pictures, many from the original Duncombe Park collection.
The early 18th century 30-acre garden, set in 300 acres of dramatic parkland around the River Rye, has been described as ‘the supreme masterpiece of the art of the landscape gardener’.
With its classical temples, great lawns, magnificent tree-lined terraces, woodland walks and hidden vistas, it should be explored at leisure.
For those who wish to venture further afield there are two waymarked Country Walks.
In the Visitor Centre, close to the car park, is a high quality gift shop, exhibition and audio visual on Duncombe Park in the 20th century.
Here too is the only historic house tearoom in North Yorkshire to feature on ‘The Teapot Trail ’.

THE AMAZING WORLD OF HOLOGRAMS
Unique and Fascinating Experience over 200 Holograms
HOLOGRAPHY AT  ITS BEST!
A unique opportunity to see the largest collection of holograms presently on display in the U.K. with its continually growing and changing collection of well over 200 holograms.
This is a visual experience guaranteed to fascinate and delight both young and old alike.
Holograms are 3 dimensional images of scenes and events, enabling the viewer to look around from side to side, up and down to see different areas of the subject.
An interesting property is the ability of the hologram to project well out in front of itself into free space.
This leads to the  irresistible urge to reach out and grasp hold only to find your hand passing through these images of solid light.
New techniques and developments have taken place to give multi-exposure and animated holograms of subjects that change and move as the viewer looks around them.
Some unexpected surprises are in store for you whilst walking around the gallery.
Other holograms on display cover a wide range of subjects from human portraits, to priceless relics of the past including a hologram of the famous ‘Pete Marsh’ the body in the bog; York's famous ‘Coppergate Helmet’and many of the holograms featured on the BBC's ‘Tomorrow's World’.
A recent addition is a collection of plasma balls, spheres of living  lightning that contain an antenna which generates fluorescent ions.
These react with rare gases to create blazing, coloured cascades of plasma particles.
Touch the sphere and the tentacles of light reach out towards you, gathering harmlessly around your hand.
Two laser displays which create geometric patterns of pure light pulsate to the atmospheric music.
You can even control and create your own exciting laser show.
Also in the gallery is the holographic giftshop which offers a rare opportunity to purchase fascinating souvenirs from a dazzling range of laser products, the latest hologram watches and calculators and a unique range of holographic jewellery, with the largest selection of holograms for the home.
ENTERTAINMENT FOR ALL THE FAMILY.
SEE THE FUTURE — NOW!
MAKING A SIMPLE REFLECTION HOLOGRAM
A beam of light emits from the laser (A)— through shutter (B) to beam splitter (C) where it divides into object and reference beam.
Object beam: About 90% of the light passes through the beam splitter (C) and is reflected by mirror (D) to the beam expanding lens (E) and then onto the object (G) by mirror (F).
Reference beam: About 10% of the light is reflected of the beam splitter (C) through beam expanding lens (H) and reflected off mirror (I) onto the holographic plate (J).
Light reflecting from the object interferes with the reference beam.
The resulting interference pattern is recorded in the emulsion on the holographic plate.
After processing, the light from just the reference beam, directed at the plate, will ‘replay’ the hologram as if the object were still in place.

You will experience the sights, the sounds, even the smells of those dangerous years.
This is no ordinary Museum — Not another Military Museum — Not a glass show case — it is a series of reconstructed scenes using movement, sound, lighting, smells, even smoke generators to make you feel you are actually there taking part.
Our special living Museum is constructed appropriately in the huts of a genuine Prisoner of War Camp build during 1942.
This fascinating display holds, and reveals to you the vital spirit which eventually triumphed in 1945.
These superb exhibits created by experts make a visit to EDEN CAMP a wonderful and revealing day out for all the family (please allow three hours plus for a visit).
It is the only Theme Museum to offer such an experience — so don't miss it!
