I think she's  I think she I said Are you gonna vote Conservative like, just cos you've got a canny job.
I says, and your house.
and she looked at me she, what do you mean, I says, you know.
I says, you vote what you want I says, I says erm,you're sitting pretty just now.
She were like  I thought, aye I wonder how you'd get by if you didn't have a job.

Aye .
Especially if you're used to having the money and all like .
They are.
just been finished off the rigs.
Aye there's a lot gonna be finished off the rigs.
Oh well all that  got paid off because of erm giving the yankees the contract or something.
The  the contract.
He's got his name down like so he might be lucky and get a phone call cos he  
Well what happens if they don't and  Thirty pound social security.
Me Aunty Linda's not working either, like she didn't need the money  but I mean he was on the dole for years me Uncle Ron.
Mm.
He was like, he was on the dole for years man, he was lucky to get that but I mean he used to.
Aye.
So it was his last trip and he's waiting to hear something now so  
Well that's one t one thing about us,never ever made good wages.
I mean he worked hard, he worked he worked six nights a week.
He used to work twelve hour twelve, thirteen hour shift he worked.
And his wages weren't all that good and he worked  kids.
And he never got good wages .
.
Just didn't get good money.
Seems to me I was Jobs are hard, the weren't like secure jobs.
You got a few months and then you were paid off you were back on the dole .
 
I remember .
I mean many a time we had  mm.
oh fine you know,.
As I was saying to me mam like, all these John Major and that, they're all going on about what they're gonna do.
But they've all got big houses and loads of money.
They don't know what it's like er being on the dole .
I know they don't have to go and say, ee  can I afford that this week or can I 
Aye.
afford that.
It's alright for them to say we're gonna do this and 
 
do that, but they get everything easy don't they.
I mean they all say they understand what it's like being on the dole and that, but they don't.
Of course they don't.
Nobody knows.
Nobody knows.
If anybody tells you ..
No.
I mean did you see that them lads that were round that  discussion.
And this lad got up and he says, I get thirty one pound social security.
He says I have to pay me rent, he says me rent's three pound right, he says I have to pay me poll tax, I have to pay me electric, me gas.
He says, feed meself all out of that thirty two poun He says, could yous manage on that?
And he had a place of his own, a flat, he was on his own.
How how would how would what would you have out of thirty two pound.
I'd love to see them manage on it for a year  
I mean you couldn't.
They couldn't could they.
And then that one conservative who did go and do it, he swapped places with people who were on the dole, and he went and lived  up in Newcastle.
Never heard of him after that did you I mean?
Well they swapped places didn't they.
Aye you never heard of him after that.
So who do you think'll get in?
Well I think it's hard to say.
Well I think Labour'll get in like.
Do you?
Well I .
Cos somebody was saying something about the la the last time they got in, it all went
It's er very very poor .
You see there's been that there's been that many flung out of jobs Sharon, there's been that many people put out of jobs, there's been that many people bought their houses and been put out on the streets they've got no homes  you know .
It's about time like s somebody else had a go at it because  
Aye.
Aha.
Labour or Conservative 
That's why me mum and dad voted Liberal Democrat this time, I mean they never vote for them .
There'll be a lot like that.
There'll be a lot.
And me mam says, oh just for a change to give someone else a chance.
you swing the whole it could just swing.
Paddy Ashdown.
I like him, I was watching him on the telly the other day, I think he seemed nice.
There's not many people like Neil Kinnock like.
Well I think John Major's nice.
Did you see Spitting Image  ?
Aye  Ee  
Ee it was great.
Why was he grey?
Me and me mam couldn't understand it  
Yes You c he's grey because it's all to do  you turn grey.
That's what he was grey for.
Oh.
Because he's grey because he knows he's losing, he's gonna lose his job.
Well they have published that he's gonna lose 
Aye.
his job, they mightn't.
Ah.
.
Might come up trumps.  on the night but nobody  do on.
It's the politics didn't work  gotta mention politics, it's just to get away from politics.
Who was this?
put a do on tonight.
We were laughing at the Sun this morning, had a picture of Neil Kinnock's head in the light bulb and it said, could the last person out of Britain please turn the light off after them.
You see and another thing what they're saying is thirty year ago when Labour was in, there were strikes and everything  
Aye   was saying that.
I mean grave grave diggers went on strike, hospitals went on strike, couldn't bury your dead.
Stuff wasted in the streets, rubbish and all that and there was rats and everything.
Er you know but you see, conservative won the election  and because what they did was, if you went on strike they they paid you off, you got sacked and you just didn't get any money .
And so people had no other option but to go out to work.
Even if you had any grievance against your employee, it didn't stand.
Mm.
And and employers put an end to people.
They took an end because they took them in a scheme where the kids actually  got jobs  what you've done.
Now then that  after about six weeks or eight weeks, if you've got a kid  you can have them .
Oh aye I don't believe in the Y T Ss and that like .
job.
No.
So that's doing away with a person's er wage isn't it.
I think there's a few times I was gonna pack in cos I used to do the same amount of work as everyone else and I got paid 
That's right and you were only getting aha 
not even half what they were getting  
And the government pays them that.
So they really were getting you for nothing.
Oh aye.
So they've made cheap labour.
They've made er  and you know what they did, they've privatized all the jobs.
They school cleaners and hospital cleaners 
Then they brought this poll tax didn't they?
Aha.
The poll tax has done them through.
I was gonna say, if they lose it's I think a lot of it'll be through the poll tax.
Aha.
Poll tax and people getting flung out of houses.
 
That's not him is it?
I think she's got a new husband now.
Not him.
That's that little fella.
Aye I think he's her new husband.

Oh  
For the first time in about three weeks.
Sa s He's been to the psychiatrist you know..
Oh that's 
They're going.
Two of them, sitting talking to him.
They go and off it with the doctor.
.
He's o What was he on he was drinking, what a bottle and a half of vodka and about fifteen pints of cider a day.
.
He went to the doctor's he says, listen if you drink another drink you'll be dead in six month.
Mhm.
Full stop, there's forty milligrams of  valium.
Mhm.
You've gotta take that a day.
They reckon the doctor should've says to him He shouldn't have said that, full stop, you should never say that to an alcoholic.
They reckon he should've said cut it down to about two or three, four pints a day, there's fifteen milligrams of valium.
Fifteen so you're talking treble.
He was taking treble the amount of valium  and drinking and all .
What did he do John?
Oh he was great tonight he was back to his normal self tonight.
Aye I saw him down the pub .
He's had about three pints but that's what they've told him to take.
The psychiatrist has told him to take three pints of lager.
.
Jeff went to the psychiatrist and they start babbling on saying about the forty milligrams of valium he's taking.
They says the doctor's given you that to take you off the alcohol.
They says, right, he says, I've got a I've got a problem with alcohol and he's given us the valium to get us off the alcohol.
He says, right six months time I'm totally off the alcohol, he says, what's gonna get us off the valium?
Cos that that does you up 
Ah.
that stuff.
How many people get addicted to that?
Oh aye.
He says, right I'm gonna go off the alcohol, I'll be totally teetotal but I'll be taking valium, he says it's just like a vicious circle, what am I gonna do after the valium.
What you gonna give us to take us off that?
And they told him they told him he shouldn't even be on that.
So what have they given him?
The doctor didn't even say six month.
He sh he did but he didn't.
His mam's been on the phone .
Where to?
The doctor.
The doctor's?
Aye the doctor.
And the doctor hadn't said six months?
He did.
He did he said that which he shouldn't have done.
He says if you have another drink if you keep on drinking, you'll be dead in six month.
Oh.
And is he saying he didn't say that ?
That was to scare him.
He says if he doesn't stop drinking he'll be dead in five year.
So I said that so he would stop thinking.
Aha.
But you don't do that.
No with a proper alcoholic.
He's sound as a pound isn't he like, he's only had a couple of pints.
first time you've been able to talk to him properly.
So is he still on valium?
Aye but he's on next to nowt compared to what he was.
What's he drinking, lager?
Owt.
Doesn't make any difference just so long as it's equivalent to two pints of lager.
has he admitted he's an alcoholic  John?
Aye.
Is he.
I think it's between two and four pints of lager he's allowed to have a night as long as he doesn't touch spirits.
Aye.
But me and Jimmy was standing  say like me and Jimmy have what seven or eight pints, a night.
.
When I go out, aye, seven or eight pints.
Oh.
Jeff can only have three or four.
So we says to him, why didn't he get a half of lager a h a bottle of Kaliber which is a half of lager non-alcohol, and put it in a pint glass.
Aha.
So he can have like four pints but it'll be exactly the same as us having eight.
