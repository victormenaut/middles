INTRODUCTION
Hello and welcome to this book of performance poems.
The main thing about the poems in this book is that you've got to say them aloud.
It's no good whispering them to yourself on the top deck of an otherwise empty bus, you've got to shout them in school halls, fields, front rooms of houses, from your bedroom window…anywhere, really.
We've given you a few hints how to say them, dance to them, put great big eight foot wide  papier mâché masks on to do them if you want.
Enjoy them, that's the main thing!

NOW THEN DAVOS
Davos the hippy wears big flares — so big they're like vast flapping sails.
On windy days he finds himself flying over Doncaster, flares a-flap, hair streaming behind him like a curtain.
Mrs Davos, sick of flying, decides they should buy a car from Fat Frank.
So, Davos and Mrs Davos try to buy the car they like and Fat Frank tries to sell the one he likes.
What a drama!
NOWTHEN DAVOS
Well I went to buy a car
Yes I went to buy a car
I went to buy a car in Doncaster
He got a chip stain on his breath
And a beer stain on his coat
He took me by the hand
And he shook me by the throat
He said
Nowthen Davos
Nowthen Davos
Nowthen Davos
Does tha live in a commune?
Nowthen Davos

Nowthen Davos
Does tha live in a commune?
Oh what a greasy man
Oh what a greasy man
I saw him coming over
I nearly ran
He said Is that the wife then?
Rubbed his slimy gut
Grabbed her by the chin
Said Nowthen Gingernut!

Well you don't want a Fiat
You don't want a yellow car
You don't want front wheel drive
Haven't stood the test of time.
What you want's an Escort
Maybe red or black
And it just so happens pal
I've got one round the back
Nowthen Davos
Nowthen Davos

Does tha live in a commune?
Nowthen Davos
Nowthen Davos
Nowthen Davos
Does tha live in a commune?
Well we didn't buy a car
No we didn't buy a car
We didn't buy a car
From him in Doncaster
We ran to the bus stop
Glad to be alive
And we got a yellow Fiat
With front wheel drive.

An old junior school.
A mad headteacher in a huge blue suit and big leather boots.
He stalks the corridors creaking like a giant bat.
Just waiting to pounce on some terrified child.
Is it Dracula?…
No, it's —
MR MOORE
Mr Moore Mr Moore
Creaking down the corridor
Uh ee Uh Uh ee
Uh ee Uh Uh ee
Mr Moore wears wooden suits
Mr Moore's got iron boots
Mr Moore's got hair like a brush
And Mr Moore don't like me much
Mr Moore Mr Moore
Creaking down the corridor
Uh ee Uh Uh ee
Uh ee Uh Uh ee
When my teacher's there I haven't got a care
Can do my sums, can do  gerzinters 
When Mr Moore comes through the door
Got a wooden head filled with splinters
Mr Moore Mr Moore
Creeping down the corridor
Uh ee Uh Uh ee
Uh ee Uh Uh ee
Mr Moore I implore
My earholes ache my head is sore
Don't come through that classroom door
Mr Moore wears iron suits
Mr Moore's got wooden boots
Mr Moore's got hair like a brush
And Mr Moore don't like me much
Mr Moore Mr Moore
Creaking down the corridor
Uh ee Uh Uh ee
Uh ee Uh Uh ee
A school trip sets off.
You're on the bus — all the grown ups shout goodbye.
It's nearly time to eat your sandwiches.

We've been driving a car like this for years.
My Granny's sofa always gets to Cleethorpes first.
PICNIC POEM
In our car in our car
In our c-c car
In our car in our car
In our brand new car
We're up we're away its a beautiful day
Zooming along the motorway
Dad at the wheel, picnic in the boot
Sunshine and laughter planning the route
In our car in our car
In our brand new car
Crunch bang What's that?
Crunch bang What's that?
A whistle and a knock, a thumping shock
A whining fizz and a crack on the block
A rattle and a splutter, a groaning mutter
Cuts through the racket like a knife through butter.
 That's our car that's our car
That's our c-c-c…
Shhhhhhhhhhhhh
Crunch bang What's that?
Crunch bang What's that?
A shove and a kick, Dad's got a stick
And he's banging on the engine cos it makes him sick
A mallet and a crowbar, to try to make it go far
He'd be better off trying to drive my Granny's sofa
We've stopped, we're stuck, we're out of luck
Waiting for the man with the breakdown truck
Out with the picnic up with the bonnet
We'll be here for hours bet your life upon it
In our car in our car
In our c-c-car
In our car in our car
In our flipping useless car
Why do grown men spot trains?
Why do they think trains are so hard to spot in the first place?
Why do they all wear fur lined anoraks with the hood up at all times?
Do they think they're in a tunnel?
Why are so many train spotters called Derek?
Here is the story of one of them, Derek, the most unsuccessful train spotter in the world.
TRAINSPOTTER
Trainspotter trainspotter trainspotter train train
Trainspotter trainspotter trainspotter train train
He's got the anorak he's got the duffle bag
The big notebook and a pocket full of pens
Fountain pens and cartridge pens

Coz Derek's ready Derek's ready Derek's ready
For the red light orange light green light
GO!
Missed it.
Trainspotter trainspotter trainspotter train train

He's got the sandwiches he's got the Thermos flask
Family pack of crisps and a pocket full of sweets
Chocolate bars and Yorkie bars
And all those flipping Penguins

Cos Derek's ready Derek's ready Derek's ready
For the red light orange light green light
GO!

Have another go have another go
Get a closer look get a closer look
At the red light orange light green light

Right in the back right in the back
Right in the back of the anorak
So now they're spotting Derek

They've got the anorak that's in Crewe

Covers all the regions covers all the regions
Mind you so does Derek

With his red light orange light green light
GO!

The cooler than cool new street dance from Pontefract West Yorkshire.
They don't pop, they don't break they're so cool they swim up the streets of Pontefract!
YO!
THE PONTEFRACT STREET SWIM
There's a whole sensation in Pontefract
Swim up the street, just can't be beat
Give your fins a flick you're looking slick
Crawl on your front, crawl on your back
Wear skimpy shorts and skin tight caps
It's the rumble of the humble in Pontefract.
Street swim street swim Pontefract
Street swim street swim Pontefract
Go to the highrise butterfly down
You're looking cool don't need no pool
Flat on your face in the market place
Go to the racecourse freestyle round
Pump those waterwings, don't you drown
 It's the mutter from the gutter in Pontefract.
Street swim street swim Pontefract

Street swim street swim Pontefract

Well, body popping's dead in  Pontefract 
You're looking cute in your birthday suit
With your snorkel and your flippers and your  liquorice root
Doing the breast stroke you'll attract
A whole lotta action, the street is packed
And the breakdance DJ's just been sacked
It's the mutter from the gutter in Pontefract.
Street swim street swim Pontefract
Street swim street swim Pontefract
It's the sensation of the nation
In Pontefract
Every school has a caretaker.
Short ones, fat ones, thin ones, tall ones — but there aren't many around like Fred.
FRED
I'm Fred, the school caretaker
without a head
look at me.
I'm Fred, the school caretaker
without a head.
My head fell off in bed the other night,
I looked at the wife and she died of fright.
I'm Fred, the school caretaker
without a head.
When I go to the pub me mates say Flipping Heck
'Cos I carry the beer on top of me neck
I'm Fred, the school caretaker
without a head
Some vandals came to school and they seemed pretty rough
but I just had to look at them, that was enough.
I'm Fred, the school caretaker
without a head
I stood behind Mrs Thatcher, gave a little cough,
she turned round, screamed and her wig fell off,
I'm Fred, the school caretaker
without a head
I went to school with Michael.
He always nicked my toy cars.
Once he nicked my entire Corgi transporter filled with cars and a train set.
But — poor lad — he suffered.
With a name like that it was to be expected.
A real drip, always running.
We forgave him because of his problems.
MICHAEL HANKIE
Well his name was Michael Hankie
And he came from Crystal Palace
And he wasn't a very nice boy.
At Alexandra Road Junior School
He nicked my favourite toy
But I didn't mind, I soon forgave him
Kept my temper believe it or not
Coz I realised that the poor boy had a problem
His last name was covered in snot.
Well his name was Michael Hankie
And he came from Crystal Palace
And nicking things was his game.
But we didn't mind, we soon forgave him
Because of his unfortunate name.
Is it a rocket?
Is it a plane?
Is it a dancing superhero come to rescue us all.
Yes it's…
BARNSLEY MAN
Help help
there's people trapped in the burning building!
HELP HELP
there's people trapped in the burning school!
Who we gonna shout for
who we gonna yell for
who we gonna ring up?
It's 1 2 3 4 Barnsley Man!
He's faster than a speeding tortoise
He's braver than Mavis Riley
He's better looking than Dot Cotton
He's a better fighter than Postman Pat!
It's 1 2 3 4 Barnsley Man!
Here he comes running
through the rain
here he comes running
cos he's missed his train
It's 1 2 3 4 Barnsley Man!
He's into the burning building…
The walls are on fire, the  floor's on fire,
the stairs are on fire…
He climbs up the stairs and his tights are on fire!
It's 1 2 3 4 Barnsley Man!
He does the ancient Barnsley Tights on Fire dance.
It's okay kids, I'm here now
no need to panic
no need to roast
your knees won't boil
and your neck won't toast
my cape's on fire
and my shirt's in tatters
but I'm here now
and that's all that matters
Barnsley man is going to save your skin,
he's gonna wrap up the fire
and drop it in the bin
I'm the fastest fire fighter you've ever seen
as I put out the fire with…whatever you like!
Another superhero for you all to meet.
Why won't he just admit he's as bald as an egg?
CAPTAIN 3 STRANDS
Drag it over
Comb it across
Who's this guy?
He's the boss
He's Captain 3 Strands
Wakes up every morning
Looking like an egg
Pulls up the hairs
From the back of his leg
Swirl to the left
Swirl to the right
He's going to break some hearts tonight
He's Captain 3 Strands!
Goes to the bathroom
Washes his face
Checks his style
Is still in place
Hair on the left
Hair on the right
Hair down the middle — Dynamite!
He's Captain 3 Strands!
Out of the house
Running for a bus
The wicked wind blows
With a sudden gust
Strands to the left
Strands to the right
The Captain's in trouble
His face turns white
All the people turn and stare
At a worried guy with boot lace hair
Is it a bird?
Is it a plane?
Is it a 50 watt bulb that a child's been scribbling on
with a black felt tip pen?
No!
No!
No!
It's Captain 3 Strands
Drag it over
Comb it across
Who's this guy
He's the boss
He's Captain 3 Strands.

Another participation piece ideal for two people or two groups, each taking alternate verses.
The poem is, of course, about Britain's answer to Disneyworld…
BARNSLEY BY THE SEA
Acapulco
Costa Del Sol
Disney World
I've tried 'em all.
I've sailed on the sea
I've sat on the beach
I'm looking for something
Just out of reach.
Well Barnsley pal
Is the place for thee.
We talk like him and look like me.
But
Acapulco
Costa Del Sol
Disney World
I've tried 'em all.
So what have you got
that I've not seen
I've done the earth
and the sky
and the bits in between.
Barnsley, I'm talking Barnsley,
the town that washes white
it's the gateway to the dales
it's the gateway to the moors
and it's the front door of hell
on a Saturday night.
Barnsley, I'm talking Barnsley,
and we're not looking back
Have a picturesque wash
in the old pit baths
and ski down the green pit stack.
Barnsley, I'm talking Barnsley,
it's the Girvan of the South.
If Britain is a body
then Essex is the botty
and Barnsley's the great big mouth.
Barnsley, come to Barnsley,
have a weekend looking round
You can keep your Biarritz
You can stuff Torbay
Barnsley's the place to be found.
Acapulco
Costa Del Sol
Disney World
You can keep them all
Give me Barnsley
The coming destination.
why, I've heard they're even rebuilding the bus and railway station.
Another one with a chorus to learn, all about the wonderful joys of…
BONFIRE NIGHT
Remember, remember the 5th of November
Gunpowder, Treason and Plot,
Sausages, Parkin,
Jacket spuds burning
Running eyes smarting
Lungs filling with smoke.
Dogs bark
Rockets squeal,
We both stare
At a Catherine Wheel
Nailed to a door
It never goes round
Just burns the paint
And drops to the ground
Every year
Always the same
It gets dark
And starts to rain
Me and Ian
At the end of my lawn
Kids inside
Keeping warm.
CHORUS
First few sparks
Faces at the glass
Muffled shouts
Snake in the grass
Roman Candles
Golden Rain
Then him and me
Alone again.
CHORUS
All that money
Up in smoke
Kids indoors
Slurping Coke
It's cold and wet
We've a  boxful yet
And we can't go in
 Till we've lit the lot
CHORUS
