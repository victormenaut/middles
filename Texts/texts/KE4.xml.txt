Right.
ourself, I'm in here one Saturday a week, one, one day a week, right?
Right.
Aha.
And if you, if you've been coming here regularly I don't feel it's a ve a very good service anyway.
But, furthermore, we don't send out recall  
I see, right.
And they should, as well, be able to get everyone to attend their own dentist  so that as you're registered with the doctors  then you should with the dentist.
Right.
And that way, you get  regularly informed and you get a  for twenty four hours.
Right.
And all this sort of thing 
That's right.
will make a difference.
Mm.
So that's why  we haven't, we haven't been in touch with you at all

Yes.

Yes.
the weekend though.

Do you go to the dentist locally?
Aha.
At  Hill.
At  Hill?
Mhm.
I know they're excepting patients for checks there, because they sometimes say  they're still busy

there are so many to think, obviously, at some point that they may cover up so  again, that's where it's designed  the 
Aha.
this guy does it.
Right.
Just straight, that's his living  he designs roofs
Right.
for, for this type 
 
of conservatory that we're paying, so that's why we have to rely on him to do it.
