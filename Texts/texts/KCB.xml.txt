We'll have to do a little  pas de deux here and turn the car around.
The number of times I come off this roundabout onto the wrong road, it's
It's alwa it's always the same isn't it?
It's just one of my habits I think.

Yeah.
I mean, the Anaglypta we're painting looks lovely, but as I say you can re-paint it as it goes 
Yeah.
 
That's right.
And then we're going to make a bi a little bit extra.
I mean, it's lovely!
Well it's the same as our place,a that paper is  as far as I can see is  jet black underneath!
Oh!
Which ones?
The paper in our lounge and in the hall, and tha where you put that piece to cover it up, it's all black under there where it's  wearing on the corners of the wall  where you go round and kno it looks black, so I'm sure it's black underneath and you just 
Where?
Th the  the  the paper through our house  it is actually is black paper and you paint on it.
The cur 
Really?
Yes!
You've got wood chip haven't you, in some places?
It's Anaglypta, yes.
Yes.
Well it's, in the bedroom we're gonna paper it, Anaglypta and paint.

Because, what?
Something, we don't wanna pa paint the walls cos there's so many  like  bits that are wrong with the walls but we want  if we Anaglypta it, it wo 
Yeah.

No.
If we really couldn't find anything for that, so what we'll  like, we're gonna paint it,Anagly An Anaglypta it again

And the it's outside!
Yep!

Mm?
When's 
He's

No, we've had the outside 
He's done it!
painted!
Oh you've done it?
Yes.
That's what I went out to look at.
Oh I see!
Mhm.
Had the whole lot done, he said it'd take about  two and half 
Oh lovely!
days 
Yeah.
and  
That's what I said, a hundred and ninety pound, I said if you could do my house for that I'd be laughing!
I think it's marvellous!
But it's, well considering he had to re-putty all the windows, it wasn't just like he had to one 
I think that is very good!
he had to 
Yeah.
literally
Yeah.
smooth them all 
Well my 
down and go off to .
Mine have got to be re-puttied as well, in places, quite a bit .
Mm.
So yeah, he was very good!
Seemed very good  
Very good apparently round here!
These are now having theirs done but he's done quite a number of them in this area.
Yes.
Good business for him I suppose.
. But then we're going to do the er  garden.
The  
Yep.
and get that done..
Well I've had the mower  serviced.
Yeah?
It looks, it's come back looking  like a brand new mower !
A ne ne ne new one.
No, very good.
No they've really cleaned it up, it looks beautiful!
Good!
Well it's never been serviced since the day we bought it and that must be a good ten years ago.
Mm!
Did you have the blades sharpened and that?
Yes.
Well I put new blades on actually 
Really, really good!
er  and that was one of the problems, I couldn't tighten them, I didn't have
Yeah.
the right equipment because, they're awkward to put on because the nuts are on the top of the  on the top of the blade.
Yeah.
So you gotta get away and underneath and I haven't got the  rer rer the socket spanners that would do it, so  well I haven't got a spanner let alone a socket ones that would do it!
And er 
Do you want a bit of lemon juice in your drink?
Yes please love.
Father.
Yeah.
So, I told them that it had new blades on but they wanted it really tight, and they wanted tightening up and that so  yeah.
I saved them and I put them car engine oil  in !
Which was partly the reason why I wanted it serviced, it
There's yours then.
, moved up the car is it over?
It's okay.
But George 
Yeah, I thought it was very good  with this erm  the thirty six for the servicing plus your part that they
That's better!
I had my er, serviced yesterday.
That wasn't thirty six pounds, I bet?
Er, no, hundred and twenty for  
Ye 
Yes.
But actually, I paid cash and it 
No.
had everything done, it had brakes, had the lot.
Whole lot!
Wish I could get mine done for that!
Well it's a mechanic that we use
Oh.
and er  just did 
Oh!
me a favour.
Running.
Whe then again is yo could I go to Southampton and 
Mm.
and back in it ?
Well exactly!
I expect my car to be  
Of course it does!
Oh well!
Cos I'm doing about what, about three hundred fi three hundred fifty miles a week just going to work and back 
Oh that is  what, fifteen thousand  fifteen to twenty thousand a year isn't it?
You do almost twenty thousand miles a year!
Yeah.
I know.
Bits.
Picks up all 
No.
the mess now in one go.
That's not bad actually Sarah, cos I mean  when I come home for lunch at 
It is when you  
when I come home for lunch  er, and things like that I clock up about  two hundred and twenty, to two thirty, two fifty maybe a week just 
I do forty miles a day 
doing that!
going to work and back.
Yeah.
Yeah but Sarah doesn't use a car  much er 
Oh no.
most of the time.
No that's right.
Do on the odd occasion but
Yeah.
no you just use it for that  and I'm not going anywhere else 
No.
cos once I'm parked, I'm parked.
Well yeah.
No  I mean  but there might be an earlier promotion now.
Oh really?
Wha what this is in the management  side?
Oh yeah, er well  be a different one to that to start with  but it'll be earlier.
What's actually happened is, first of all Tracey's leaving, she's been promoted to Area Telesales Manager for Talking Pages  so she's going up to Slough  and  Michelle will be going for that position, and one other girl    and the two others that are on management development, one is now leaving cos she's like, burnt out, she doesn't want to do it any more  and the other one's going into the field so  it's literally just me and this other girl and Michelle, but I'm obviously just starting, but next time around  it'll just be me again Di , and Dianna  is good at her work
Mm.
but she jus just hasn't got a  personality !
Yeah.
Erm, she's a very aggressive person!
Oh right.
And manner 
Oh yeah.
not, not even like in the right situation, she's like just aggressive all the time and nobody particularly gets on with her or likes her because of this.
And, they do say that they don't feel that  unless she changed her personality
Mm.
she probably wouldn't become a manager, because usually you think you can change and develop but  I think she'll be then be able to become a manager and she'll  sort of learn,but she'd have to  actually change her personality for it.
Would she have to change her personality or not?
Shut up !
But, er, so hopefully Michelle will get this next  Tracey's position, and obviously sort of in  in the meantime and providing her position comes up they  are bringing in a Telesales County Secretary, which wasn't gonna come in for about a year cos they wanted to sort of like, trial it, but now they've decided if that's what they want the position to do  erm  it'll probably happen in the next two months and they said for me to go for it from our division, so I said right, okay.
Oh she won't like that !
That'll be in Southend, will it still?
Mm.
Good!
Well it's actually just basically the team  it's a new position that they've actually made  within each team now, within each division  which is like, you're dealing with higher accounts but a different type of account as well.
Oh, jolly good!
Oh very good!
So
Very good!
It's all looking good!
Sarah?
Sorry!
Ca can I have some sugar?
Do you want sugar?
Yes please.
Do you normally usually have sugar!
She has since 
Yes, in these.
she's been in the hospital.
, bad habit!
In fact, I bought 
I know!
I found in that chemist shop when I was looking there  er, refill Nutrene.
What made you start on sugar again?
So those
Well I I like it.
so she'll be able to refill all those two Nutrene packs, what 
Yeah.
you said, it was one in your purse to take with you and  the one at, the bigger one at home.
Oh erm   and all 
Thank you.
that.
Lovely!
Yeah, that's at home.
It's a sweetener.
Well I can't tell the difference.
No.
No, I like it.
Well you used to.
Mm!
I love it!
How's it going?
Especially  with 
Well 
co a cup of coffee 
it's going well.
Well we got the bill from Mr 
Yeah.
for 
Ah!
Yes!
for your mother's treatment at the hospital  six hundred and sixty pound!
Is that all?
Tha that is the 
Well he's the arthritis man 
just the arthri 
Oh for the arthritis?
The arthritis man, yes!
We haven't got
I was gonna say, for the other one
But we haven't got his yet.
That's gotta be  more than that, cos that's basically what my fares cost.
Well his'll be a thousand pound for the operation, being a major operation, it will be the fact that it's skull.
It'll be very, very expensive.
Well when I had my boob done  including consultation, his was about seven hundred pound.
Mm.
I had my face done, and oh God, it was about five hundred pounds!
Well Mr  was over a thousand pound for the  gall bladder operation 
Yeah.
but
I never 
er 
even knew,that one.
but he won't get that now for it because  they've graded them, so that if it's, it's keyhole surgery type now it's er, it's a lower figure than
Because, you're not actually opening them up.
That's right.
Yeah.
Oh!
So that was the embarrassment I had to do when we went and saw er, Mr erm    I had to say to him, you charge BUPA rates do you?
And, he said yes I do and waved the leaflet at me, he says I know all about that but  but you've got to now otherwise you you 
Mm!
could find yourself let in for two or three hundred pound  because 
Yeah.
BUPA won't pay it.
Well shall we go in the dining room?
Did you know how much I'd lost?
Mm?
Eight pounds.
Did you?
Well a bit more than eight pounds actually, it was over eight pound  over half a stone.
Well not only have you got a bit missing, you hadn't had anything to eat for ages did you?
No, I didn't have anything for five days!
Five days on a fluid diet wasn't it?
Mm!
Most of which was water as well.
Well I don't eat mu very much now do I?
Well no, you don't.
You miss a lot of your meals though.
Yep.
I measured the scar on your mum's tum last night, it's six and half inches without allowing for the
the wrin you know
the wrinkles of the stomach, so I should think it's a good seven inches.
Eh?
Ya.
Big one!
And I'm going to ask Mr  when I see him that  if he
Graeme you can't!
I, course I will!
Oh honestly he's so nice!
I wish you wouldn't ask him that!
If he trained at Saint Swithin's!
Honestly!
Well you remember the film with Ru James  
Mm.
says er, where  the chap put a tentative mark on the stomach and he 
That's Doctor at Large, and Doctor at Sma , at Small isn't it?
I remember that.
That's right.
And he sa 
It was very good!
he berated him for being
Knife happy.
Yeah.
Oh yeah!
He just went, choo!
Sarah?
Like this with the
Well that's the problem I had with my boob wasn't it?
Oh!
The doctor started work the day I went in, and she pre-warned me and I said to him, no big cuts please?
And she said to him, when I got out she said oh, was he knife happy?
He usually is!
I said, yes thanks!
Oh dear!
Watched an interesting programme  the other night on Q E D  er, it was to do with people who  have hare lips and cleft palates
Mm.
where th the a apparently, you know, they put them right as se when you're very young now 
Mm.
but they have found that  in a lot of cases that the  bones starts growing so therefore, when you're  in your late teens, twenties, maturing  your bottom jaw is growing out from the rest of  your jaw bone.
So they had this girl which they showed er, where they had to  break all the bone up under here
Mm.
and rewire it and pull the who 
That's , oh that was on telly weren't it?
Sorry?
That was on telly yesterday.
On Q E D.
Yeah but  but of course this chap has been doing this research in erm  Bangladesh wasn't it, I think?
But, you know, some of the cleft palates you saw and they were
They were terrible!
Oh!
Pull yo co co well you can imagine why people hid themselves away.
And this chap, I mean he was  oh this, it was almost sickening to look at!
Mm
And  this  th th this three surgeons go out from here  and they do all their research on the various and they operate from eight o'clock at night to eight in the morning, non-stop, using three theatres, each doing a forty five minutes  one, and then another one takes 
Cos they can't eat properly with cleft palates anyway
No.
can they?
No.
No.
And this chap in pen, and  it showed them drawing on his  lips when he was anaesthetized where you
Mm.
thought he'd cut and things like this  and then they showed you the chap the next day  and he was completely different!
He he could walk down the street without people looking and staring at him.
They're amazing!
Terrible for them!
They're awful!
Amazing , what they can do now!
But, but they're saying that, ooh apart from I think the  what they're really saying is that it's  better to wait till  in 
You're older.
you're older and do it then 
Mm.
because  as I say,
At least 
it stops growing.
Mm.
Ha!
Are you enjoying yourself there?
Somebody's enjoying it!
I haven't got a vice, but it ha 
Well if you've do , If I'd known I'd have bought you a, a clamp over for you to 
You got that clamp!
Yeah.
Yeah, oh well would help, yeah.
It wouldn't really hold it tight enough.
That should do nice, I've got one here.
Cos I've got the ones that Budgie had like that.
We were going to have Gertrude this afternoon.
Mhm.
No the other way round 
And look after her.
We were gonna go there for tea.
No they didn't!
She asked if we'd go over there for tea this afternoon!
I said no, we're going to Sarah's.
Oh I thought we were going to Sarah's today.
And then I said we were coming to Sarah's, so she sends you her love.
Yes.
I'll send it back.
Say hello to her.
Have they heard from Cara?
I don't know.
I  Cara's 
Well she has done once.
Cara's due back next month.
Mm?
Cara's due back next month.
Yeah?
Yes, I didn't realize that but she's got to come back fo for an exam or something wasn't it?
Yeah 
Mm.
if it's in er  I didn't think she was coming back till July when the term finished, but she's coming back in  I'm sure Gertrude said March.
I think it is March.
Cos she hasn't applied for a green card to work, cos there's point 
Oh hasn't she?
because she's not gonna be there long enough to do it.
Oh!
It can take so long to get one as well!
She'd be better looking for a job, and when she gets  give a 
Yes.
job, getting it then.
Yeah.
I think there's no difficulty over that, in the  area they are, and the hospital they're at.
What's he doing?
Well he's at the sa , he's got the scholarship to this erm  university doing advan an advance degree in  what is it?wood isn't it?
Mm.
I don't know!
Cos that's what he's into.
He's into timbers isn't he?
Is he?
Mm.
Mm.
?
I've no idea!
Well I should think
They reckon that's .
treatments and preservation of the rain forest  and all this  sort of thing, I imagine.
Mm.
Pardon?
Now turn  that.
Well what did 
Yeah so he 
you have to do anyway?
Well our letter box is broken
Yeah.
we decided to get a new one, and use the new numbers.
Now that the  were rather dark for it, so we wouldn't be able 
Oh I see!
to see them.
And er  we went to get one, and measured it and it was right size this box  but 
Mm.
the other one, but  even though it opens outwards, a bit comes in  and a bit comes out and so he had to chip away at the
Oh I see!
door so that it was around to there.
Have you been working since
Well we got back, not very late 
Yeah.
well, I did on Thursday.
I came in yesterday cos I had to decorate it so that er  get it tiled, and get it furnished and 
Yeah.
everything like that.
Monday I've got the dentist.
Ah!
Mm!
I'm not looking forward to it cos I know
Is that Mark?
Yeah.
I know I've got a hole in my     
Ah no!
I'm not looking forward to it!
You can go in there and smile can you now?
Mm.
Your your  cleared the account?
Yeah.
Oh that's alright.
Er, well I, well I've ha well I know, I know who's turn, oh shut up!
Excuse me!
We've got to go and have our teeth done.
Yes I know.
Mine aren't gonna be any problem at the moment are they?
Antony hasn't been to the dentist for about six years!
Antony has got a temporary cap on one of his teeth but he's had it about twice really.
Yeah, if it's 
Good grief!
only a temporary one.
It was when I was about  twelve  I broke the front of my tooth so I   I had a temporary cap put on, and it only lasted six months and came off!
Oh dear!
He put another one and it's been on  since then!
Good 
So 
Lord!
twelve years?
They're only supposed to be sort of six monthly caps.
Good Lord!
Well even a permanent cap  probably wouldn't last that long under normal 
Oh yeah!
circumstances.
I've actually got very strong teeth, they 
Cos er, when Deborah got  Deborah got married, remember when she got married the crown came off mine
Mm.
and I  swallowed it !
Yeah.
I don't, dislike going to the dentist  but  but I'm terrible with dentists, hairdressers, and all these things  though I work quite hard, I never really sort of 
Your dentist is only round the corner from where you work though isn't it?
Oh yes, I know!
Go for a quick
I can't find an 
appointment.

Is it o Get off there!
One of those little   clips.
Oh.
Well there you are you see, he'd forgotten!

Oh i 
 
Hello darling!
Mm mm!
Yes he wa ,wa over there the other lunchtime as we reversed out the drive.
Spoke to us.
I always remember him  he was alright bu but hi his mum was very  sort of quite lenient, and he was really strict.
Really?
Mm.
Laura didn't erm  leave home  she bought a house with Mark about three  two, three years before they got married.
Oh, was that them?
Yes!
Yeah.
She didn't move in until the day she got married.
Really?
She  she stayed there weekends but 
I thought that was funny!
he didn't mind that, but she wasn't allowed to 
No.
actually live there 
Move in.
full-time until she married him.
I thought that was 
Good Lord!
really funny!
Then she was free 
Wasn't they 
to leave home.
in in a flat?
Yeah, but it was  nothing like that.
So er  that's them.
Oh well!
Oh dear!
Sarah, would you make another cup of tea please?
Some in the pot.
Oh would you pour it for me?
Does anyone else want another one?
No I'm fine thank you.
I wouldn't mind another one if there is one, not to worry otherwise.
I

And he said, yes he said er  that place looks lo beautiful inside!
Mm.
I wish ours did!
It will!
Ours is terrible!
Well a they, I mean they, as we say they mo , had everything done in the house before they moved in
That's the ideal 
didn't they?

Yeah that's 
before you move in 
Well that's  that's pretty good!
Pretty good!
Got any letters Sarah?
No.
Do you want to post something through here?
You've been to

Let's have a look.
Oh marvellous!

The very first day he was a bit worried so

Have you pussy?
gets a bit worried.
Don't you 
Hello.
Eh?
Hello.
You're such a soft cat aren't you?
She knows you're soft then she bites you!
There it goes!
Well perhaps if you erm
Sarah?
Hold on!
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Hello!
Ow!
How's things?
Fine.
Just put some lemon
Yep!
please?
Depends what it is really .
Yeah I'd love to be able to
Good Lord!
take that.
That's a lot isn't it?
Actually their  things 
Er sorry , Liz McColgan's just knocked ten seconds off the world record!
Yeah!
Good Lord!
That's a lot 
Their , their telephone is much wo louder than ours.
Yeah, but it's not the same as yours now.
It's not?
No, cos our one like yours is broken
Oh!
and put away for the  
But our , ours builds up, it starts  soft, and then gets louder, and the longer you leave it the louder and louder it gets!
We've got low and high anyway
Yes.
Yeah.
on, on that.
Yeah.
I can't understand ours!
Does your phone you have in the bedroom ring as well?
Yes.
Because we've got 
Yes.
sound down on ours.
Well I've turned the one in the bedroom off for the moment cos if  in the daytime if your mum's up re resting 
Having a rest.
and then it's not  disturbing her  although we've been using the bottom bedroom really.
Although Colin, Colin rang last night, I didn't even know he'd been!
No.
Well if the phone's next to me you  pick it up fairly quickly after it gives it's first beep don't you?
So it's
Yes.
But I've  as I say I've got  memory banks in for  your number and  Gertrude's number and  the three 
Oh yes.
numbers that reach me when I'm not at home and
Yeah.
and things like that so, and Amber and Freda so  all your mum has to do is press M R and the  appropriate number.
The one you want.
Well that's all I have to do I think.
The danger number is five.
Yes.
Cos that's Lyndsey!
They'll be calling me pretty soon and getting me on th 
Is that a good to actually programme that one in then?
I think quite 
Well I don't 
quite honestly it's very, ee, I think somebody's going to have it.
I only did it cos it was such a long number to put in all the
Mm.
time!
I didn't put Debbie's in because, we don't ring New Zealand as much as ring Hong Kong, but  but I've thought of it being a dangerous number but I'm, there it is!
Yeah.
Ah !
We've got loads of numbers on this phone!
They're good these because  if they've got display on them
Yes.
you can put the name in.
Oh!
So er  say I want ring Sarah at work 
Yes.
I put er  er  if I put the first letter of it, er er it's S   that'll search it and it'll say Sarah work
Oh I see!
and then the phone number  then all you've got to do is press send and it'll ring it.
Oh!
And then if I  if I want to ring home  see I'll press  that   that just brings up the
Oh!
yeah, then press that one  is at home  if I just press send
Yeah?
and then it rings it!
Yeah.
That's off your 
 
car is it?
Yeah, this is a car, put that out the way 
Car phone, yeah.
so tha that's all it is!
Yes I see!
Then you just
Vodaphone or whatever it is.
you just plug it in there  and charge the battery up.
Oh!
We got one for the car, you plug it in the cigarette lighter
Yes.
and that fills the battery up.
Great !
They're a little expensive!
Bloody expensive to use as well!
What are?
Mobile phones.
Those phones.
Yes!
Are they?
Yeah, Cellnet phones 
Yeah.
are.
That is  twenty five pound a month  line rental
Yes.
oh it, it depends, I don't think ours, we've actually got twenty five pound at the moment, that's, I dunno, that's, that's what it normally is  and it's twenty five P or thirty 
Ooh!
five P a minute.
Oh yes.
So it's quite expensive.
It is very expensive innit?
Well I know with Arnold and Antony is  Arnold's not so bad cos he uses his quite a bit er  but the tendency with Antony is, when the bill comes in each month  th the rental is double what  the usage is most of the time.
Mm.
Oh we try and use ours  as little as possible but still we've had high bills.
Where's the  love?
In the drawer behind you.
Well I've switched my office phone over and, well they actually wrote to me, but I've switched mine over to this  er  discount, if you do more than a hundred pounds worth a quarter.
Is it Mercury?
Mm.
No, B T.
Oh!
Er, B T.
Come on!
What is it, a regular users'
Yeah.
phone?
Yo you pay to 
Yeah,the they've just brought it in.
you pay for the privilege then don't you?
Oh dear!
Well no, don't pay for any privilege, it's just that they've 
That's for , for Antony.
that they've just  discounted  users.
But you can't  I only get it on line one  because line two  I just use as an a  as an incoming call line, or if I'm .
caught on one and I want to ring out in the other at the same time I can use it.
Doug's got tha , a goo , a good system, which is another new one.
It's it's part of the Star system.
But he he's got a  two lines on one phone
Mm.
and you only need a normal phone
Mm.
er, I suppose it's got one of those R buttons on
Ah yes!
but it's now  erm, if the phone rings and he picks it up ah, er and he's talking to someone on the phone  someone else tries to ring
Yes.
erm  it won't be engaged, they will get a er er er, a erm voice saying  erm  the caller is on another call at the moment please hold the line
Mm.
and, you hear o this, er like three beeps  and if you press the R it will hold wha , the conversation you're on
You're on an you can now go 
and you can speak to the other people, and then you switch back 
Mm, it's 
or, hang up and then the phone will ring and you'll get the other who's 
Mm.
there.
It's quite clever.
But it could be annoying to the person holding on.
And they've got 
cos you've been answered so you start clocking up don't you, at that point?
And they've got a call barring system as well, as well , I like that!
Erm  say, you ca , you can  tap in a code
Yes.
and that phone will be useless, won't be able to ring out on it
Yeah.
or  you can ha , tap another code in and it'll only make local calls  and another code you can only make nationals 
Mm.
Mm.
er , calls in this country  and erm  another code and it, you 
Mm.
can phone anywhere you like  all over the world.
Yeah.
Trouble is with this quarter, with this discount I'm probably  not going to get to a hundred pound at the office because I've been using it at home so much.
Mm!
But I now get er er er, get an itemized bill from  Telecom, so I'll be able 
Yeah.
to  re-charge on the basis of what's been charged.
So what happens, say if you pho , phone the dirty phone numbers?
Th that'll be on.
That's right!
You can, you can find out.
Well I only did it out of curiosity basically to  to see how much  er, one spent in  in calls with th , like Lyndsey in Hong Kong.
Yeah.
And I suppose it's almost
Mind you, that's pre , I've only ever known that 
fifty percent of your phone bill on most occasions.
The only 
Only on 
unusual calls we 
on 
make are er itemized.
on normal phone bills, but er the international calls  international call they do.
Yeah.
Well it only gives you units used though 
Yeah.
it doesn't  tell you the number it went to.
Mm.
And this does you see, you get it with the number.
Do you know all that now?
It's quite interesting that where you think you've  you've rung say, Freda or Amber  in the evening and you've had quite a lengthy conversation in, mentally you think that
Yeah.
and when the bill comes in you find it was only eighty six P or something like 
Yeah.
that.
You expect it to be more like three quid or something.
Yes tha that's right!
And, do you know now, from from Bournemouth  erm 
That's er er, Antony 
frequently used  trunk calls
there's some on the
frequently used trunk calls
Mm.
erm  are not  for example, if you phone  London from Bournemouth it's not  the same band as  if you phoned  erm 
That's right.
Brighton from Bournemouth
That's right.
There are 
because it's 
numbers  there are areas 
Yeah.
now aren't there?
It's  London, Bristol, Yeovil  where else was it?
I wasn't really looking.
But not from
Yes.
they don't do it from  Banford, for example, that's 
Oh!
not the same  exchange.
No.
It must be this new dish that's changed, it must be  I dunno.
Obviously some
I was interested too that  got the new phonebooks
Mm.
at work, and they got all the Mercury numbers in 
Yep!
as well.
Ours has got our mobile number in as well!
Has it?
Yeah.
And it don't cost any more.
No, I know!
You could have one of the
Oh it should have a Mercury numbers in cos all they actually do is rent a B T line and pay for it.
Yes, I know , yes.
So
But th they they  cheaper to use aren't 
Yes.
they?
Not for local, local calls cost a bloody fortune!
Local 
Yes.
calls are do 
Yes.
about three, four times as expensive
Yeah.
but er
Local calls are a fortune  when you think
Yeah.
if you've got no B T lines.
Yes, it's only on erm  trunk calls that you really
Mm.
score isn't it?
In fact, I think in Bournemouth you can actually make locals on Mercury now at the normal rate which is good!
Well you might be able to get long distance  
I think it's all a bit complicated for me!
I can't understand it all!
Well what used to be simple and straightforward now leaves you with th wondering whether you got the right card in your pocket 
Mm.
or something doesn't it?
Mm.
We haven't had a phone call so it must be good!
Mustn't it?
Are you going to explain this to them?
No,wha why, we'll talk later on, don't worry now.
Oh thank you.
Mm.
I was watching the ice hockey on here last night, last night, the   and Czechoslovakia one  and a Canadian guy scored a goal  and the announcer said they'll be celebrating that in his home in Canada if they're watching, listen I bet they are!
He's got seven brothers, and  five sisters!
I said oh !
Can you imagine!
I'd like to be their mothers!
I bet you would, yes!
Yeah !
Big money!
You might be their money when they're all at work.
Yes.
Be alright  on your birthday!
Yeah I suppose it wa , it's like Maureen's parents, both her mum and her dad are like, children of thirteen!
Yes.
I think, Maureen, I remember when we were about fifteen, at the last count she had forty nine first cousins!
Wha 
Really?
Let alone second cousins, but first cousins, she had 
Heavens!
forty nine!
Good grief!
And they all buy each other Christmas presents!
Oh dear!
Oh no!
Oh dear!
But he couldn't!
Yes.
Oh, ho ho ho ho!
How awful!
I don't even send my cousins Christmas cards, let alone the 
Can you imagine it though!
I mean
Even if you only spent a quid, a couple of quid that's two hundred, er it's 
Even with the uncles, even with your aunt 
hundred pound isn't it!
Even with your aunts and uncles 
Well you spend a lot money 
and their other 
Mm.
halves, you're looking at  forty eight?
Yeah.
No,mo more.
There's thirteen each side 
Yeah.
so that's twenty six 
Must be wonder 
so that's fifty two 
Mm.
aunts and uncles
Mm.
But still 
 
think of the presents you're getting  too !
Yeah!
Yeah,yo you get out a bank loan to do it, and then you ask for it, then you ask them for money for  Christmas, to pay it back off !
Can you imagine what weddings are like!
Can you imagine?
But er, nobody else can come the church is full of family !
But er  most of them , but she's got a couple over here, I think.
You'd have thought that with a family er that big they wouldn't be like with cousins.
I don't,sh 
 
I don't think like more in, each kid in each family will buy  each  kid in every family
No.
their actual cousin to cousins, but the aunts and uncles of the family, they all buy each person a present.
Mm.
But it's still a hell of a lot of presents!
Yes!
Quite!
Cor!
Start buying after th 
They're co sweeping the carpet up.
The mess.
As long as she doesn't sweep us away!
Stop it!
No.
Catch!
No, that's the car business Antony.
Bloody awful!
If you say so.
What do say Sarah?
Yeah!
Bloody!

Something you'd like?
You're going to get the drill and have a go at the drilling session?
Mm?
He likes the drills.
Oh cutie!

Th , the trouble with Felix is when you're doing something he likes to be there.
Oh course he does!
That's right!
And I was in upstairs 
It's interesting!
and he 
That's wha that's what our cat does.
Yeah.
I'll have to wallpaper your bathroom, then paint it, I then have to touch up the door  cos it's that kind of paint  and I had it like, on the top of the loo, I was doing it up a bit, and the next thing I saw was Felix coming onto the back of the wind ah 
Oh!
window and I sort of pinged the cat's tray, you know, if I shut the door and walked back in and hid the paint on the side, and on a couple of occasions he was painting that window and suddenly this cat appeared outside 
Oh dear!
on the ledge!
It's like the man who was doing  putting the two new windows in.
Oh God!
Put the glass in  and he kept coming and si sit, trying to get on the bloody windowsill and getting out!
I bet!
But Antony was doing it and you put her on the tumbledryer behind him, and it was so funny cos  he's like this  with his head going round Antony looking, every 
Oh!
time Antony looked round he went  like this to 
Yeah.

You never look !
 
Oh!
And his head was going back round watching.
He likes to get involved.

Sounds like you had no brake pad in it whatsoever!
They were finished and  which is the main reason to have it serviced.
Gotta go back to the .
 
Actually, I've noticed that once or twice today.
Yeah,we well it could be  one of two things that's all.
Could be a bit of dirt on the pad which  squeaks, that's all.
Unfortunately, brake pads nowadays, they're not allowed to put asbestos in any more.
No.

Remember when we went on that  caravan trip up to the  and we got dirt on the brake drums at

Don't

Don't think I'll ever be the same again really!
No.
I don't.

on both of them.
Well, I had to go to Westbourne again, to the  to the laser  you know?

So you got four husbands now?
Oh God!

Aren't you lucky!
four husbands asleep!
 
Oh I see!
Yeah, cos he's been a great help to me!
 
He told me he would of put mum on   more or less 
That's funny !
No, not really.
No, but Kenneth's not what you call very helpful, if you know what I mean?
He thinks he's better keeping out the way,she'll 
Well I don't know what he thinks really.
He's so used to me doing everything that 
Does it, yeah.
That is my fault, I suppose.
But then I'm used to him doing all the  sort of gardening and  I mean, I wouldn't think of doing that, or decorating, you see.
Mm.
He's got a lot of matches this week, he's got  he was on duty last night from six to ten, this morning he's got a match, tonight he's got a match!
Yeah.
One Wednesday, one Friday morning.
It's either all or nothing at all down there.
Yeah.
Coming to the end of the season now 
What is it ?
and they got a lot to get in, you know  before they start going 
Where's Zara?
outdoors.
Sitting there!
Of course they get covered mud and  
That's where Ken and Zara went on Saturday night.
T V. 
Yeah.
Did you know that Graeme?
Sorry,yo , no?
Royal bowls on T V this week.
Oh is there?
Every day 
Oh.

So 
Erm 
you know 
need to keep him awake do I?
But of course, I mean  mm?
Do we keep him awake do I?
Well I keep threatening if he does fall asleep I'm not gonna wake him up!
It's funny how he manages  to keep awake!
Er, when he comes off tonight just after two hours, say to him now don't drop off!
I won't!
I won't!
Oh it's coming from Preston!
It used to be in Bournemouth, they had it at Bournemouth for quite a few years.
Yeah.
Bu but David  was playing yesterday and erm  forget who he was playing, but David  lost.
Did you want coffee Graeme?
Yes please er
Oh!
But of course, you know he's sitting there saying, you know all woods and  ooh it's 
Yes that 
wide, or it's too short or  .
But he's going to watch it at his mothers  
I keep having a conversation !
And how have you been?
Alright?
Good!
Thanks Hazel.
Do you want 
Alright.
any more?
No thank you love.
Ooh!
Ooh!
We've decided now that you  you mustn't treat me like a chi child.
Don't you feel better, feel much better?
Well you know what I mean!
 
Yeah.
I thought so.
Did you see, hear, see what I said?
Gotta be a bit understanding  
Yes, I heard what you said!
I'm just wondering why why 
Hazel , Hazel thinks you shouldn't treat me like a child!
Do you Hazel?
I think you should let her get on with it Graeme.
The then she'll, she'll realize what she's missing!
She'll miss it.
Yeah?
Do you know what I mean?
Well I do a lot!
Well I do, I do let her get on with it, but I  have to make sure that she doesn't
Wait, wait for it!
Wait for it!
overdo it you see.
Yeah.
And end up falling flat on her face or something like that!
Yeah, perhaps it'll be a good thing actually!
In fact she's just complained about what you're 
That's right!
doing for her !
Oh!
No, yeah I'll come with you , you go off and stay with Joyce, look after her for a little while and let  Kenneth sort things out !
Look after me?
Yes, I I think that she might appreciate .
Yeah.
Actually, I don't really mi mind him looking after me, he's very good!
But I I don't like being treated like a child!
You're not treated li 
Oh I'm sure we don't treat you like that!
I wouldn't mind someone doing the cooking!
Ha , I hear you're a good cook?
Oh he loves, loves cooking!
Well that's what's annoying ,I got the help  !
Yeah but
I don't stop her doing it if she wants to!
Ann hasn't 
Oh Graeme!
Ye 
Ann hasn't done a lot of cooking for a long time though, have you really?
Because of the  whatever you call it
Well
I do do 
Oh yes!
Yeah she gets, she gets the evening 
I do the ones that 
meals and 
ev evening meals, things like 
and often a
that.
the lunches over weekend.
So, the thing is you shouldn't be such a good cook Graeme!
That's right!
That's the trouble!
That's what I tell everybody, when they say to me, oh no,you know, we never go out for a meal!
I say well  shouldn't be such a good cook!
I mean, there's quite a few husbands I know that absolutely hate being out!
They only like their wives' 
 
cooking!
And I said, you know, well  if you weren't a good cook, he'd be glad to  go out and have one !
Ah, but that's no consideration for the cook then is it?
Cos she would like to go out and have a meal 
Yeah.
that somebody else has 
Yes, that's it!
cooked, shouldn't she?
That's right!
Yeah.
Yeah.
Morning Zara!
How are you?
Or is it good afternoon now, isn't it?
Yeah.
Well, did you enjoy Saturday night?
Yes!
It was quite good!
Good!

You know that bit when  in the last act where they're  sometimes sticking together 
Oh yes!

Oh!
Well tha , they did that quite well I thought.
Yeah!
Doing it properly in that.
Yeah.
Didn't have an awful of trouble with that  six er, six pages of dialogue which  sometimes they're speaking together and sometimes they're
speaking alternately.
they're they're speaking alternately and er, it was 
Oh dear!
it was very difficult!
Mm.
Very difficult
Needs good 
indeed!
timing doesn't 
Oh.
it?
Yes.
Oh Yes.
Yeah.
And er, it was bit sort of not the place to learn yo , forget your lines!
No way!
It's a bit sort of stilted.
Ah!
Well there 
But 
you are!
er  apart from that  it all went very well.
The set was quite ingenious, I thought!
Aha.
Yeah , it was pretty good, it was
Yes.
The erm, bed-sit sort of on a raised bit
Yeah.
you know?
Yeah.
The sitting room was on a  at the stage.

Actually, they they  they did one car
Going away.

and didn't come back.
on the wrong si , it was on the wrong side
Yeah.

Was it a ?
No!

Hello.
Hello Neil!
Hello Barbara.
All the best!
Yep, er yeah 
 
isn't it shocking!
Yeah.
Hello!
Yeah.
Hi!
Oh, it's a
just trying to sort out this business of this  the offices  that we're being let in the Strand Theatre that er  people are moving in this week and they've got no authority to move you see.
Really?
This is what Ni , I spoke to Nigel about on the phone on Friday and said he could 
Yeah.
stop it, so  so he had to erm  just talk to our solicitors this morning and try and get this sorted out  between the two solicitors.
Did you get through to him?
Yes, yes, got through.
Well not David it's a er, Susan   got 
Mm.
Susan.
Have you read it now cos I shall have to 
Hello!
So erm 
take it back?
I can't do it, can you do these
How have you been, alright?
That a bathroom cabinet up there?
 
so they're, you know, explain the situation to her because it's between the two solicitors to sort out now and get the writ, writ sorted out before  anything could be signed to  to allow them to  move in.
Yeah.
It's a tricky situation actually because
Well what do you say the 
the lease 
the ?
well th the, the people who have the actual lease of the offices  have gone out o er  gone out of business in a sense, they're no longer operating  and  because, they were part of a bigger organization, that bigger organization guaranteed the rents.
Now this bigger or , this other organization which  wants to put th er  another tenant in as in a, as a sub-let to their lease
Yeah.
and, I am saying that  they haven't got the lease
Yeah.
even though they might be part and parcel of the same organization, they are not the leaseholders so they can't  make the arrangements, so if they want to make the arrangement they must have the lease assigned to them first, then we will come to terms with them over land and to under le under let.
Yeah.
But, you know, they're just being  going on as if they are  i in a position to grant
To do.
to do!
And, having said that we haven't, at this moment, approved an under-let anyway, so
No.
But, you know, the situation is difficult in that  if the  people did move in there's  not a lot you can do about it because  it would mean that  you would have to surrender the lease, which means you've let  the guarantors off the hook for paying the then  and you're left without a tenant whatsoever.
Erm it's, it's trying to get an amicable solution to it.
Yeah.
Oh.
Darling, will you get me a  a scone, another scone  teacake 
Teacake.
Aha.
and erm  and a  coffee.
Okay.
Okay.
Can you er pay, pay 
Ye yes.
er
Yep.
Teacake, I don't remember  ooh ah, toasted teacake, oh it's fifty five.
What do you have, tea or coffee?
Coffee.
Coffee?
Hundred and seventeen, a hundred and seventy two again isn't it?
So I will pay that.
What have you done to yourself that hurts?
Put my back out again!
Put your back out?
Yeah.
Oh!
One seventy two.
Is it?
Oh right!
Thank you madam.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You oft are you?
I'm off now, yes.
Okay then.
Mm.
Yes, yes 
Anything 
yes.
exciting at the office?
No!
Oh well, yes.
Well lots of mail.
Lots of mail?
Lots of mail.
An interesting situation which I've just explained to Ann, whereby at the weekend  there's a set of offices in the Strand Theatre which  the company that we're operating from there so stopped 
Can you manage?
business
Yeah.
but they're part of a much bigger organization who 
Mm.
was guaranteeing the rent, so the rent  has been paid even 
Paid.
though the office 
Yeah.
has been vacated  and they wanted to grant an under-let to another
Yeah.
body of people to try and reduce the rent they were paying  erm  but it, it's er, it's initially a difficult situation that we have said yes we don't mind you  erm  we don't mind granting you that, but  we want to know  if you will accept an assignment of the lease  from the previous company cos 
Mm.
from our point of view  in nineteen ninety three, we have to deal with somebody over a revision of the rent  and if the company doesn't exist  it makes it very difficult!
Yeah!
Yeah.
Quite!
Yeah.
You see, so  these people were going to move in at the weekend so had to put a stop to that cos they had no authority to move in there  until the solicitors try and get this thing sorted out.
I wonder what they'll do?
But it ma , it's a  it leaves you this interesting situation in that  if  they had moved in  what do you do, cancel the lease and get them out?
Which means the guarantor no longer has to pay you the rent so you  you don't really want to forego that either, yeah.
So you really, bit of a clever stick aren't you?
Yes.
Yeah.
Very, very .
However, it'll all come out.
It'll come out in the wash I guess!
Right , yes.
So there we are.
There we are.
Well thank you for your company this morning madam.
Thank you, yes.
And erm  It was nice!
Oh I enjoyed sitting 
Yeah.
with you!
Cos we weren't that busy that we were able to devote a little bit of time.
Ta time.
Oh good!
Jolly good!
It's lovely!
It was very nice.
Yep.
So, we'll go home now.
Yeah.
We'll go home.
Go home  to a nice tough, clean house shall we?
Thank you.
Yeah, it's nice when you walk in 
Yeah.
and it's all clean 
Lovely!
and sparkling 
That's right, yeah.
isn't it?
Yeah.
Look after yourself.
Yes.
You too.
Right.
See you tomorrow then 
She was let off
yeah.
she was let off lightly this morning cos there was hardly any  ironing to be done you see, because I haven't worn 
Oh, so she had that.
shirts all week really.
So she can have a little bit to do  
That's right.
Bye bye love!
Yeah.
See you then!
Bye!
Take care.
See you so 
Bye!
Bye bye Hazel.
Erm  things getting, getting re relative to grow up and quite honestly I can't really get ma man imagine growing up I can't at all.
Well I don't remember it being any hassle for me.
No I don't.
My mum and dad were nice, they never used to make life hard for us and if we wanted to go out, all they wanted to know is where we were going
That's right.
and perhaps who we were going with, you know.
Well we, we were so happy everybody
Mm
and we were always told if we wanted to, we could take anybody home
That's right
Mm
but I don't remember any hassle about it at all 
I don't either , I don't either, I don't either, at all.
We had , we had limits on what time to be back
Well yes
yes, you know unless 
yes, er 
it was a special occasion which they, then they'd accept that you'd be back after midnight, but
Yes, that's it, that's right
Mm
but if you were reasonable with them they were reasonable with you, I, I can't understand young people of today 
We were very 
it's the same when, when, when our kids were young and they were quite good weren't they?
Mm
Well it was like Zara 
really 
I used to try and not say er, you know, to make her feel uncomfortable and that sort of thing, but I did use to draw the line when they used to be eleven and half past eleven saying goodnight and I had to get up at half past, six o'clock, seven o'clock 
Oh yes 
in the morning and go to work 
morning, that's right , yeah
so I was started work then and I said well look I just can't do it and then
