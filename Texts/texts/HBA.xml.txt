To all shareholders and loan stock holders of Waterford Wedgwood plc
Report and Accounts 1992 â€” Erratum
On 28 May we informed the company that, inadvertently, we omitted the following paragraph from our Report to the Members on page 14 of the Waterford Wedgwood plc Report and Accounts 1992:
The net assets of the Company, as stated in the balance sheet on page 18, are more than half of the amount of its called-up share capital and, in our opinion, on that basis there did not exist at 31 December 1992 a financial situation which under Section 40(1) of the Companies (Amendment) Act 1983 would require the convening of an Extraordinary General Meeting of the Company.
We apologise for this oversight.
