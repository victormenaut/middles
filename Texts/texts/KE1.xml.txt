Have they got any songs organised or anything?
No, no.
That's normal.

Madness.
Just old stuff er

He should have kept the studio in time for some   
And have a practice  of some sort.
Yeah.
Like when they're having 
Not, not , no not their own stuff.
I mean, stuff that they  your cover versions and stuff, you know,

Oh I know but, if I was getting studio time there's no way I'd be going through the 
You wanna do your own stuff.

I think we'd be better ourselves, like!
Never heard this.
Yeah I
I dunno.
Ah!
Wouldn't you know like!
Ah!
Fuck you would!
I fucking would now!
You wouldn't like, cos you know and  saying, saying there if you would like.
But I wouldn't!
Then  you know what, ah seriously  I couldn't 
Cos everybody else did.
I wanted to.
You would have 
I say 
been the only one who wouldn't go.
I'd say yeah I would.
I would and all, you know.
Ha!
No one else.
Like, don't tell me that I tried to get a .

They got a small, really small casing.
You should have  I'm gonna have to go in and get me a  a double bass like.
It's .
Got this double bass and he's talking about like .
He didn't push,your weight on it.
They reckon they've got about four songs down recorded and mixed in four hours!
No way!
they'll be lucky to get one done.
And they'll be  something like a hundred quid  for a single.
Well Mark says they've got twenty songs prepared like.
Twenty?
Yeah.
Twenty?
In four hours?
 
No way!
No , three.
Three hours?
Fuck that!
We got  what?

You know why?
When I told them that you's got about three and mixed up 
We did three in six hours, and we were  alright at the time.
Cos we all knew what we were doing.
Well!
Three in six hours?
Mm.
Wow!
It's a lot, lot longer than you think Steve.
I mean 
I I knew it'd be longer, but it doesn't take fucking, takes three hours to do one song!
Well it didn't.
I mean I I had the guitar stuff done within an hour but it getting all  vocals over-dubbed and doubling everything up and then, it took forever to mix it together.
But we did it really good!
You had to it all yourself or
Alright, we're in a forty odd track  studio !
Wah!
I didn't wanna to do anything, you know.
No!
The guy did it know what I mean, but  just takes a hell of a lot longer to mix like.
He ended up costing me something good   more like!
It was twenty five to ten or something.
But we wouldn't have done it unless we needed it  copied down.
Couldn't get it .
That's the only reason why we did it.
Mm.
See  you heard Ghost Devils?

You think they'd be a bit better than they are.
Mm.
Did they take passports up to, up to 
Oh God!
That's the most horrible thing Steve that thing!
What,or something?

like Eddie Van Halen!
He came down on his knees to do a solo really because he can't actually play to back me up!
 
 
Fucking joke !

And the three amp will do what like?
With the reverb on the amp as well as the one on the drum machines I'll say  God damn heavy!
Seriously!

We went swimming with Jonathan the other night and he got up on the top board and sort of and he was sort of like hanging on to the bar like this  looking over 
Oh god, that's  like.
and he couldn't do it and the worse thing was everybody in the pool had gone  go on 
What, what happened was Robert, Rob and me shouted, Robert  and me were there and who was it, Helen was there I think as well, his ex girlfriend  we were going  go on Jon, go on jump   and everybody in the pool started it  go on Jonathan  
and he couldn't do it, he was so totally embarrassed and all the rest of it, he had to get down and everybody was  boo boo, chicken, chicken

Great stuff.
So what's the trick to the solo on there?
I don't know like, some of it's just real hard, most of it's just easy anyway it goes in the big diddly diddly diddly bit at the end, just     
stuff's no problem but er once it starts  and get the medium stuff done as well 
And there's the bit
so that when he gets up 
three of my frets on the bottom string that you can't bend up, I don't know what's wrong.
And you hit it and it bends up and it just dies  and I've been sitting like, I mean I, I definitely don't think that it is anything with the way I hold it in like cos I've been sitting going  and I just, just hit it and it goes ee, it just dies so you can't bend, that's on  too.
Och it might be  I dunno  it might be with you bending it  that there's a bump on that string.
Yeah on the, that's a thought,
I think
