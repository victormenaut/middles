‘Some people go to exciting places,’ thinks Anna.
‘Why can't I?’
Anna lives in Rome.
It is the summer and there are a lot of people on holiday.
She wants to go away for a holiday, too.
Carl Bixman is in Rome with his mother and father.
They are on holiday.
‘Look!’ says Carl.
‘My picture is in the newspaper!’
American boy, Carl Bixman, meets the Princess.
‘We came to this bar some days,’ says Carl, laughing.
‘But to meet a princess is a nice surprise!’
Carl's father is the famous American magician, Theodore Bixman.
Look at the newspaper carefully.
Can you find a picture of Carl's father?
Carl is walking along the road to Bar Capri with his mother.
‘Be careful, Carl!’ calls his mother.
Anna can't stop.
She doesn't hit Carl but she comes off her bicycle.
‘I'm sorry!’ says Carl.
‘Look before you walk onto the road,’ says Anna.
She is angry.
‘It's dangerous.’
‘I'm sorry,’ says Carl again.
‘Are you all right?
Is your bicycle OK?’
‘I'm all right,’ says Anna.
‘Come and sit down in the bar,’ says Mrs Bixman.
‘We can get you a drink.’
‘What's your name?’
Mrs Bixman asks Anna.
Anna tells her.
‘I live in Rome,’ she says.
She looks at Carl.
‘What's in that newspaper?
Something interesting?’
Carl gives Anna the newspaper and she reads about the princess, and about Carl.
‘I know your father's name,’ Anna says.
‘He's very famous.’
‘He's making a TV programme now,’ says Carl.
‘It's going to be on TV tonight.’
‘Next week, we're going to Paris,’ says Mrs Bixman.
‘The week after, to Madrid.’
‘Paris!’ says Anna.
‘How exciting!’
‘Holidays are OK,’ says Carl.
‘But this afternoon we're going to the shops.
I don't want to go.’
‘I'm going to the zoo,’ says Anna.
‘Can I come?’ asks Carl, suddenly.
Anna is surprised.
‘All right,’ she says.
‘Meet me here at four o'clock.’
Somebody is watching Carl and his mother at Bar Capri.
Look at the picture.
Who is it?
Carl and Anna go to the zoo.
There are a lot of people.
Anna sees a man with one arm, watching them.
‘Is that man following us?’ thinks Anna.
Later, Anna and Carl are in St Peter's Square.
Suddenly, Anna sees the man with one arm again.
He is with a second man.
The second man is wearing sunglasses.
‘Look!’ she says to Carl.
Carl looks, but he can't see the men.
‘What's wrong?’ he asks.
‘I…
No, it's nothing,’ says Anna.
‘Perhaps the men aren't following us,’ she thinks.
‘Perhaps they're only people on holiday.’
‘Can we meet tomorrow?’ asks Carl.
‘OK,’ says Anna.
She likes the young American.
‘Meet me at Bar Capri, at eleven o'clock,’ says Carl.
That evening, Anna watches television and sees Carl's father.
The magician is doing his famous trick — the Underwater Disappearing Trick.
Anna watches the girl under the water.
Minutes later, the girl disappears!
‘How does he do it?’ thinks Anna.
Look at the TV pictures.
They are not in the right order.
Put them in the order that Anna sees them.
The next morning, Anna goes to Bar Capri.
‘Carl is late,’ she thinks.
Anna asks for some coffee.
‘Where's my friend, the young American?’ she asks.
‘He comes here some days.’
‘I know the boy,’ says the woman.
‘He and the man are not here now.’
‘What man?’ asks Anna.
Suddenly, she is afraid.
‘The man with one arm.
He comes to the bar and sits at the table there by the tree.’
‘Your young friend arrives.
The man goes and talks to him.’
‘Soon after, they drive away with another man in a black car.’
‘That's strange,’ thinks Anna.
‘Where are they now?’
The man with one arm loses something.
Can you see it?
Anna sees something under the table by the tree.
She reads it.
‘Is this from the man with one arm?’ she thinks.
‘Perhaps Carl is at the Antonella Theatre.’
Anna finds the Antonella Theatre.
It is a small building.
‘Can I help you?’ asks the man at the door.
‘I want to see Lorenzo Mancarelli, please,’ says Anna.
Look at this picture.
Can you find: Madame Boffa, Flavio Lupio, Lorenzo Mancarelli, and Nicole LeToul?
A man comes out of the theatre and calls ‘Taxi!’ to a car that is going by.
The man is Lorenzo Mancarelli.
The taxi stops and Mancarelli goes across.
‘Signor Mancarelli!’ says Anna.
‘Can I speak to you?’
Lorenzo Mancarelli stops.
‘What do you want?’ he asks Anna.
‘I'm looking for my friend, Carl Bixman,’ says Anna.
The magician suddenly looks afraid.
‘I — I don't know him,’ he says.
‘Do you know a man with one arm?’ says Anna.
Mancarelli's face is white and he is angry.
‘No!
Go away!’ he says.
‘Take me to la piazza Rosa,’ he tells the taxi driver.
‘Number five.’
‘He's not a very nice man,’ says Anna.
‘No, he's not,’ says the man at the theatre door.
‘He says things and they're not true.
He does know a man with one arm.’
‘How do you know?’ says Anna.
The man tells her.
‘It is Saturday of last week.
I'm standing here and a car stops across the road.
Lorenzo Mancarelli is in the car.
He's giving a second man some money.
The second man has only one arm.’
‘Where is la piazza Rosa?’ asks Anna.
‘I don't know it.’
The man at the door goes into the theatre and comes back with a map.
He shows Anna la piazza Rosa on the map.
Can you find la piazza Rosa on the map?
‘Be careful,’ the man tells Anna.
‘Lorenzo Mancarelli wants to be a famous magician.
‘Nobody can stop me!’ he says.
I think he's crazy.
And dangerous.’
Anna arrives at la piazza Rosa and finds number five.
She watches the house.
Suddenly, she sees a man near an upstairs window.
‘The man with one arm!’ says Anna.
‘But where is Carl?
Is he in the house, too?’
Anna goes to the back of the house and finds a fire escape.
She goes up the fire escape and looks into the upstairs rooms.
Lorenzo Mancarelli is writing a letter.
Here is the first page.
Can you read it?
‘How can Carl get out of that room?’ thinks Anna.
Lorenzo Mancarelli finishes writing his letter.
‘Take this to Bixman's hotel,’ he tells One-Arm.
One-Arm leaves the house and walks away with the letter.
Five minutes later, the man with sunglasses comes out of the house and goes to the black car in the road.
He opens the door, does something in the car, then takes something from the front.
He looks at it and is angry.
The man looks at the upstairs window of the house.
‘Mancarelli!’ he calls.
Mancarelli looks out of the window.
‘What is it?’
‘I'm going to get some cigarettes,’ says the man with sunglasses.
‘Lock the car,’ Mancarelli tells him.
‘And put on the alarm.’
‘OK, OK!’
The man does something in the car again.
‘He's putting on the car alarm,’ thinks Anna.
Then the man locks the car door and walks down the street.
‘Only one man in the house now,’ thinks Anna.
‘Can I make him come out?
Then perhaps Carl can get out.’
Suddenly, she remembers something about the car.
‘I can get the man out of the house!’ she thinks.
‘But Carl is in a locked room.
He can get out of the window, but how can he get across to the fire escape?’
Suddenly, she sees something.
‘Now I know!’ she says.
How can Anna get the man out of the house?
How can Anna get Carl from the window of the room to the fire escape?
Anna gets the ladder from the house along the road.
She breaks the window of the black car — and the car alarm goes off!
It makes a lot of noise.
Lorenzo Mancarelli hears the alarm and runs down to the road.
Anna quickly runs to the back of the house with the ladder.
‘Carl!
Quickly, come across to the ladder! says Anna.
‘I'm coming,’ says Carl.
‘Be careful!’
She says.
Anna puts the ladder back again.
Then she and Carl run to get the police.
Ten minutes later, One-Arm arrives back at the house.
‘What's wrong with the car?’ he asks.
Mancarelli tells him about the broken window.
‘But it doesn't matter,’ he says.
‘The Underwater Disappearing Trick is the only thing that matters.
How does Theodore Bixman do it?
I have to know!’
‘Is the boy OK?’ asks One-Arm.
‘He's quiet,’ says Mancarelli.
‘Later, he can have something to eat.’
There is something the men do not see.
What is it?
Suddenly, there is a lot of noise in the street.
One-Arm runs to the window and looks down.
‘It's the police!’ he says.
‘What!’ says Mancarelli.
‘How do they know we're here?’
‘It's the boy!’ says One-Arm.
‘He's in one of the police cars!’
‘How can he be?’ says Mancarelli.
‘He — he's in the next room.’
‘The men think that I can do disappearing tricks, too!’ thinks Carl.
Theodore Bixman and his wife ask Anna to come to the hotel.
‘Thank you for helping Carl,’ says the magician.
He gives something to Anna.
She is surprised, but very happy.
‘Thank you!’ she says.
‘Carl says you can do tricks with ladders,’ laughs Theodore Bixman.
‘You're a magician, too, Anna!’
What does Theodore Bixman give to Anna?
Can you see it in the picture?
