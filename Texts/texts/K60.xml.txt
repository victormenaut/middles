The clergy daughters' school at Cowan Bridge  run by the Reverend William .
Charles and Emily followed a couple of months later.
Maria was eleven, Elizabeth, nine, Charlotte, eight, and Emily, six.
But the Reverend  was fiercely repressive of the children's spirit, the food was very poor  and the girls were often starved  and  cold .
Well starved and stark because
Yes.
Yes.
starved at least.
Erm, I'm sure  erm  Abby  is, is supposed to be a fairly accurate representation of what it was like at school.
Maria developed T B, and died at home in eighteen twenty five, aged twelve.
And Elizabeth, a month later aged ten.
And then their father brought Charlotte and Emily home for good.
The four children invented imaginary countries and characters and threw themselves fiercely into it.
With Branwell and Charlotte especially er, developing a country called Angria.
And Emily and Anne, a country called Gondal.
In eighteen thirty one Charlotte was sent to the, to Roe Head School at  Murfield She was at first homesick, but eventually carried off three prizes.
She left the following year having exhausted all the tuition the school could offer.
In eighteen thirty five she returned as a teacher, her salary to pay for first Emily's, and then Anne's tuition there.
In eighteen thirty seven Emily became a governess, and then, so did Anne and Charlotte.
In forty one, Charlotte and Emily travelled to Brussels to become pupils at the   Mes en des occasion pour les jeune desmoiselles Er, Charlotte fell in love with the principal, but he didn't reciprocate.
Erm  and she returned, when she returned as a teacher without Emily  in forty three.
And she returned home  desolate the following year .
Er, I'm sure you remember about Anne's little  erm, encounters and Thorpe Green, and how Branwell got into trouble.
Back home, together, finally, the sisters published their collective poems under the aliases of Currer Ellis, and Acton Bell in eighteen forty six.
Erm, in September eighteen forty eight, Branwell died of T B aged thirty one.
In December, Emily, aged thirty, and in May, forty nine, Anne aged twenty nine.
Charlotte was then left alone with her father.
She wrote Shirley, and Villette.
Became very well known, and a friend of Mrs Gaskell.
Married her father's curate, against his snobbish wishes, in eighteen fifty four  the Reverend Arthur Bell Nicholls.
Honeymooned in Ireland where her husband came from.
And died almost certainly of excessive sickness in pregnancy aged thirty nine.
Er, her father lived on for another six years.
And Nicholls returned to his family home in Ireland.
The Professor was published posthumously in eighteen fifty seven .
I'm sure this is all very familiar territory.
Brontes' lives are almost sort of erm  part of British history aren't they?
You know .
Right.
Erm  Would anyone like to give us a plot resume in Jane Eyre?
I could read it from the Oxford
 
History of English Literature if nobody wants to do it.
Shall I read it?
Yes.
The heroine, a penniless orphan has been left to the care of her aunt, Mrs Reed.
Harsh and unsympathetic treatment rouses her defiant spirit and a passionate outbreak leads to her consignment to Lowood Institution.
There, consoled for the severity of the regime by the kindness of the superintendent Miss Temple, and a fellow orphan, Helen Burns  she dies in Jane's arms of, who dies in Jane's arms of consumption  she spends her miserable years, eventually becoming a teacher.
On Miss Temple's marriage, she obtains a post as governess at Thornfield Hall, to Adele the illegitimate daughter of Mr Rochester, a Byronic hero of grim aspect and sardonic temper.
Rochester, despite Jane's plainness, is fascinated by her sharp wit and independence, and they fall in love.
After much resistance, she agrees to marry him.
But 
 
on the eve of their wedding her wedding veil is rent by an intruder, who Rochester assures her is a servant Grace Poole  but who is the next day revealed to be his mad Creole wife Bertha, confined to the upper regions of the hall for years, whose unseen presence has long disturbed Jane.
The marriage ceremony is interrupted by Mrs Rochester's brother from the West Indies.
And despite Rochester's full confession and pleadings with Jane to stay with him, she flees.
After nearly perishing on the moors, she is taken in and cared for by the Reverend St John Rivers and his sisters Mary and Diana.
It is, emerges that they are her cousins and that Jane has inherited money from an uncle.
The legacy is equally divided between the four.
Under pressure from earnest appeals and strong personality of the dedicated Rivers, Jane nearly consents to marry him and share his missionary vocation in India, but is prevented by a telepathic appeal from Rochester.
She returns to Thornfield Hall to find the building burned, and Rochester blinded and maimed from his attempt to save his wife from the flames.
She marries him, and in the last chapter we learn that his sight is partially restored .
I know it's always the way with plot resumes, but there are actually one or two minor mistakes there aren't there?
I found one 
Yes.
immediately!
Well I may say so.
Yes do.
I understood Rochester said to Jane  that he wasn't sure  er, his French  had spent so many
Mhm.
men that he, he didn't even know if it was his.
That's right.
And I had the impression that, he just adopted this child through sheer sorrow and sympathy for her  but, did not say, erm, categorically  that that was his.
No.
He calls her his board.
Erm 
That's right.
yes.
I mean, that could of been er er, an element of Victorian proprietary in there.
Yes.
Yes.
But, he, he, does make it plain to Jane that he doesn't know
No.
Yes.
if Adele is his daughter?
And this one says, quite emphatically, that is  was.
Yes.
Mm.
That's right.
Also, Helen Burns isn't an orphan  if you remember.
Oh yes!
Yes.
She's actually got a father.
Yes.
Yes.
Mm mm.
Erm
And actually, er, it doesn't, it implies that her  it's, of the Lowood , but in fact er  it improved because they had an outbreak of erm  typhus didn't they?
That's right.
Yes.
I mean 
And it er, wasn't 
th 
so bad as she grew older.
That's right.
I, I don't think I would say
eight years of misery.
No.
No
No I
It became tolerable didn't it?
Mm.
Yes.
Yes.
Yeah.
And also, it implies at, at the end that erm, Jane and Rochester meet at Thornfield Hall, and they don't, they meet Ferndean.
His other property if you remember?
Yes.
When er, when  he goes to live afterwards.
Yes.
I mean, I know it's hard  it's hard doing  erm 
Yes!
And she wasn't going to marry, she never really considered marrying Rivers did she?
It said she was on the verge of marriage.
I heard she .
She was almost 
Er 
hypnotized 
Yeah.
by him.
She was, yes.
Yeah.
You know
She was almost on the verge of just letting her will be subsumed into his wasn't she?
Yes.
Which would have meant marriage because he would have 
But not to marry 
insisted.
Well I think he would have 
Yeah.
insisted.
Er, she didn't want to, no.
Erm
Who would?
He was such a pompous pig anyway!
He was terrible wasn't he?
Yeah.
Erm, I'm sure you  know of this novel anyway, but just in case you don't, Jean Rhys  er has written Wide Sargasso Sea.
 
 
Telling the story, as she imagined it of the mad wife.
Oh!
Yes.
Before she came, before she knew Rochester.
Yes.
And her marriage with Rochester.
Sorry!
What was that book?
Wide Sargasso Sea.
Wide Sargasso Sea.
Yes.
Jean Rhys.
R H Y S .
Mm mm.
Oh!
Yes.
And if you're interested in spin-offs, from stories, I can think it's
It's a very nice book.
It is, yes.
It gives a, it gives an idea of erm  what Rochester did want.
Exactly.
It put Bertha's case.
Yes!
Doesn't it?
Mm.
Yeah.
It does.
And that one
too.
Right.
Erm
Do you mean the story in the book before when you were talking about
I don't think it's 
that 
Jean Rhys
Jean Rhys wrote 
Yeah.
a separate novel
Oh!
telling  taking a character out of Jane Eyre
The maddened wife?
the mad wife
Yeah.
and imagining what her life was like before she married him.
Erm  the novel, the second  preface  the second edition of the novel was dedicated to William Thackeray who Charlotte admired tremendously.
Mm mm.
With a  sort of  tragic turn of fate, she did not know he had a mad wife.
Erm  erm, and er, I don't know whether Thackeray  presumably he realized she didn't know.
Well in the third one she does mention er, this explanation was served directly by mistake should  been made.
Ah!
Right.
So, possibly  she's  faced that.
Yes.
Erm, the no the reception of the novel.
It was published in eighteen forty seven, in October, under the name Currer Bell.
The second edition was printed two months later, and the third, the following spring.
She achieved popular success at once.
And it was  claimed as powerful, fresh, original, vigorous and truthful.
She was amir admired by English and French critics as well as the reading public.
Although, some critics termed the novel coarse  meaning different things, some of them.
Some meant, outspoken  frank, too frank  the inappropriate placing of passion in a poor plain girl's mouth .
Now, if that wasn't what Charlotte Bronte was pleading for, I don't know what it was.
And, that the novel attacked both propriety and the upper classes quite needlessly 
Erm, there are a few interesting quotations on the reception of the novel.
One or two people who are always worth hearing if you  can bear with me.
Thackeray.
Writing to  erm, W S Williams, a friend.
I wish you hadn't sent me Jane Eyre!
It interested me so much that I've lost, or won, if you like, the whole day of reading it at the busiest period with the printers I know, waiting for copy!
 
Who the author can be, I can't guess.
If a woman, she knows her language better than most ladies do, or has had a classical education.
It is a fine book, though.
The man and woman capital, a style very generous and upright, so to speak.
I thought it was kingly for some time.
The plot of the story is one with which I am familiar.
Some of the love passages made me cry  to the astonishment of John who came in with the coals.
St John, the missionary is a failure I think  but a good failure.
There are parts, excellent.
I don't know why I tell you this, but that I have been exceedingly moved and pleased by Jane Eyre.
It is a woman's writing, but whose?
Give my respect and thanks to the author, whose novel is the first English one  and the French are only romances now, that I have been able to read for many a day .
Mm.
Erm  the next one comes from The Spectator Magazine.
Essentially, Jane Eyre, an autobiography, has some resemblance to those sculptures of the middle ages in which considerable ability, both mechanical and mental, was often displayed upon subjects that had no existence in nature.
And as far as delicacy was concerned were not pleasing in themselves.
There is indeed none of their literal impossibilities or grotesqueness.
We do not meet the faces of foxes or writers under clerical hoods, neither is there anything of physical grossness.
But with clear conceptions distinctly presented  a metaphysical consistency in the characters and their conduct, and considerable power in the execution, the whole is unnatural, and only critically interesting.
There is one fault too, in Jane Eyre, from which the artists of the middle ages were free, too much of artifice.
Their mastery of their art was too great to induce them to resort to trick to tell their story.
In the fiction edited by Currer Bell, there is rather too much of this.
Dialogues are carried on to tell the reader something he must know, or to infuse into him some explanations of a writer.
Persons act not as they would act probably in life, but enable to do the, to, but enable to author to do a bit of writing.
Everything is made to change just in the nick of time, and even the return letter office suspends its laws that Jane Eyre may carry on a tale with effect.
The fiction belongs to that school where minute anatomy of the mind predominates over incidents.
The last being made subordinate to description or the display of character.
A story which contains nothing beyond itself is a very narrow representation of human life.
Jane Eyre is this.
If we admit it to be true  but its truth is not probable in the principal incidence, and still less in the manner in which the characters influence the incidents, so as to produce conduct.
There is a low tone of behaviour, rather of morality in the book.
And what is worse than all, neither the heroine nor hero attracts sympathy.
The reader cannot see anything lovable in Mr Rochester, nor why he should be so deeply in love with Jane Eyre.
So that we have intense emotion without cause.
The book, however, displays considerable skill in the plan on great power, but rather shown in the writing than the matter, and this vigour sustains a species of interest to the last.
Although minute, and somewhat sordid, the first act of a fiction is the most truthful, especially the scenes at the philanthropic school.
There are many parts of greater energy in Jane Eyre, than, none equal to the following  and the quotation is the death of Helen Burns.
Oh yeah.
Oh!
What a jaundiced criticism!
Ooh!
Terrible!
That's The Spectator magazine.
That's the one that Jane Eyre, er not Jane Eyre, Jane Austen attacks in Northanger Abbey.
Yes.
Erm  that's the one that, wanted respectability, acceptance amongst respectable citizens, very much  and said that it would never print anything that would bring a blush to the cheek of a young
Oh!
girl.
So that's The Spectator for you.
But Rochester did er   did er, when he was trying to  rebuke himself  for committing what was bigamy, and  the works, he said, when he compared his own wife, who was really a mental animal because she very bestial the way she bit people, and then, he compared her with this sweet, dewy-eyed  Jane, he did give a reason didn't he?
He did.
Actually I don't 
You know.
think that's the best reason.
I don't think he could only 
He was very attracted to her simplicity, and goodness.
She was very good.
She was, but
Mm.
it's like that argument, that, when you look for a marriage partner you're either looking for somebody to re if you're a woman, to replicate your father, or to be 
Mm.
the total opposite of them.
That's right.
Either way, you are totally bound by what 
Mm.
your father is.
Mm.
And it seems to me that in looking for  in Rochester da Rochester's admission that he wants a woman who is opposite from Bertha
That's right.
he's still tied to his first wife.
He's got to come to learn to appreciate Jane for herself  not because she isn't what Bertha is.
Oh well, yes.
And he was he wasn't cast er, sort of er, trying to convince her, not forcibly, that erm, you know, she should bend the rules and, and be his wife.
Oh yes!
You know, in other words 
That's right.
forget all your principles and marry me because er  she is an animal.
You know 
Yes.
and you must accept the fact that she's an animal knowing that
But not 
Yeah.
realizing that that would change what she loved.
Yes.
Absolutely!
I mean 
Yeah.
a very different person.
Yeah.
Yes.
I mean 
That's right.
Jane being Jane would never, never have done it.
No.
And it's only because you said, previously  er, that she was a sort of feminist  that when, he said do this do that and she said very frankly to him  do you think just because I'm going to marry you I shall commit ?
Did you re did you see that?
Yes.
Now if you hadn't have said so Liz I wouldn't have realized that she was trying to, you know, er probe her individuality and er  women had a  a place.
I don't, I don't think a 
Mm.
I don't think the word erm  erm  tt!
Feminism?
Feminism can be applied because  if,
No.
she has kept the character and principle 
 
tha that make  that make her take those particular roles that she does.
There is one passage in which she erm  pleads for women not to be kept in such narrow confines, social confines that their matters 
Oh yes!
are not only making puddings and sewing blankets 
That's right.
and that sort of thing.
  
And when he tries to take  
When he tries to
When she wants to be an equal.
, she she 
Yes.
just wants to go there as an equal
That's right.
and he refuses point blank to accept that!
Mm.
Yes.
You know, she's got 
Mm.
to come as his wife.
He gets really  you know, into a paddy almost!
I think I can 
Yes.
almost see him sort of getting more and more annoyed just because she won't accept what he says.
Well because he's 
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
She's challenging his er
This is St John?
standards.
Yes.
Yes.
He's very authoritarian.
It does remark 
He is indeed.
quite early in the book that there was a certain coldness about his Christianity.
Mm.
And he, she said, she wasn't quite sure that it was a warmth or a  a real passion for 
Mm.
human beings, it was just a  almost clinical, I think it used the word there.
Yes.
St John's Christianity is 
Yes.
absolutely 
And a need for a power.
I mean, that's why he's presumably chosen what he wants to do, and th and the description at the end  of the way he  he led his life while he was  overseas   quite incredible !
I mean, everybody a o clearly had to jump to his tune!
Mm.
 
Yes.
You think of these
I wouldn't say very much 
 
better than the erm, what his name?
The early one who goes to erm Lowood, you know, and er
Brocklehurst.
Brocklehurst.
What's his name?
Oh!
Yes.
He was a tyrant!
Yes he was.
Yes.
They actually described erm, in term 
 
he, when Jane first sees Brocklehurst she sees him 
Mm.
she's a child of ten if you remember
Yes.
and she looked on it, he's like a black granite pillar.
Mm.
Yes.
With a sort of totem face 
Mm.
stuck on top.
Yes.
She looks all the way up at him  cos she's only 
Ominous.
.
Erm, St John, towards the end of the novel is described as erm  he, when he's asked Jane and she pleads for quarter of hour's time to think
Mhm.
about going to India with him as his wife  he goes and lays down like a, a granite pillar
Yes.
she said, on the grass.
Yes.
And I think they're, they're linked  by imagery, Brocklehurst and St John.
What I couldn't understand was that 
I was fascinated 
that when
Sorry!
when she said er  erm, you know, he said you're not fit for love!
But then he, he insisted that she was gonna be his wife, which obviously, it was like a pent up frustration in him.
But she was 
 
pretty  he, he wanted a 
Yes, but I, I got the impression he wanted her body!
 
And, and that's the only reason why he wanted her there, that's the only reason why he could not accept her as a friend or an, as a companion.
And as a  
 
a man when she meets him.
Yes.
But, thought he was a nasty thing 
 
We'll confuse
One at a time!
 

I think quite a lot of it, erm, books haven't mentioned this er frustrated erm feeling in the grant is that she's come out 
Mm.
er er, erm  that's true enough.
Yes.
And I think the girls definitely saw, much that they loved Patrick, they definitely, their Branwell I mean
Oh!
erm, they saw him being  indulged in a way they were not.
Mm.
If they'd been brought up all, all girls  maybe their fiction would have been different.
Erm, I was talking more about frustrated sexual erm  er  feelings that er, they weren't allowed to  you know, let go and  in their way of life.
No!
I don't think there was any way in which, to let go.
That, er 
At all.
no.
Except in these fantasies in which they let
Yes.
all, they, they 
Mm.
all sorts of feelings.
Mm mm.
And their, their erm  Angria and Gondal, these erm 
Mm.
countries, they invented.
Well some of them are  then aren't they really.
I thought that St John
was madly in love with the other girl.
Yes he was.
The problem was 
Yes.
Yes.
He was, yes.
I thought, if he had any passion it was directed to her, not  I don't think he had it  and Jane.
He, he 
I think it was a 
He got fifteen minutes in the  of acting.
I think it was a power struggle.
I think Jane, nobody, he'd not had a woman stand up to him like that before
Mm!
and he wanted to own it.
Yes.
Mm.
That's the only way to quell it isn't it?
Is to own it.
The master.
Yeah.
The master.
In any case, it was all so impersonal.
Wi he, he needed a helpmate
Yes.
and, cos she, if she wasn't going to marry him cos he was far too vain  he couldn't have her.
Mm.
And she was reasonably bright, she could take his ideas and, and  be a reasonable companion to him, er er, in his, in his  partner  duty.
So she'd, she'd do.
She can come.
Mm.
She, she was co she coming!
You know.
But was she playing?
Yes.
No.
I don't think she was.
She, she'd been told by the Reeds that 
Yes.
she was threatened 
Mm mm.
Well 
and so she always thought she was threatened.
Didn't er, Rochester
But Rochester didn't, er  didn't think she was playing.
He thought, she had a, a gentleness and a grace.
Yes.
But 
Mm.
there is a difference, a difference 
though I expect it  
that 
Yes.
and prettiness.
Yes.
But 
Mm.
what is prettiness?
Mm.
Yeah.
It's in the eye of the beholder.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I was gonna say that.
Would you like to hear George Eliot's brief comment?
Ooh yes!
In a letter to chap called Charles Bray.
I have read Jane Eyre, mon ami, and shall be glad to know what you admire in it?
All self sacrifice is good, but one could like it to be in a somewhat nobler cause than that of a diabolical law which chains a man body and soul to a putrefying carcass .
Of which I think she means Bertha.
Mm.
Mm.
However, the book is interesting.
Only, I wish the characters would talk a little less like the heros and heroines of police reports .
Oh that's quite  
 
 
Before we go onto  that, erm  how far do you think Jane Eyre supported this idea?
I mean, she sort of flew the kite as it were with  you know, if the wife was erm  presumably the husband in other cases  was mad beyond belief it was a good reason for  casting her off.
How far do you think she went along with it?
I mean, she could have been er  in love with Rochester but  it looks to me like a beginning of an idea, you know, that er  there are circumstances in which she er 
In which divorce would be possible?
Yes.
Erm
Do you think she supported it?
Or do you think she just  put it there for the argument?
I think she 
To go with the character.
erm
 

I mean Bertha represents  erm  the dark side, if you like, of Rochester's life.
You have a contrast between Rochester and St John Rivers  don't you?
As the two 
Mm.
men who proposed to Jane.
And you have Rochester who has  erm  he's not exactly been a degenerate  and he has shown some restraint, he has cared for this wife, he's brought her home.
And he's cared for this  offspring.
Mm.
Which may or may not 
Yes.
be his offspring.
And at the end he shows enormous  courage
Mm mm.
when he tries to rescue her from the fire.
But  Bertha, if you like, represents the erm  the unfettered side of Rochester's  lust  passion, if you like.
Er, whereas St John is as  tightly controlled as a  as a strong elastic band isn't he?
Mm mm.
Everything is held in like this with St John.
With Rochester it's been let go.
Mm.
Mhm.
Erm  I mean, I've  personally, I think the novel is actually a journey.
Erm  I think that Jane's  erm  journey towards independence  is  erm  where she  moving towards a position where, if you achieve a certain kind of independence, you can then choose to give it up.
Mm.
And that's what she does.
Mm mm.
It's not worth giving it up if you haven't chosen to give it up.
Mm.
Mhm.
It's a bit like being erm  you know, you know, a Christian isn't it?
Free born.
It's only  worth it  if it's personal, if you choose it.
It isn't worth it if it was foisted on you, or you inherited  it's got to be a personal thing.
Erm  so I think Jane's is a  erm  a spiritual journey  with a psychological  basis.
That link between childhood and adulthood  that she shows  that childhood terrors  can affect  adult biases, opinions.
Now, in this introduction of this
Oh yes.
this is an old er  er Penguin.
Yes.
It, it says, almost what you're saying.
Oh does it?
Yes.
Oh!
That's nice to know.
Erm
yes.
It says erm   The theme is an urgently felt personal one, an exploration of how a woman comes to maturity in the world of the writer's youth .
Er, erm, it goes on to explain, but I don't want to
bother you.
But, er similar  similar 
Oh!
That's  thank you.
It's always nice to know 
 
people agree with you isn't it?
 
I once  
Oh yes.
for her
Mm?
Mrs  
 
you know, the er wife of the famous er  literary critic.
Queenie Leavis.
Oh yes!
Que Queenie Leavis.
Yes.
Queenie Leavis.
She wrote the foreword.
Oh did she?
Yes.
Yes.
Ah well.
Yeah.
Mm.
Well there you are!
Two minds, great minds.
Yes, that's right.
 
If you, if you look at all the men in the this book, I mean, to begin with the erm  cousin, the boy  when she 
Horrible!
was a child 
Mm.
John Rivers.
was a horrible thing 
Yes.
in this story.
Yes.
And the girl.
And then the erm  previous  you know, the erm  he, he was a revolting character  and, Rochester, of course, she didn't stay friends with.
Mm mm.
Erm, and then, and then you get erm, Rivers, who's also a horrible character, although in a different way.
Erm, they  you wouldn't, you know, you'd imagine she didn't have a very opinion of  the  male sex altogether wouldn't you ?
Yes.
You would.
Erm  and you'd thi I mean,it's also true that she didn't know many.
No.
Yeah.
That's true.
I mean, she knew, her brother 
isn't it?
Mm mm.
her father
Mm mm.
Mm.
and erm  I mean there was th the curate who that she eventually married  but, really they wouldn't know, they wouldn't have any male friends.
But she made up her mind, didn't she, that  she had to publish this book under a man's name?
Mm.
So she must have been really, had really deep feelings about what was going on in society  and why she should do that.
Yes.
You know, I mean, er, that is why it's all coming out in the books, that's why the, all these men, she's sort of saying I'll get my own back now, you know!
 
I can have anything I want  amongst 
Yes.
these vicious, nasty brutes   not, yeah because 
That they  
she realized how she was living.
Mm.
If they're brought up, I mean,th the child at the beginning is more sinned against than sinning, it's not his fault he's a pain in the backside, it's his brother!
Oh yes!
It's him!
He's the one er  a pa re well or a as you say, Branwell was the same, brought up, he was spoiled rotten!
Yeah.
Yeah.
And how can you expect to turn out reasonable?
Mm.
Mm.
So,sa her comment probably is  erm  on the upbringing rather than anything else.
Yeah.
I mean, she doesn't mention this specifically, but, I mean,
But Mrs Kissett 
Though there's a certain amount of indulgence with boys.
Yes.
You know.
Yes.
Oh!
In, then there was.
Probably knocked the top off the tree.
Oh!
He's a boy, type 
Yes.
of thing, you know.
Make them feel that they're treated as different.
So I can see, you know,
 
Yeah.
You know.
It's interesting that he dies, as well Branwell.
Yes.
In the end.
There are 
So 
so in the end she got her come-uppance.
They all get 
Well 
their come-uppance !
they do in spite
Er, Mrs Grant er, absolutely spoilt her own girls  which she knows  you know 
Mrs Reed.
Mrs Reed 
Mrs Reed 
Yes.
didn't she?
She did, yes.
Yes.
Oh well.
Yeah.
And, whereas, her father he, he didn't think of much of the girls at all did he?
Ca and it was all for the son.
Erm, I think he became very proud of Charlotte.
Mm.
Erm, but I think he tended to leave the bringing up of the girls to his sister-in-law.
Oh!
Eileen.
Er, and  I mean, as was conventional in those days, you educate, your sons went to school  and you try and, educated your girls at home, but the, the aunt put her foot down and said she wouldn't do it.
Oh!
Aunt Branwell.
So that's why the girls went to Cowan Bridge.
Erm
but, yes, I mean, he was launched into several different careers by his father with money he could ill spare.
Course!
Mm.
Really.
Mm.
But erm  that didn't, no, that wasn't on offer for the girls.
It wasn't available.
Well that came up in Anne  in Anne Bronte's book as well didn't he?
Yes.
You know 
Oh yes!
the position of women, I mean, they  they were obviously all kicking against it, and 
They were, yes.
  
Helen Huntingdon's statement
Yes!
to Gilbert Markenham, his mother
Mm.
Yes, that happened.
that you would have boys go out with no forewarning, tripping over  stumbling blocks here, there and everywhere and girls who are not even allowed to benefit  from others' experience, let alone, have their own.
That's right.
Mm mm.
Mm.
Erm    having said that I think the novel is al is a spiritual journey  erm  not only Jane's, I should say, but also Rocheter Rochester's.
Erm, and I think it's also a journey towards independence, and a journey fro towards belonging, if you like  from being an outcast  to belonging.
Mm.
Oh yes!
Er, she is  unwanted, because she's different, because she's alien  as a child, isn't she?
In the Reed's household.
She says, as an adult, looking back, I know why they didn't want me.
Mm.
I was so different.
And why they didn't like me.
Erm  and that's, of course, why she's so delighted when she finds  that the Rivers are her relations.
Mhm.
Mm.
Er, and can share her, er, legacy with them.
Erm  and then, of course, in the end  she belongs entirely to Rochester.
And that's a free  gift isn't it?
No, that's got horrible commercial overtones!
I don't mean that.
I mean, it's a, a gift freely given.
He, he's brought her free choice.
Yes.
It seems to me that she's also saying, it's also a plea, on Charlotte Bronte's behalf to men, to want women who come to them  developed, independent  and 
Mm.
choose to give it up, as must the man, in 
Mm.
marriage.
Don't you, almost, you can almost hear behind the text saying, wouldn't you rather have a woman like that
Mm.
than a woman who's always been either under her father's thumb, or brother's thumb, and then gets passed to yours?
Mm mm.
Wouldn't you rather have a woman with a mind of her own?
Yes.
Er, oh yes!
Can't say no to this .
Depends on the men.
I don't think in those days they wanted women with minds of their own, did they?
Well, er St John certainly didn't!
I would.
I would.
No.
Oh.
Right.
Erm  speaking 
Rochester realizes her worth  doesn't he?
He does, yes.
Mm.
Very much so.
He does.
Yes.
Erm  and they are both
passionate  people.
Mm.
And he was very changed.
Yes.
He was.
He changed.
He almost bu became very humble and grateful, of course.
Cos she looked after him so 
Yes.
but he was very arrogant in the beginning.
Erm, let's look at a few quotations.
Er, I don't suppose anybody's got the copy I've got  which is from a jumble sale.
 
Erm, the Zodiac Press.
I've never heard of it before, but
No?
No, right.
So we are the end of chapter six.
I've just got that, chapter six.
The end, the end.
Paragraph beginning, Helena speaking  She has been, been unkind to you.
Right at the end, last page.
Yes?
Are we all there?
Jane has just told  Helen Burns her story.
And I think she's just been erm  has she been humiliated by him yet?
No.
Perhaps she hasn't.
Erm,Well, I asked impatiently, is not Mrs Reed a hard-hearted bad woman ?
And Helen replies,she has been unkind to you, no doubt because, you see, she dislikes your cast of character as Miss Scatcherd does mine.
But, how minutely, you remember all she has done and said to you.
What a singularly deep impression her injustice seems to have made on your heart.
No ill-usage so brands its record on my feelings.
Would you not be happier if you tried to forget her severity, together with the passionate emotions if excited?
Life appears to me too short to be spent in nursing animosity or registering wrongs.
We are, and must be, one and all, burdened with faults in this world.
But the time will soon come when I trust we shall put them off in putting off our corruptible bodies, when debasement and sin will fall from us with this cumbrous frame of flesh and only the spark of the spirit will remain.
The impalpable principle of life and thought, pure as when it left the creator to inspire the creature.
Whence it came it will return, perhaps again, to be communicated to some being higher than man, perhaps to pass through gradations of glory from the pale human soul to brighten the seraph.
Surely, it will never, on the contrary be suffered to je to degenerate from man to fiend?
No, I cannot believe that.
I hold another creed, which no one ever taught me  and which I seldom mention, but in which I delight and to which I cling, for it extends hope to all, it makes eternity a rest  a mighty home, not a terror and an abyss.
Besides, with this creed I can so clearly distinguish between the criminal and his crime, I can so sincerely forgive the first, while I abhor the last  with this creed revenge never worries my heart, degradation never too deeply disgusts me, injustice never crushes me too low, I live in calm looking to the end .
Now, we've seen Jane as a passionate, spirited  outspoken little girl haven't we?
Quite justifiably  I 
Mm.
think.
She really has been treated badly at the Reeds.
And we're beginning to see her  a co coming under Helen's influence.
Mm mm.
Being tempered by Helen.
I think the first evidence we have of that, is when  Brocklehurst has placed her on the stool and publicly humiliated her.
And this Miss Temple asks her in her  well in her own study, to tell her story.
And bearing in mind, Helen's advice  she doesn't  er, express all the resentment she once felt or se or the  er, let her speech run away with her.
Mm.
And she is wholly believed because of that.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
In my book, the notes, er from out of this  I have another  a er  ano I have  creed, it's got Charlotte Bronte's own belief.
Mm.
Yes.
And Anne's too, I think.
If you remember this, er, the death of erm  Huntingdon?
Mm mm.
When the tenant of Wildfowl Hall 
Mm.
Mm.
But at er, Helen  er  fervently believed that his spirit would saved.
That the creator would not, what was the, the saying?
Dispense with anything he hath made.
But erm  and, Charlotte believed it too, yes!
Mm
Yes?
Seem to be, in all these novels though, runs outs, a lot on lists of er, middle .
There's always this sermonizing isn't there?
You know, that it helping to sort of make the reader  er, the thing about .
Well, Christian virtues and duty were very closely erm 
That's right.
er, related in, in Victorian society, you know.
Yes.
It's  some aspired to them, and some hypocro hypocritically sat  behind them.
Like Brocklehurst  coming in and  and penny-pinching about what the girls should have and then his wife and daughters come in dressed in velvets and furs and so on.
Oh yes.
And retribution very often comes, I think, in the books  in this life  as well, they, I mean, again in Middlemarch, I think you get your deserts don't you, and er
You do.
Yes.
I mean, Helen Burn's plea here is  not to be  to eager for retribution to come in this life, but trust to it  erm
In the next .
well, not to come in the next,but rather  to  you know, sort of leave it to a higher justice if you like.
Cos she separated sin from the sinner in 
Yes.
Exactly!
Yes.
Which she has to learn to do  in 
Mm.
the case of Rochester isn't it?
She has to learn to 
 
separate his crime of attempted bigamy  from his love for her.
Which she does.
 
Mm mm.
Helen, of course, is based on  depiction of Helen, on Maria  Bronte.
Oh!
The eldest girl who died when she was twelve.
Mm.
And who was a little mother
Mm.
to the whole brood.
And they all where  heartbroken
Mm.
you know, when she died.
Must have been absolutely shattering wouldn't it?
Erm  right  now, can  following loosely this idea of spiritual development  if you go to the end of chapter twenty four
That goes into volume two does it?
Er, I haven't got them divided into 
Oh, mine are in volumes.
volumes in mine I'm afraid.
Oh!
Well this isn't
Two hundred.
It's two hundred.
Have you got the same copy?
Well mine's er, I've got three and then six.
 
Yeah, have a look by all means, yes.
This is the   
There's plenty there.
Down there.
Three O two, in wo one of them, the twenty fourth.
 
Three O two.
Yes.
Pardon?
Oh!
Ta.
Right.
The last, paragraph of the chapter, twenty four.
This is a  first period of courtship  if you like.
Erm  when  ah,Jane in a sense is having to keep his passion at bay, his impatience  er, for their wedding at bay, by teasing him.
Yet, after all, my task was not an easy one  often I would rather have pleased than teased him.
My future husband was becoming to me my whole world, and more than the world, almost my hope of heaven.
He stood between me and every thought of religion as an eclipse intervenes between man and the broad sun.
I could not in those days, see God for his creature, of whom I had made an idol .
Oh no!
Danger  isn't it?
Mm.
Those are the warning signs.
It's too much.
It's too much.
It can't, even had they married at this stage  it would not have been right.
Even had he been unmarried.
Because Jane did not look on him  as a, as a man but as an idol.
Mm.
She didn't know him well enough.
Er, and I think that's an interesting point  that, where yo where, when you read the story and you think  really what prevented them marrying  happily then, was Bertha  but it wasn't  it was their attitudes to each other.
Mm.
Shall we break for a drink now?
And 
Mm.
erm
Mm!
meet again at five to?
Mm!
Yes?
for the sake of recording?
We are
Erm  we have  St John's proposal to her.
Shall I read it very briefly it takes er time to  to find it doesn't it?
Er    she    but, as brother and sister  erm    Simplify your complicated interest , St John says to her,feelings, thoughts, wishes, aims, merge all considerations in one purpose  that of fulfilling with effect, with power, the mission of your great master.
To do so, you must have a coadjutor, not a brother, that is a loose tie, but a husband.
I too, do not want a sister, a sister might any day be taken from me.
I want a wife, the sole helpmeet I can influence efficiently in life and retain absolutely till death .
Well she describes that as like an iron shroud.
 
Turning .
And then a few pages on  when she says, erm  we must abandon the scheme of marriage.
No!
It, said he, it is a long-cherished scheme and the only one which can secure my great end .
My great end?
  
But I shall urge you no further at present tomorrow I leave for Cambridge.
I have many friends to whom I should wish to say farewell.
I shall be absent a fortnight.
Take that space of time to consider my offer, and do not forget that if you reject it, it is not me you deny, but God.
  
Through my meanings, he opens to you a noble career, as my wife only can you enter upon it.
Refuse to be my wife and you limit yourself forever to a track of selfish ease and barren obscurity .
If that isn't
Erm
erm
arrogance there.
yes, religious arrogance, I don't know what is.
I mean  he says he's  he knows that he is  erm  poor material, that he's inadequate, inadequacies will be made up by God.
Oh!
But, if you reject it, but it's not me you deny, but God.
His ego is enormous!
Mm.
Erm
Beyond the truth.
Yes.
and  it certainly makes you feel more favourably towards Rochester  doesn't it ?
 
Yes I think so, yes.
Erm, but that is, in a sense, part of Jane's  spiritual education isn't it?
Mm.
She has to learn to distinguish betwe sh to, to recognize the falseness of that statement.
Mm.
Mm.
To sort God from St John Rivers  if you like.
And she does.
Mm.
Mm mm mm.
Well she wants to be his curate, er, she does use the curate.
She does, yes.
Yes.
And, erm
Yes!
oh, I mean er, I know we can have different opinions on why we think St John is so adamant that she must be his wife  I do think it's a power struggle.
I don't think he's come across any
Mm.
so independently minded, as Jane.
And he can't erm  he can't quite live with that.
He certainly isn't going to live with it independent.
He's going to have it under his thumb.
It did rather stretch 
But erm 
my credulity  when she wandered over the Moors and she was at death's door, and she  turned up at her cousins'
Well
hou house .
Yes.
I mean it 
 
 
Is that, erm  is, I mean we, we can look at that two ways, I mean 
 
is that divine intervention?
Mm.
Erm, coincidence?
Or, as you say, beyond the bounds?
Yes.
But still it's all part of the .
Well the psycho 
Well the, the plot.
the psychopathic communication at the end when they come together 
Yes.
again, I mean that  is stretching the bounds the belief a bit far.
Well that is er
I mean,cle clearly
Yes, the voice of  
Yes.
Mm.
Mind you, it,
Yes it did.
Erm  it, it, you know,th if she cle Charlotte Bronte clearly believes in divine intervention doesn't she?
And in, in the context of what sh of what she was writing
Mm.
and when she was writing.
Yeah, I think it's fair enough.
I mean, it stretches our belief  cos 
Yes.
we don't believe that you can 
Yes.
hear voices up above.
Is this the creed?
I don't know.
I   but I believe in telepathy.
But of course, I, is that what 
Yes I believe in telepathy, but I don't believe in  in G and I shall come 
Yeah.
to you and
Yes.
he heard the voice say 
You can't, no 
Oh no, not that both listened in at the time.
Dorothy?
Although, I do think that probably erm, religion at that time  er, could have been this very narrow, rigid 
Mm.
kind of erm, idea.
I mean, the church preached, probably  erm  this kind of religion, or some of the churches 
Mm mm.
did.
Mm.
You know, this sort puritan, I suppose erm  you know, following the puritan tradition.
Yes.
But, they were very narrow, very rigid
Yes.
and erm
That's right.
cos you might say, that it was all for the  sort of, poor old pe people  down.
Ooh, you could certainly say that, yes.
Mm.
Erm 
But in the middle of this we've still got a fairly young woman with vivid imagination.
Mm.
Yes.
We have.
Yes.
Yes.
Yeah.
And strong feeling.
Yeah.
Yes!
Yeah.
Mm.
Yes.
Erm, in a sense you have, it, it's, it's erm a  a spiral construction isn't it?
A sort of, a triangular if you like  you start off with one position, represented by Rochester, which is, too much passion, uncontrollable passion 
Mm.
almost.
I mean,a apart from Bertha, I know he was tricked into it by his father and brother, that marriage, but he 
Yes.
surely wouldn't have gone through it if Bertha hadn't appealed to him.
No.
No.
Erm, if he hadn't wanted her, at least, at first .
Well Jean Rhys  says that she's a beauty.
Yes.
Absolutely!
Yes.
But she also had a big dowry.
Yes.
Well that was the 
 
the father and brother who saw 
Yes.
that didn't they?
Yeah.
Erm
There was  
and then he has erm, erm  Madame Varens, doesn't he?
Adele's 
Oh yes.
mother.
Yes.
Yes.
And, or Mademoiselle.
Yes, that's right.
And then Clara, and er, somebody's else's name I 
Oh yes.
can't remember.
Yes.
Yeah.
Erm  and  then we come, as it were, to the second position which is St John Rivers
Mm.
who actually does fall in love who would have him
Oh!
and suppresses  er Rosamond Oliver, suppresses that totally in his nature.
Erm, for his religious mission.
Mm!
And then you come to Rochester at the end  erm  oh well, I mean, without finding quotations  erm  he is the synthesis isn't it?
He is the meeting of the two points.
He 
Mm 
is erm  you know, the, the  the one erring lamb, if you like, that comes back.
And erm  I mean, accepts Jane, and thanks God and  determines to be better.
You know, he reforms doesn't he?
Mm.
But without any of the religious priggishness
Mm.
that we've seen from St John Rivers.
Did he turn to Jane Eyre erm  after he'd been rejected by  erm  the other woman, the Oliver woman?
No.
No!
No, he'd ha she'd had it  ?
Yes.
I, I mean, I think he  he shows her no encouragement 
Cos she went off with another chap
Instead of.
Yeah.
instead of.
He, he then thought right,whe who can I look for now type of thing?
Wha what happened first?
Do you see what I mean?
I think they drifted apart, Rosamond and St John 
They did.
or at least 
She did.
But she was eminently unsuitable wasn't she?
That was the ploy that 
Yes!
she was completely unsuitable for the like he was determined 
 
to meet.
Yes.
They couldn't marry,e even though he loved her.
Yes, er
Too much conflict and
She would have a miserable life, of course.
Mm.
Oh yes!
She really would.
Well any wife of his would have had a miserable life!
 
I have no time for St John Rivers at all!
No.
 
Erm 
And he was such a hypocrite wasn't he?
He was
Yes.
He was a hypocrite.
hypocrite.
He, one of these people who  allies their own opinions and feelings with the higher authority that they  erm
with God.
Exactly!
It's, it's that er in Jane Austen's 
That they were recognized.
er  er, which one is
Collins.
Collins.
Collins.
Oh yes!
In his, yeah, the thing 
Oh yes!
That's right.
Yeah, he he is .
Yes.
He is indeed.
They, they must have existed these characters 
Oh yes!
that, you know, clergy mustn't 
Yes!
they?
Yes.
Lu Lutheran agrees hypocrisy that kind of religion.
There is a such  
 
Yes.
It's impossible to carry out.
I knew one once.
Yes.
You did?
 

Oh!
I sympathize!
Yes.
Yes.
But, on the other hand I wonder how any of them were really, I mean er  our own Minister at our own church, he is extremely intellectual and very theological, and a wonderful man of compassion.
These men were just given livelihoods weren't they?
Yes.
Mm.
To, trot up all these awful ones.
They weren't very 
That's right, yes.
which I don't think they were truly good, it was quite a good, reasonable living wi with a house thrown in.
But it wasn't a calling.
No.
No.
No.
It wasn't a vocation.
Not at all!
But they thought 
Not a vocation.
it was didn't they?
They pretend it was 
 
but i didn't you send your
Oh yes.
wasn't it the third of fourth son
Third.
who went into the 
Went into church.
church?
Yes.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Was it, the first to the army
Army, the law 
Yes.
or 
The law, that's it.
  
So it was only third choice was it?
Arithmetic.
I'm informed it's usually the fourth.
I don't, I don't know if it's
It's the third or fourth.
Oh yes!
In Charlotte    .
.
But the, the  a child a year  
eighteen children 
Yes. 
Oh right.
Erm
Let's come to  the Gothic in Jane Eyre, in why, in a sense,i it's in our reading lis it's on our reading list this term.
Mhm mm.
Let me read you a couple of paragraphs from  er, an essay on the new Gothic in Jane Eyre , by erm, and American critic called Robert Harman.
Some years ago Edmund Wilson complained of writers of Gothic who could  fail to lay hold on the terrors that lie deep in the human soul and have caused man to fear himself.
Unquote.
And proposed an anthology of horror stories that probe psychological cabins and find disquieting obsessions.
This is precisely the direction in which Charlotte Bronte moved.
This was one aspect of her following human emotions where they took her, into many depths and intensities, that has yet hardly had a place in a novel.
this was the finest achievement of Gothic.
Gothic is variously defined.
In a recent book review, Lesley Fiedler implies that Gothic is shoddy mystery mongering.
Whereas, F Cudworth-Flint defines the Gothic tradition, which he considers nearly central in American literature, as a literary exploration of the avenues to death.
For Montagu Summers, on the other hand, Gothic was the essence of romanticism, and romanticism was the literary expression of supernaturalism.
Both these latter definitions, though they are impractically inclusive, have suggested value.
For originally, Gothic was one of the number of aesthetic developments which serve to breach the classical and rational order of life, and to make possible a kind of response, and a response to a kind of thing that among the knowing had long been taboo.
In the novel it was the function of Gothic to open horizons beyond social patterns, rational decisions, and institutionally approved emotions.
In a word, to enlarge the sense of reality and its impact on the human being.
It became, then, a great liberator of feeling, but acknowledged the non-rational  in the world of things and events, occasionally in the realm of the transcendental, ultimately, and most persistently in the depths of the human being.
The first Gothic writers took the easy way.
The excitement of mysterious scene and happening, which I call old Gothic.
Of this, Charlotte Bronte made some direct use, while at the same time tending towards humorous modifications, which are anti-Gothic.
But what really counts is this indirect usefulness to her, it released her from the patterns of the novel of society and therefore, permitted the flowering of her real talent, a talent for finding and giving dramatic form to impulses and feelings which because of their depth, or mysteriousness, or intensity, or ambiguity, or of their ignoring or transcending every day norms of propriety or reason, increase wonderfully the sense of reality in a novel.
To note the emergence of this new Gothic in Charlotte Bronte, is not, I think, to pursue an old mode into dusty corners, but rather to identify historically the distinguishing, and the distinguished element in her work .
Now    let's look at the heroine  in Jane Eyre.
And think of, er in the light of the heroines we've already discussed.
Erm  she is struggling out of dependence on others into  independence isn't she?
Which she then freely surrenders for love.
She's spirited, restless, blunt, imaginative, clear sighted, principled and passionate.
So that's my list of adjectives, you can certainly add more if you want to.
And with a keen sense of injustice.
Actually, that, childish keen sense of injustice I couldn't find  anywhere else as strongly depicted, except in Great Expectations.
Do you know, when the young Pip
Mm.
as a boy
Mm.
and his  sister  married to Joe Gardurey, is bringing him up  and she resents him.
Mhm.
Mm.
And she  at bed time she gets hold of him by the scruff of the neck and 
Mm.
bangs him upstairs so that his boots  bang against the stairs at every step, he hasn't time to put his feet down!
And he says, it wasn't my fault!
Mm.
I was born, and it was not my fault I was there.
Don't you get the feeling of Oliver Twist?
Yes.
I think so  to some extent.
Mm mm.
Mm mm.
It's, perhaps it's too long since I read Oliver Twist for me to remember it as clearly.
But that's the, that's the idea that came to my mind anyway.
Pip in Great Expectations.
 
Which is, I mean it, just  you know, as literary connections these things do pop up  in your mind.
Erm  I think of the heroines that we've studied, Emily  also perhaps we could include Matilda from Attranto  erm, Maude from Uncle Silas  Helen Huntingdon from Wildfowl Hall, and Helena, I would say, not Rosa Budd, she's not in this tradition
Mhm mm.
but Helena, from, the Mystery of Edwin Drood I think Jane is most like Helen Huntingdon.
Mm.
Hardly surprising when you think
Mm.
they were sisters .
Mm.
Er, the writers were sisters.
Erm, although I think Helena   Landless could have been in this tradition don't you?
She was certainly spirited enough.
Aha.
Mm.
Erm  I mean, it's a new position though isn't it?
Struggling out of dependence in order to freely give up your independence.
We haven't come across that before have we?
No.
In a romance, Gothic romance.
Well no.
But we know much more about erm  Jane Eyre, than we do about Helena 
Mm.
 Landless 
Yes.
Oh yes!
She is only .
 
In fact, this is the problem 
She is only
Mm.
discussing all characters from 
Yes.
Edwin Drood isn't it?
Yes.
Yes.
That they, we don't 
That's right.
know where they were going to go.
That's right.
Jane Eyre is a complete character isn't she?
Mm.
Yes.
And on both sides you have this sort of modesty and
And she developed 
drawing our heroine.
Yeah, she grows doesn't she?
Mm, yes.
Mm.
But even Helen Huntingdon  doesn't seek independence in order to freely give it up again.
No.
No.
No, she doesn't.
She erm  if, in a sense she's already fixed onto the next generation hasn't she?
She wants to save Arthur her son.
Mm mm.
She wouldn't have sought her independence at all if it hadn't been at such.
Mm.
She wouldn't have wanted it.
Oh well, she 
That's right.
may have wanted it but she wouldn't have done it.
No.
I don't think she would.
But erm 
Well why not?
Jane Eyre didn't really look upon erm, erm  herself as giving up her independence er by  marrying Rochester did she?
No.
And it was erm  formed within herself really.
Yes.
Yes.
The other way around really isn't 
Mm.
it?
I mean
Yes.
he was going to be dependant upon her, so she was taking on
Oh!
That's it, yes.
she wasn't er 
Oh!
I think that, I think she does make 
Possibly, yeah.
it really clear though to him, when he says, in fact, I, their dialogue took away  
I'll be your eyes and all 
Yes.
that.
Yes.
Erm
Yes,
she does make it clear to him that she is not 
Mm.
simply going to be his nurse
Nurse.
No.
and and his wife in that sense.
 
She needs him
Mm.
as much as he needs her.
But, after it all, she's gonna be the one that's going to need the erm  the strength.
Mm.
Yes.
It is her, erm  moral strength, if you like 
Mm.
yes.
And, er because she's  
I can't think what she's giving up?
Mm.
No, it's just fulfilment isn't it?
Mm.
It is, yes.
But that's what I mean by freely giving up.
You are giving up your independence.
 
I mean, she's, she's got a competence that 
Yes, but what was her independence if she didn't marry him?
Well she could have been 
I mean where was, what would she have done?
I mean she could have probably had  
 
which would have meant  
She didn't need to do anything she didn't want to!
No,sh she had five thousand.
 
Yes I know 
She had a lot of money!
but, what was she going to?
She was a still a single woman.
But she wanted to actually  
She was.
In those times single women really didn't have much.
She wanted to own her own shop.
No, but I
Oh right.
thi I certainly think 
Okay.
she and Diana, and Mary could have lived quite happily 
Yes.
Yes.
Mm.
Mm.
Erm, and I, I think it's important that she's left this legacy
Mm.
to show that she does give up 
Well, yes.
Oh yes.
material
Mm.
independence.
Mm.
They both had  husbands 
Quite willingly.
didn't they?
So no doubt 
Yes.
Yes.
so really I, she couldn't probably ever live on her own.
 
Yes.
necessary.
I would say that she is the strongest  woman  er  heroine that we've read.
When you think of Maude 
That's right.
Oh yes!
er, Uncle Silas
Mm.
er, the compliant women, Matilda and the
Oh!
Matilda was dreadful!
You know, but  this is the 
Yes.
first one who's stood up on her own  
There's He Helen Huntingdon.
Absolutely!
She did it too well didn't she?
As much as that?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Erm  no 
No.
I think Jane Eyre's stronger, but Helen 
Yes.
Yes.
Huntingdon did  stand up, and go against
Yes.
erm, all the 
 
the law and the er religious  er  instruction of the time didn't she?
Yes, she did.
I mean, didn't erm  oh I can't remember his name.
That humbug of a  of a  curate  not, not curate, er, vicar.
Oh yes.
In Wildfowl Hall who told her that really she ought not to have left her husband
Yes.
That's right.
erm, unless he had bodily harmed her
Oh yes!
and that should be no minor thing.
Mm mm.
 
I think she was very, very good like that depicting 
Yes.
properties .
Women out if anything, we se the first book we read was  back in seventeen hundred
That's right.
Yeah.
Go on.
and it's a everybody was shown then
Yes.
the independence of women are getting more independent each  by the century, decade, you know.
Yes.
And of course she was educated 
 
wasn't she?
And she had erm
She had a good 
She had had a 
education.
she had as well, yeah.
Well it's  
which meant that she was more liberal  minded.
Yes.
With her particular character it made her more liberal- minded
Mm.
And maybe she  
than the other ones, the elder ones.
Yes.
Yes, it did, yes.
I mean 
I i 
Because  it can't be so unusual  for girls to be education in a se I mean, I just don't know anything this i it's a blank in my mind.
But, if there was schools, like Lowood
Mm mm.
with good people at the head of them like Miss Temple, erm, then,th th it wouldn't be on its own.
They must, er, especially if it was up
Well they you had 
in the far North out in the
Yes.
sticks, erm, there must have been quite a few schools for girls 
Mm.
around.
But there wasn't much 
They must have been pious.
for them do with it except to become governesses 
That's what they're chosen for
was there?
No.
 
Yes, but the, the presentation itself I was thinking about 
Mm mm mm.
I mean the 
Mm.
the, the idea of educating girls must have been allowed.
You had to be able to pay.
Pardon?
You had to be able pay.
Yes.
weren't they?
I mean, most of them .
Any,couldn't make any progress.
I'd be getting .
Yes quite!
Yes, she was a very strong character, Esther 
Yeah.
Williams 
 
she saw five husbands off didn't she?
Yes.
Oh yes.
Erm, yes I mean, as I understand it, girls were expected to be educated at home by their mother
Yes.
who would have been educated at home by her mother.
And, if those circumstances were not  er, pertained, then the girls could be sent away to school.
Mm.
Erm, but I think  we've got, we've got erm  Cowan Bridge in the early part of Lowood and I think we've got really Roe Head School  at the end Lowood, as it were.
Charlotte's second school
Mm mm.
when she went back as a teacher.
Mm mm.
When she was much more enlightened er, and the where the learning standard  er,simp was much better simply because the girls were cared for.
Mm.
If you're, if you're  if you're cold and hungry you're not learning are you?
No.
I mean, she started 
Mm, I know.
with the village children didn't she?
Or, he did  as the
Ye 
whe whe well who 
Well Jane, I mean, er Jane did that  
Oh yes!
In er Morton?
Yes.
Right.
Yes.
That's right, yes.
Er, so I mean that was 
 
unusual.
Yes.
Yes it was.
Yes, for the farmers' daughters and 
And it was for girls, for girls 
Yes.
there was already one in existence belonging to
There was a class thing there as well, I noticed
Mhm mm.
it didn't like them at first, because she felt that they were very rough and uncouth.
Mm.
That's right.
But as she got to know them
Yes.
she, she began to like them.
Oh yes.
Yes.
Mm.
Yeah, so it, it 
Yeah.
showed people kept in their classes didn't 
Yes.
they?
That's right.
They did.
Yes.
I remember there was one  
But she learnt, she was open to it wasn't 
Yes.
she?
Yes 
Mm.
Yes.
She was opened to having her mind changed.
Very commendable for 
Yes.
And of course, there was another bit 
Aha.
which I thought was rather ironic about Adele, you know, she managed to kind of erm  erm  quell the   the French,
 
Well that's right.
But French was .
I have a big exclamation mark, yes.
Yes.
Besides  
The other French was okay, but the 
That's right.
French part was definitely 
Yes !
insulting.
She had an English ed education.
That's right, yes.
 
Erm 
Erm, I must ask a question 
Yes.
something that puzzled me as I read it, er 
Yes.
earlier on in the book was the  pictures that Rochester looked at
Mm.
and
Oh yes.
they seemed to me to be heavy with symbolism but I couldn't see anything.
He did say, were you happy when you painted them
Yeah.
you know?
Yes.
Apart from that, I thought, well  why are they there, you know?
Well, one of them
He was clever.
more or, is more or less is realized in a dream she has, just before she leaves Thornfield Hall, erm  in which she dreams she's lying in the red room again
Mm.
erm, er, where she had her nightmare 
That's right.
Mm.
and then, the ceiling turns into a sky, and then a, this sort of head and shoulders of a woman  er, compassionate woman, an arm reaches through, and a, and a face comes, and er, she says, erm  er, and it says, my child don't give in to temptation.
And she says, I won't mother.
Mm.
Now whether it's meant to be really her mother, or 
Mm mm.
in a sense that one might call women of the generation before yours mother, I'm not sure.
Mm.
And that's what spurs her to get up and flee Thornfield Hall.
Mm.
And that's  you see, this is one of the things that contemporary critics, some contemporary critics couldn't take, that Jane wanted Rochester as much as Rochester 
Mm.
wanted Jane.
Wanted Jane.
Mm.
Jane had her own sexuality
Mm.
had her own feelings, her own passion.
Mm.
Erm, the temptation was also on her side.
Mm!
She was not a passive little thing
Ooh!
No.
to be done with 
No.
as, as, as he would see fit.
She had her own feelings.
Yes.
Is that why this bit ?
Yes.
That's one of the reasons.
Yeah.
Cos it was written by men  about  well they wouldn't have known that though would they?
Cos er, it was, it was written under the   
No, no, no.
Na no, but there a lot of speculation
Mm.
in the time.
Yes.
Do you think that the er  it must be the war, the first world war, if you've been watching Testament of Youth, Fear and Britain's Testament of Youth, which I read years ago
Mm.
and the   
Mm mm.
but, when she says to her look, look father she wants to go to university 
Mm.
ah, oh na no!
Can't go there, that's, didn't he?
So I think that that 
 
first world war, sort of, really, opened up education to women and, and really more than anything.
Mm.
Isn't it terrible that it takes a war!
And that was nineteen fourteen, eighteen, it was quite a
 
Yes, but they all went into the factories didn't they?
Or they found bits 
Mm.
Yes.
Well what's, what's worrying is that this 
That's higher education.
that they, we're in a slump like to the thirties 
Yes.
Yes!
and it took the war to come out of that, what are we gonna get out of, get out 
Exactly!
of this?
Yes.
But we won't get onto that.
Perhaps we're talking about it.
That's a different subject for us.
Erm 
A  subject.
there were plenty of spirited women really, you know, a man came  from monied families who  didn't er, just go off er, you know
Yes.
Yes, I take your point, they were the monied fam 
 
erm 
Yes.
But there weren't.
Mm.
I mean the fact that they are so individualistic to us.
And  especially, I mean erm
Yes.
And Elizabeth Fry, who reformed 
Yes.
the prisons.
 
You could almost count them on the fingers of two 
Yes.
hands couldn't you?
Of course.
Yes.
Yeah.
Anyway, the Quakers were always different.
Yes.
Mm.
Er, I mean their women were always allowed to do things 
Yes they were.
weren't they?
They were much more enlightened as well.
They were never  their father.
Well no.
Ha.
Could do without them
Yes.
Erm  to come back to what we were saying about the paintings
Well my mind boggled with the iceberg and that.
Right.
Yes !
 
Cos,I'm eighty two now.
Yes.
I think it's  erm
Her expression.
her expression really of the psychological in 
Yes.
the novel.
Yes.
Mm.
Erm, it comes out in her dreams, Jane's dreams, particularly this baby she's always carrying, I mean 
Mm mm.
Oh yes.
if people know how to interpret what it means to be carrying a baby in a dream, please 
No.
tell me.
I mean
No.
apart from the superstitious one that somebody's going to die.
Yes.
Erm, which she sa Betty expresses.
Erm  and it is  sort of a controlled way, if you like, of, of allowing the the, the subconscious to be expressed.
Mm.
Like you, I couldn't interpret the paintings in any particular way, and I don't think we really need to.
I mean, maybe there are others who could, who can do it and explain them to me, and I'd be very grateful if they could but, erm  in detail 
 
but I  that's how I interpret anyway.
I've wasted twenty minutes on that!
  
Well it was very a very interesting, interesting image 
quite often 
isn't it?
Yes.
Because,
But quite often
so much of it's sub submerged.
Yes.
Yeah.
I mean, it could be passion, in fact.
Yes.
A little bit on the top, but so much underneath.
 
Yes.
Well, yes.
Yes.
It is an interesting 
 
image.
Obviously took Teddy twenty minutes  to think that this iceberg was a  it was   a, a valid symbol !
 
.
Thank you very much!
Well that's alright.
That's what reading's for, so you  
Well yes.
can bother.
That's right.
 
Was it because of the    passion that the   excuse me, these women seem to  er, be pres having that made them think that er, it wasn't er  a male who wrote the book or not?
That may well be one of the reasons, yes.
That, a passion was affirmative to a women.
I have a feeling that there is a female sort of tone about it.
Yes.
And 
Mm.
that there was also a, a sort of blow for freedom being struck if you like
Mm.
which perhaps a ma a male writer wouldn't
Mm.
make.
Mm.
It was also about the little girl wasn't it?
Who grows up, I mean, it was
Mm.
Yes.
I shouldn't think many men would have dared to have written  it was all her then, in the first person 
 
who was
About being a small child.
About being a small, little girl.
There's a lot about clothes.
Mhm mm.
Er, you know, Jane Austen, and and Bronte, they wrote quite a lot about clothes which meant probably, but  always, I felt the Trollope could see into the minds of women  you know, and he was good.
Yes.
But he didn't go into detail about what they were wearing, but there's quite a lot about what she was wearing 
Yes.
Thomas Hardy 
You know.
I think, is also excellent
Oh yes!
Oh yes!
He's very good.
Yes.
on women.
Let's look at some  erm  Gothic elements  er  it's no good saying page a hundred and one is it?
Do you mean that, when you say Gothic elements, do you mean  a heightening for mystery?
Yes?
Erm
Yes.
Because I 
I mean, I think what, what I think erm  Charlotte Bronte does in this, she introduces certain Gothic elements, which she then immediately undermines.
Mm mm.
Mm.
Er, and it's interesting to ask why?
And I thought we might look at a few of them.
Mm.
Erm
But surely the house is, a name or a  
 
Well
within this awful  voice.
 
That's right.
Yes.
But that's not so much the building as th 
Don't you think so?
as the a as terror, and 
Mm.
terror is another erm
Yes.
you know, part of it.
Oh, a bit of Gothic feeling.
Mm.
It's terror from the beginning.
I mean, terror 
Mm.
in the red room is deplorable!
Yes.
Yes.
There is indeed, yes.
Well part of that is awful!
And also the, the, the trip into Lowood  was also frightening.
Yes.
Yeah.
It was, yes.
The, er the
For somebody that age.
Erm  I was thinking more of the, this adult Jane  erm 
Mm mm.
coming to a bit 
But I thought the supernatural voices was, was Gothic wasn't it?
Mm.
Oh yes.
I think that's the one point that she doesn't undermine.
Mm.
The telepathic communication.
 
Yes.
And, and what about Mr Rochester's unexplained past?
That, that's always there isn't it?
Mm.
We never really know what happened.
It's very hard when you know this novel 
Is it ever explained?
to, to erm to try and remember what it was like when you read it for the first time.
Yes!
Has anybody read it for the first time for this course?
Right.
Do you feel
You .
I'm an expert on it!
Yes!
 
Yes.
Erm
Mm mm.
Did you feel a tremendous sense of mystery gathering around Rochester?
That there were clues put in here and there that things were not right, and that Jane was seeing all?
Erm
Before the ex you know, that she knew about Bertha.
Yes, I, I think it would be fair to say that, but you wondered  how he came to be the kind of man that he, she found him.
Mm.
But, yes, I, I think that'll be fair to say that.
Erm, I also found that,th surprisingly, that there's little touches of humour roundabout Rochester.
Mm mm.
Mm.
Which I found a little bit surprising.
Mm.
Mm.
Erm, the boy
Mm.
you know, and he said well produce your witness I've gone to hell.
And he said well I'll produce a witness first.
You know, I mean 
Yes.
sort of.
That's right, yes.
I thought, well that's odd!
You know, what  it's supposed to be a, a, a terror of a horror story
Mm mm.
Mm mm.
and  but I think it sort of highlight, er, she might have done it unconsciously or consciously, I don't know.
I think the erm  character of Rochester, yes, he comes across as a er er  as quite a mystery man.
Mm.
You keep finding out things about him, that 
Mm.
Yes.
you're not quite expecting.
Yes.
That's
Mm.
ah
You know, he, he looms up on the horse, you know 
Mm mm.
Mm.
Yes.
Turns out to be flesh and blood after all.
Yes.
Mm.
Well erm 
Falls off the horse.
There is a, a gesture there, of course, which is replicated right at the end isn't it?
When he, he leans on her to walk back to his horse
Mm mm mm.
and then he leans on Jane right at the 
Oh yes.
end
Oh.
to walk back into the house
Yes.
I see.
erm, when he's blinded and 
Mm mm.
erm
The trouble is, if you, if you read it as as ha many people have found  er, some years ago  and then 
Yes.
read Jean Rhys'  Wide Sargasso Sea.
Mm.
That's right.
That's right, yeah.
Yes.
And then you read it again
and you've got that in your mind 
Yes.
That's right.
of er
Absolutely!
Did you find that too?
Yes.
I found it very disturbing.
I, I couldn't finish it now.
In a sense that takes the Gothic out of Bertha
Mm.
Yes.
doesn't it?
Yes it does!
 
Yes!
Because it shows 
 
her own sufferings.
Yes.
Yes.
Erm, she is not something simply to be afraid of.
She has, you see how she has been pushed into this position.
Mm mm.
And how  two cultures failed entirely to understand each other.
Mm.
Mm.
And should never have been brought together in the first place.
And of course, if you look at it er, logically, I mean, for a  a woman to be tied up and kept in a room, you know, and kept prisoner all her life you could hardly expect her to  to be sane even if she did
have a chance to get  which 
Yes.
she wouldn't have been able to, I mean yo to 
Yes.
ti treat someone like an animal then
Yes.
they'll behave like an animal.
Yes.
Yeah.
So, I mean, it was clearly that, you know, of knowing how to deal with  mad 
Yes.
people.
I mean, what was madness  , if 
Yes.
we asked.
Erm  just looking at one or two references.
When, Mrs Fairfax is showing Jane over the house
Mm mm, mm.
erm, and she says do the, Jane asks,do the servants live in these rooms?
Mhm mm.
No, they occupy a range of smaller apartments to the back, no one ever sleeps here.
One would almost say that if there were a ghost at Thornfield Hall this would be its haunt  so I think .
We're up on the third floor here.
Mm.
Mm mm, mm.
Erm, whereas we know erm  Mrs Rochester is kept.
You have no ghost then?
Mm mm.
None that I ever heard of returned Mrs Fairfax smiling.
Nor any traditions of one, no legends or ghost stories?
I believe not.
And yet, it is said the Rochesters have been a violent than a quiet race in their time, perhaps though, that is the reason they rest tranq tranquilly in their graves now .
Erm, and then  a on we go, I mean,, and then she hears this laugh you see.
I 
Mm.
mean, are there ghosts, are there legends?
No, there aren't.
Mm.
Everything's okay, it's just the family, you know.
Mm.
Mm.
Erm, then she hears that laugh, you know, probably Grace Poole, did you hear it again?
Mm.
Erm, yes, you know and  er we 
That's a bit of the Gothic.
She's undercutting all the time.
Mm.
Mm.
It's the bit of the Gothic, except that we  know that this is, well we don't know then do we?
No.
No.
No, and it says erm   I really did not expect any Grace to answer .
Mrs Fairfax has just called Grace Poole.
Mm.
For the laugh was as tragic as preternatural a laugh as any I ever heard.
And, but that it was high noon and no circumstance of ghostliness accompanied the curious cachinnation.
But that neither scene nor season favoured fear, I should have been superstitiously afraid .
Mm.
But she wasn't.
Mm.
Cos it was high noon.
Mm.
And Mrs Fairfax had explained it.
Mhm mm.
However the event showed me I was a fool for entertaining a sense even of surprise .
So we have the Gothic set-up  and promptly knocked down again.
Mm mm mm.
So
And then it go comes up again with veil .
Oh yes.
It does indeed, yes.
I mean, erm  she actually then chooses to walk up and down the third storey  erm  couple of pages later, Jane, when she wants a bit of solitude.
Mm.
So it can't have been that frightening.
This place she chooses to think over her own hopes 
Well 
and plans and so on.
Erm, when she imagines that er  I think you pronounce it a Gytrash?
I don't know any other way of pronouncing it.
Mm mm.
A kind of ghost is going to be riding down the path  for er, when it's actually a Rochester
Mm mm.
you know.
Erm, it's only a trapper taking a short cut.
Mm.
But no Gytrash appeared she says, just a trapper taking a short cut.
All her fears  are then  all knocked down .
Mm.
So that you're having the Gothic set-up in this story  to be undermined by common sense.
Oh!
Mm.
A at the time it is raised, that's the interesting thing.
Not like, Mrs Radcliffe.
Mm mm.
Building tension and mystery to the end and then undermining it all.
No.
But er 
And even when they erm  the stranger comes  you know 
Mm mm.
who's the, the brother  and erm  had his  arm injured 
Oh yes.
Mm.
erm, he's , and even then she accepts doesn't she, or she appears to  accept what she's told?
Yeah.
She does, yes.
Mm.
I mean, there is one  when she says that Bertha's face reminded her of a vampire  I suppose that's probably the most Gothic moment.
Mm.
But then when you think that she did actually bite Mason!
Yes.
Of course.
Quite hard, I mean really hard!
Mm.
Yes.
Er, and tries to bite  Rochester on the face doesn't she?
Yes.
Yes.
Erm, then she becomes a sort of literal  th the vampire, as it were, is reduced and she becomes just a wild thing.
Mm mm.
Yeah.
So that actually that comment 
 
on her being a vampire is also undermined.
But she was a pyromaniac.
Because that wasn't the first  time, when she eventually burnt the place down 
Yes.
she tried before.
Yes.
Mm.
So she had this pyroma maniac  as well.
Yes.
I mean, are we to see  that as symbolic  the setting fire to Rochester's bed?
The burning bed?
Could well be.
Passionate bed perhaps?
Yes.
Mm mm!
Mm.
Certainly Jean Rhys  erm  I mean, I thought of Jean Rhys at that 
Mm.
point, extrapolates that backwards, if you can 
Mm mm.
extrapolate backwards.
Doesn't she?
I've forgotten a lot of the book.
I didn't have time to read it all  and  how  far in comparison with the other Gothic novels do you go before  you, as a reader, know about this woman er, kept up  you know, in er
The quarters.
 Abberton Forest 
Erm
Half way exactly 
Yes.
Should think about half way through 
 
it 
Yes.
, you know.
when you find out.
Mhm mm.
Erm
Mm.
It's incredible to me, that  Jane has all these er  er  things happening
Mm.
portents is the word?
Yes.
Or omens, yes.
Omens, yes.
And er  she never really, she's never really very curious
No.
a erm
Well she acc 
It is, it is never  he doesn't, not actively curious.
No.
She accepts
Right.
explanations doesn't she?
Mm.
Yes, she does.
But then you wouldn't 
Yes.
think of the mad wife being shut  up there 
No.
by
You might if you were Catherine Moorfield.
Yes .
 
It's a bit like this .
But Northanger Abbey is, but, she is absolutely 
But Northanger Abbey was definitely a bit curious!
Yes .
But, what I was going on to say was that  erm  Grace  what's her name?
Poole.
Grace.
Grace Poole.
Mm.
Er  everything's blamed, blamed onto Grace Poole but she's, but she 
I don't 
reappears!
Mm.
She's never dismissed.
Mm.
Oh yes.
And, wouldn't er  Jane  be inquiring about that?
Well
She does wonder about it, yes, but she's 
Oh yes.
ah, I mean, she's got a, a subordinate role in the house hasn't she?
Mhm mm.
Erm  I mean, and Mrs Fairfax is not really open to  erm  giving her the information 
No, er tha 
is she?
I think, doesn't she ask her at one point about Grace Poole?
Mm mm.
And Mrs Fairfax 
Oh!
Yeah.
turns the conversation.
Yes.
Mm.
Mm.
Erm 
But th the servants are all talking about  this erm, aren't they, at one point?
Yeah.
And she overhears them.
Mm.
But she, as you say, she's not really curious 
No.
to find out  why she's being kept in the dark and 
Yes.
everyone else knows.
Yes.
 
She's also told that it's Grace Poole that slept by the Rochester's bed.
Yes.
Mm.
Mm.
Erm, but things go on as usual.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
This is, I found intriguing.
Yeah, I found this 
Yes.
a bit hard to swallow.
Yes.
But she said he would explain 
Want to find out more.
you know 
Yes he did.
Mm.
He
Yo you know and  himself.
From their marriage, that's right.
Yes.
True.
But she knows that Grace Poole is a   and 
Yes.
she's been living with a brother .
Mm.
Mm.
Yes.
Erm  sorry!
Who's the liv 
Sorry!
Sorry!
I 
Who's been living with him?
too.
Oh!
Charlotte?
Char Charlotte Bronte.
 
Yes.
With the brother who drank.
Yes.
Yes.
So erm, she presumably being used to sort of accepting these  er, crises and behaviour
Yeah.
thinking it was drink, and so why shouldn't she acc in  that Jane Eyre accepts 
 
Grace Poole drinks and she gets your  erm 
Yes.
lively bits of  behaviour, but then 
Mm.
it all settles again and you have to accept it.
But why is she there?
Mm.
Yes.
.
She isn't curio I mean yo er  erm, I can see if you  it could get in the way of accepting the story.
Mm.
Erm, what I found actually  er erm  even odder, was that is, if the servants knew about her, why did nobody appear at the wedding ceremony?
Mm.
Why was it left to Mason 
Yes.
Yes.
to come forward?
He had been paid.
I don't, I don't think they knew that she was  was his 
His wife.
wife.
Don't know.
They knew that he had er erm
A mad woman.
a mad woman upstairs but I 
Yes.
don't see as though knew her was his wife.
Yes.
Well I said they  
Er but they did wor wonder whether it was erm
Mm.
Mm!
an ex-mistress
Yes.
a relation or 
Mm.
something.
Er it didn't come out even where the er, inn keeper is telling erm  her, telling Jane about what happened.
Mm.
And he obviously didn't know and it wasn't public knowledge that it was his wife that was 
Oh no.
kept there, it wasn't just 
No.
this woman.
Mm.
Yes, erm  
Erm, I think what  erm  the purpose for me, anyway, or the effect of under setting up the Gothic  in detail and then undermining it, is that when you do allow it to stand it's much more effective.
Mm.
Mm mm.
Mm.
And that, I think, is
Mhm mm.
I mean I know we, we, we can dispute that this telepa telepathic communication is actually rather far-fetched, but it is quite dramatic
Mm.
isn't it?
Mm.
That's right.
That at the moment at which she's about to submit
Mhm mm.
to St John  erm  she  hears the call as it were from somebody who really needs 
Mm.
her.
Doesn't just 
Even through the nightmare she .
Mm.
Yeah.
It's a, it's a er a prickle that nobody 
Yes.
can see.
And he heard the reply.
Mm.
Yes.
And he goes through  
Yes.
Yeah.
I think, even more frightening the fact that she might have succumbed to this chap .
 

I was saying,for God's sake don't do it!
 
I really was frightened that she might be off with him.
 
Well, what I found a bit erm  remarkable really, in the book
Mm.
was that er, parts of it were pure Hollywood weren't they?
Mm mm!
Mm mm.
Yes.
They really were!
Yes, but doesn't it come off when
Yeah!
they do the film of it, it's much more dramatic and eerie 
Yes.
than than the novel because you 
Yes.
don't get a rational explanation 
No.
in the film.
No you don't.
You get the atmosphere very strongly.
What will 
And it comes off far more as a  you know, as a sort of Gothic
Mm mm.
story 
Yes.
than, than the novel.
What could have been a really Gothic moment in the novel, and quite deliberately isn't, it seems to me, is Jane's confrontation of Bertha.
When after the disruptive 
Yes.
wedding ceremony, they all troop up to the third storey
Yes.
Yes.
to meet this mad 
Yes.
woman.
At this point we're, we're not having any of Jane's reactions.
We've got Rochester's  erm  monologue 
Account.
as it were 
Yes.
Mm.
Yes.
erm, a mixture of anger and shame and er, resentment and er, justification and so on.
And  he places his hand, as he said, on his Jane's shoulder and says this is i this quiet  girl standing there, this is what I wanted and look what I've, you know
Mm.
can you blame me when you see 
Yes.
what I've got?
Mm.
And, she is not terror stricken, she is not horrified, she's not cowering in a corner, Jane I mean.
No.
She's just standing there 
Really quite strong.
Yes.
taking it in.
Mm.
And she says later  sh you, you're too cruel, to Rochester, you can't blame her for being mad.
Mm mm!
And so, what could have been a really Gothic moment, isn't.
Mm.
And it seems to me, quite deliberately isn't.
It's made a moment of  er, dramatic moment  er, a compassionate moment 
 
Mm.
but not a Gothic moment.
But even the fire where, you know, the first fire, don't they, when she burnt house down  erm  that isn't made as terrifying as it 
No.
could have been.
No.
It's quite funny actually.
Yes.
Yes.
Because he wakes up and, and 
Yes.
says is there a flood?
What 
Yes!
That's right .
are you doing drowning me in my bed!
You know.
Yes !
Cos she's thrown all this water over him.
But I mean that's a terrifying thing to have found him in
Oh yes!
flames and er
And then there's one little 
 
sort of almost erotic flicker really, when she says I'll go and get a candle and he says, don't go yet.
Yes.
Yes.
Wait till I put something on.
I know.
Erm  and er, you could pass it.
 
You really could pass it.
Erm
and it's, you know  it's, part of life isn't it?
I 
It's 
couldn't help thinking if it was modern day  a woman that's  manically  depressed  dreamt that, dreamt she had, she was definitely mental, she would be stuck in a  a mental home and just kept under with er
Drugs.
Exactly!
drugs.
Yes.
She certainly wouldn't be roaming round.
And you know,won I wonder  whether 
She wasn't, yeah.
whether it's kind of him to keep her there
Mm mm.
because she's quite well looked after.
Well Exactly.
Yes.
Yes.
Mm mm.
Yes.
But there must have been cases weren't there?
Oh yes!
Yes, but that's to that would be terrible if you had this!
Yes, but that's then, I mean, perhaps Rochester was kinder.
Yes.
So, in case that does happen.
Yes.
Yeah, absolutely!
He, and then 
Yes.
he didn't want anybody to know, but I think in  he did that in the kinder fashion.
Mm.
That is possible actually, that he would want to keep it  from his neighbourhood.
Yes.
Mm.
True.
That he were married to a mad woman.
But if sh she was in care  
They would put her somewhere else though wouldn't
No.
Qui quite possibly they wouldn't.
So he would have been safer 
No.
wouldn't he, actually than 
Yes.
put her in  a mental hospital or a 
Mm.
or a mental institute.
Yes.
Mm.
Somebody in authority would have known that he was married though, but, probably not anybody who could have done anything about preventing another one.
No.
Mm.
Yeah, but we wouldn't have had the story would we?
Well 
No, quite!
Er er, in some cases 
 
they were beaten and tortured!
Oh!
That's right.
Yes!
Oh!
Dreadful, yes.
I think you just can't  
 
Yes.
Yes.
Yes it was a duty of them wasn't it?
Mm.
To beat the devil out of them.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Most dreadful time!
And left  abandoned there weren't they?
Oh 
Yes.
yes!
Yes.
They were.
Nasty!
Some are still.
Depicted in film 
 
erm, er, in that Tchaikovsky film, whatever 
Oh!
was it called?
The Music Makers.
Oh yes.
Mm.
Erm, with  Glenda Jackson.
Yes.
Mm.
Mm.
Absolutely 
 
incredible!
That, oh!
It was awful!
Did you see it?
No.
Oh!
It's, it's  it was absolutely incredible!
I think early in the eighteen twelve  
 
 
made it forever .
Really?
Mm.
Mm.
Oh Lord!
Well we had the Quakers 
Yeah.
to thank for improving the law on prisoners.
Oh yes!
We did.
And the mental , that's right.
I think 
Yeah.
they were wonderful!
At least prisons er 
What they did
Yes.
Absolutely!
Yes.
was amazing 
Yes.
and wonderful really!
Well that's right.
Mm.
Mm.
Yeah.
All the  
Erm 
Have we said all we want to say about  St John  and his  er, secessionism?
Oh yes.
I think so, yes.
Cos partly, I expect, his trouble was repression too.
I think that he was 
 
was such a fanatic erm, religious
Yes.
because he wa he was  obviously a very repressed man wasn't he?
Absolutely!
Spiritually and .
Yes.
And, and emotionally, he had repressed his
Yeah.
desire for Rosamond hadn't he?
Yes.
Mm mm.
Yes.
Erm, and that is the way that 
And spiritually.
erm  yo I mean he says at one point, as a positive statement, he thinks, that he bend, he's bending his nature out of its natural course
Mhm mm.
Mm.
in order to serve  God.
Mm mm.
Yes.
Whereas Jane sees that as unnatural.
Mm mm mm.
Yes, like 
Wasn't it 
that .
a typical religion though, that in that day and age when you were made to flagellate yourself, you were made, the whole time, to recognize your sin, and anybody who was masochistically inclined
Yeah.
was going to become a Rivers.
Mm.
Yes.
Afraid so.
And inflict it on others as 
Mm.
well.
As well.
Yeah.
And be a sadist as well.
You know Van Gogh er, he had a hired woman, and er he  definitely thought that was what he should do to actually put all his energies into his painting
Mm.
and
Mm.
and, well he didn't mind.
So it's best not to have .
Well that means Freud accepts that is one channel in which
Yes.
any unused sexual energies will go.
That's right.
It goes into creative.
Subjugating it 
Yes.
isn't it?
Yes.
Yes.
But erm    Rivers didn't exactly subjugate it did he?
I mean,
No.
evil came out of it.
It was a  and also was doted on by his two sisters.
Mm.
Wasn't he?
Yes.
Although they recognized that Jane's lot with him in, I mean, they wanted Jane 
Oh yes!
to marry him
Mm mm.
but once they knew it meant going to India
Mm.
and that she didn't care 
Mm.
for him, then erm  they, they  supported her.
Yes.
Oh yes, but 
Well no, they didn't.
er they did dote on him, you know, rather spoiltly.
Yes.
But,
It makes you wonder why.
So I think when we have these
He was good looking.
erm  er  portraits of, er men  you have to take i it that  erm  we could argue Charlotte Bronte was very critical of the men she knew and, the men she  thought she might know, and didn't  erm, you have to look at the women who feed into the making of them
Mm mm.
don't you?
As you say, you have to look at  Mrs Reed 
That's right.
and 
Mm.
the making of John.
And, perhaps the sisters, and the making of St John.
Mm.
But the men had the power didn't they?
They erm
Yes.
they, they had all the power.
So, women had, well what else could they do but kind of 
Mm.
Well the women were chattels weren't they?
In fact, you know, they, they just belonged
Mm.
to the men and 
Yes.
either their fathers, or their husbands.
Mm.
Yes.
But Mrs Reed's children, er, three of them, all a re a reflection of her wickedness.
Mhm mm.
Mm.
If you can put it like that.
Mm.
Mm.
Yes.
Cos the two er, girls
Mm mm.
who are, were  extraordinary
Mm.
and they didn't fit into life, did they?
Well 
Into the world.
Well, one was to 
No one became a nun didn't she?
Yes.
Yes.
One was to, one should have married 
 
St John  Eliza.
Yes.
That's it, yes.
Eliza and St John could have
bored each other rigid!
Yes.
Yes.
Erm
Some
Murdered each other actually.
 
Yes, probably !
And the one that was indulged
Georgiana.
was was 
Yes.
completely useless!
Yes.
Absolutely hopeless!
She was pretty.
Er, she was pretty, she was 
Er, she'd been ruined hadn't ?
she was lumpish 
All curls.
Yes.
she went sort of, she just sort of spread and got lazy didn't 
Yes.
she?
You know, in everything she did, er physically, mentally, you know 
Self indulgent.
Yes.
Absolutely.
Er, and John just went wild.
Mm.
Yes.
I mean, erm
What's your explanation for Mrs Reed wanting to see Jane again?
You know, where she, she finds her
Ah!
That's an interesting question.
I'm sure she went to heaven or thereabouts.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
The extensible answer is to try and clear her conscience, to tell 
Mm mm.
her about this uncle
Yes.
who wanted to leave her money.
Yes, yes, that's that's a  wasn't it?
Erm, it's the go I mean you, you can or not er, decided whether you're going to believe in a woman who is so vindictive  that she's going to allow them  er, prevent her having her rightful
Mhm.
erm, legacy.
Mhm mm.
Erm  because, she is of an equal status
Mm.
with her own children.
Mm.
Mm.
They are cousins.
Mm.
Mm.
Yes!
Erm, and obviously the fact that she's sent to Lowood shows that it's
Mm.
her education's being pa paid for at the cheapest possible
Mm mm.
er, rate
Yes.
by Mrs Reed.
Mm mm.
And, and that's only because her husband were on a promise from her.
Mm mm.
Mm.
Erm  I think it's, er  an original mark of the book  that they don't make it up.
No, they don't.
No.
I don't think they should make it up.
No.
I think there are some gulfs which cannot be bridged.
Mm mm.
Mm.
And if, Charlotte Bronte had had  reconciliation there I think it would have 
Oh!
It would have been er awful 
Yes.
wouldn't 
Yes.
it?
It would.
And she 
No, she just turned  away from her didn't 
Yes.
she?
She did.
After she'd
It's a deathbed confession to 
Mm.
exculpate her  her 
Yeah.
her wrong-doing
That's right.
but, no way did she have any affection for her then.
Oh, well Mrs Reed's nasty!
And contin died hating  er 
Yeah.
Jane didn't she?
She did anyhow.
Oh yes!
So that was on her
Mm.
But it had served the purpose of making Jane know about her 
 
uncle 
Yes.
didn't it?
That's right.
This uncle who was also  presumably  the uncle of  er, not only the Rivers' children, but would he also have been the uncle of Re Mrs Reed's 
Yes.
children?
Yes 
Oh!
Yes!
he would, her brother's  erm 
mm.
Yes.
husband's brother wasn't he?
That's right.
But he also gives you a feeling that she was trying to show the difference good and evil, in other words, Jane refused to hate her but she did hate her.
Mm.
Mm.
You know what I mean?
Yes.
Mm.
All the way through.
Mm.
Hate gets you nowhere.
Yes, she felt sorry for her.
There is, erm, a Victorian literary convention also, being slightly worked against here, er, if anybody knows David Lodge's novel, Nice Work.
Yeah.
Mm.
Anybody know Nice Work?
Mm mm.
Erm, features er a female university lecturer who's who  says of the Victorian novel that it comes out right by marriage, er either marriage, legacy, or  I can't remember what the other one was, there were three categories.
And Jane certainly gets her legacy.
Yes.
But she gets her legacy, erm, in order to be able to show that she doesn't need it.
Mm.
Mm mm.
Mm mm.
In order to be able to, not give 
Yes.
it up, you don't have to 
No.
give it up
But she did share it.
but,yo er she did share, yes.
Yes.
And, and to be able to  if you like, bring it as a dowry, but it wouldn't have mattered if she hadn't a penny.
Yes.
The sim the same with Helen Huntingdon.
Oh yes.
Yes.
Quite.
Mm.
And you may as well have it if it doesn't matter because 
Mm.
then you can show, as an author, that it doesn't matter.
Mm mm.
If you haven't got it  then you could just, er other people just could be nice when they marry you and say that it 
 
doesn't matter that you haven't got it.
Mm.
No.
But if you've got it and it doesn't matter, then you can really show it doesn't matter.
And bearing in mind  that anything that she had would automatically become Rochester's.
Mm.
Yes.
Yes.
Er, you know, because anything belonging to a wife belonged to her husband at that time.
That's right.
But he would also, in the spirit of their marriage, they 
Mm.
they pooled everything  didn't they?
I mean, it was obvious that it was going to be  erm, well, I mean, she'd been married, she's married, ten years
Mm.
by the time
er the book ends.
Yes.
And this is a question that always occurs to me  and I've read this novel several times, at the end of it  why did she write it?
Not why did Charlotte Bronte write it, why does Jane Eyre write it?
Why does she write this story?
Do you think?
Because it's a long road from  sad des desolation, being orphaned  to true happiness.
It's a love re really.
Yes.
It is a love story.
It's also a spiritual journey and a, and a movement 
It's this 
to belonging and
journey of fulfilment isn't it?
Yes.
Having some
some fulfilment  through adversity.
Yes.
Really.
Why would you need to write it  if you'd had the journey?
To get it out of yourself a 
And exult 
to  make the beginning 
Possibly yes.
yes, to erm  rational well to erm  explain the beginning, you know, to, to get the  hatred and the erm, sense of injustice out of your system.
Interest which is, for er for the children.
And also exposing
Possibly.
Interest the children, yes.
exposing erm  this to society  what goes on in society.
Well 
Yes.
We don't get any sense of Jane actually publishing this do 
No.
we?
No
Or cross advertising either though.
I've got no idea.
Mm.
It's a flaw 
But they flaunted it didn't she?
in the story for me.
Well why do people write their autobiographies?
Yes!
Exactly!
Yes.
So that she wouldn't 
Yes.
forget it?
Yes, there's that.
There are hints, there are passages here and there where she goes into the present tense.
Mm.
Yes.
Oh yes.
Yes.
Yeah.
And if, it's as if she were writing a diary, I decided.
Yes.
That was the effect 
 
it had on me.
Well, more or less, she talks to the reader  and 
She does talk to the reader, yes.
Maybe 
Yes.
she feels that the whole thing needs rationalizing and that she's just come,co come to the pi the point where she can rationalize everything for once in her life.
Yes.
Yes.
And 
Yes.
she doesn't also want to forget 
Yes.
it.
But then Maude did the same.
Same ending 
And no 
entirely.
Maude, ten years after  er, sitting there surrounded by her little ones
Yes.
erm  and the man she loved.
And she went through the same circum got exactly the same ending.
It could be telling the children all of it in fact.
Yes.
It could be, yes.
Mm mm.
Mm.
I do I mean, I'm asking you questions which I don't know the answer.
Yeah.
There's a note here that the general confusion of dates and eras and passions and facts  is even more irrational that anything Dickens did!
Well of course!
She couldn't have got the  be because she wasn't yet twenty one.
Oh I see.
Is it becau 
Yeah.
She does seem to have quite a free hand for a woman under twenty one
Mm.
didn't she?
Mm.
And suppo I assumed it's because she was orphan.
It is really understandable 
and, you know, if people don't care for you they aren't going to stop 
No.
you doing certain things.
No.
I mean, in the last 
Don't you think?
chapter she appeals to the reader, I know I came from etcetera, etcetera
Yeah.
so in the end she is
Yes, we can be
